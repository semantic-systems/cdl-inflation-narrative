         "New Central Bank Chief Named In Argentina\n\n \n\n  BUENOS AIRES -AP- Argentina's minister of economy, Antonio Erman Gonzalez, said he has accepted the resignation of central bank President Rodolfo Rossi and that Enrique Folcini, a conservative economist, had been chosen to replace him. \n\n  Gonzales said that Rossi, who had been named chief of the central bank a little more than a month ago, \"had not been fired,\" noting that he would continue as an adviser on banking to Argentina's President Carlos Menem. \n\n  Rossi said he had resigned because of a dispute with private banking concerns. \n\n  Folcini will be the fourth central bank president since Menem took office a little more than six months ago. \n\n  Folcini was director of the central bank during the military regime that took power in 1976. \n\n  Rodolfo Rossi, who lasted five weeks as president of Argentina's central bank, was forced out by private banks troubled by the government's decision on Jan. 1 to convert several billion dollars of short-term certificates of deposits to 10-year bonds, analysts said. \n\n  That move curtailed currency speculation that was devaluing the austral in great chunks, and brought down interest rates that in December topped a ruinous 600% a month, by abruptly restricting the money supply. \n\n  However, private banks argued that reserves held by the Central Bank are not enough to cover the new bonds, and wrangled with Economy Ministry officials to expand the use of the bonds. \n\n  Specifically, banks want approval to buy bonds on the secondary market, where they are trading at about half-price, and use them, at full value, to cancel debts owed to investors and the government. \n\n  \"Of course, that would be tremendously profitable for them,\" a Central Bank official said in a telephone interview.  \"Of course, the state can't allow them to do that.\" \n\n  Rossi opposed that plan and suggested that a compensatory fund be set up to resolve banks' losses, but deny them excess profits. \n\n  Rossi's resignation was rumored for days. In fact, he handed it to Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez last Friday, the Central Bank official confirmed. \n\n  In his short tenure, Rossi also reportedly lost favor with his own Union of the Democratic Center political party when the Central Bank printed 1 trillion australs this month, an amount that almost doubled the money supply. \n\n  That monetary expansion, which Rossi had pledged to quell, almost certainly will fuel inflation, which soared by 40% in December and is projected to increase by at least that much this month. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 22, 1990 11:37 ET (16:37 GMT)\n",

         "Greenspan - Disturbances -2-\n\n \n\n  Fed Chairman Greenspan told the Ways and Means Committee that \"although foreign direct investment in the U.S. has grown very rapidly, it is still relatively small.\" \n\n  For manufacturing as whole, he said, the direct investment affiliates accounted for 13 pc of assets and 11 pc of sales in 1987, the last year for which data were available. \n\n  Greenspan said one area of foreign direct investment of particular concern to the Fed was the banking industry, saying foreign-bank banks account for about one-fifth of all banking assets in the U.S. \n\n  But in many cases, he added, foreign banks conduct largely international transactions at their U.S. offices. \n\n  He warned that departure from a policy of \"national treatment\" in the banking industry could produce retaliation and could seriously complicate negotiations to ensure the access of U.S. banks to markets abroad, particularly to Europe after 1992. \n\n  Greenspan told the panel that globalization of markets benefit both the U.S. and the rest of the world, and repeatedly warned that efforts to insulate the U.S. from the forces of increasing globalization could be very costly. \n\n  At the same time, the Fed chairman said, continued efforts should be made to limit risks in international payments and securities settlement systems and to protect investors by increasing international cooperation and coordination of supervision and regulation. \n\n  Saying the U.S. could help ensure the orderly progress of global integration by reducing its current account imbalance, Greenspan said: \"The necessary policies are not those that attack the symptoms - large accumulations of foreign assets in the U.S. - but rather policies that address the underlying cause, which is our inadequate national savings, particularly our large federal budget deficit.\" \n\n  Fed Chairman Greenspan told the House panel that portfolio considerations are playing an important role in the globalization of securities markets. \"As the welfare of people in the United States and abroad becomes increasingly dependent on the performance of foreign economies, it is natural for both individual investors and institutions to raise the share of foreign securities in investment portfolios,\" he said. \n\n  In discussing forces facilitating the globalization of capital markets, Greenspan said one factor contributing to an increase in Japanese gross investments abroad may have been the rise in stock and land prices in Japan that has been leveraged to finance these increased investments. \n\n  During the 1980s, Greenspan said, the U.S. net international investment position, as reported by the Commerce Department, \"fell sharply from a positive $141 billion at the end of 1981, to a negative $533 billion at the end of 1988.\" \n\n  But, he said, these numbers should not be viewed as precise measures of the U.S.'s net international indebtedness for various technical reasons.  Still, he said, \"the direction and magnitude of recent changes are clear consequences of the U.S.'s current account deficits.\" \n\n  He said growing U.S. net international indebtedness and the U.S.'s large current account deficits are two sides of the same coin. \n\n  He said that \"the most important underlying cause of the surge in our net borrowing from foreigners and the deterioration in our external balance has been the substantial decline in our national savings rate against the background of a relatively stable investment rate.\" He said the decline in savings reflected in part the expansion of the budget deficit. \n\n  \"The fundamental accounting identity between savings and investment, of course, requires that any shortfall of domestic savings below domestic investment be made up in the form of a net inflow of savings from abroad,\" Greenspan said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 25, 1990 10:36 ET (15:36 GMT)\n",

Lee, president and chief executive officer, told Dow Jones. \n\n  For 1988, net income was $53.6 million, or $1.35 a unit, on revenue of $208.2 million. \n\n  \"1989 was a record year for homebuilding,\" Lee said. The house building, commercial development and agriculture company said it expects revenue for the year to be about $238 million, up 14 pc from 1988.  The company has withdrawn almost completely from the oil and gas business, Lee said. \n\n  Fourth quarter net income was between $28 million and $29 million, or from 70 cents to 75 cents a unit, he said, compared to net income of $10.1 million, or 25 cents a unit. The record-for-any-quarter performance was due to significant housing completions in the quarter, Lee said.  Revenue was about $97 million, Lee said, compared to revenue of $69.8 million for the comparable 1988 period. \n\n  A two-for-one partnership unit split was distributed Jan. 29 and the 20-cent distribution likely will remain at least until the end of the year. \n\n  Lee said the company will continue to repurchase units, noting that since the beginning of this year Newhall Land has repurchased 750,000 units and a total of 14 pc of the outstanding units since the repurchasing program began in Novomber 1987.  Currently, there are about 38 million units outstanding. \n\n  Lee said Newhall's total appraised land value exceeded $1 billion for the first time ever at Dec. 31, 1989.  \"It's a reflection of the rising land values in California,\" he said, noting that the trend is expected to continue.  \"Over the last five years, the appraised values have grown at a compound annual rate of 19 pc,\" he added. \n\n  Lee said the residential real estate market has slowed somewhat this year but the company expects 1990 will be a \"very good year\" at its giant industrial parks in Valencia, a rapidly-growing area about 30 miles north of Los Angeles. \n\n  At the company's Valencia Industrial Center, building absorption last year was 1.4 million square feet, up 40 pc from the average of the prior three years. \n\n  About two million square feet remain to be sold and developed at the 1,500-acre industrial center, but at the company's nearby 1,600-acre Valencia Commerce Center, there is room for about 11 million square feet of commercial and industrial buildings. \n\n  \"1990 could be a tremendous year for us,\" Lee said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 13, 1990 12:46 ET (17:46 GMT)\n",

Steve Neal, D-N.C., champions a \"zero inflation\" measure that has been endorsed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. \n\n  Greenspan sees the zero inflation goal achieved when \"expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions.\" \n\n  Greenspan told Congress last week that the current inflation rate of about 4.5 pc is \"unacceptable\" and that inflationary expectations are rising moderately worldwide. This, coupled with Greenspan's view that chances of a recession are waning, created an immediately generalized perception in Fed-watching circles that monetary easing has been put on hold. \n\n  Also, Greenspan cited as a cause of higher long-term interest rates in the U.S. the diversion of Japanese and European capital from the U.S.  due to rising interest rates abroad. Economist Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., put it this way: \"Right now, foreign rates are providing a floor, or elevator if you will, to American interest rates.  In this environment, the Fed's ability to influence the course of American interest rates, and thereby the economy, is severely limited, if not crippled.\" \n\n  Still, the Congressional Budget Office said last Friday that most private-sector forecasters share its view that \"the Federal Reserve will safely steer the economy between the shoals of a recession and higher inflation by further reducing interest rates this year.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 05, 1990 12:49 ET (17:49 GMT)\n",

In its advance report, the department had reported durable goods orders rose 2.5 pc. \n\n  The December factory orders increase compared with an unrevised increase of 2.4 pc in November to an adjusted $239.71 billion and an unrevised 0.1 pc decline in October to an adjusted $234.07 billion. \n\n  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report survey of 12 economists published yesterday found an average estimate of a 1.6 pc gain in December factory orders. \n\n  For all of 1989, factory orders rose 6.4 pc to $2.830 trillion, after rising 9.7 pc in 1988, Commerce said. \n\n  For all of 1989, durable goods orders rose 5.9 pc to $1.520 trillion, after rising 11.0 pc in 1988, Commerce said. \n\n  Factory orders are not adjusted for inflation. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 02, 1990 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\n",

Banks were closed on Tuesday for three days to halt frenzied speculation, and police were called to shops that illegally increased prices. \n\n  Collor de Mello promised to revert the unprecedented economic crisis.  \"Inflation is enemy No. 1,\" he said. \"My presidency will wager everything on victory against this social cancer.\" \n\n  He said Brazil would encourage modernization of the largely state-controlled economy and welcome foreign investment. \n\n  Expectations of a brief wage-and-price freeze, massive layoffs of federal employees and other drastic measures to cut Brazil's $31 billion budget deficit sent tremors across the nation of 150 million people. \n\n  Government officials ordered shop owners not to raise prices, and police visited stores that failed to heed the warning.

         "Dayton Hudson Says 4th Period Net Rose 37% On 9% Sales Gain\n\n \n   By Francine Schwadel \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  MINNEAPOLIS -DJ- Dayton Hudson Corp. expects to report earnings of $250 million, or $3.45 per fully diluted share, for the 14-week fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth A.  Macke. \n\n  In the 13-week period a year ago, the company earned $182 million, or $2.31 a share. The per-share figures represent a sharper rise  than net income because Dayton Hudson repurchased seven million shares. \n\n  Macke told Dow Jones in an interview that the expected 37% earnings increase is due to a strong performance at the company's retail units and to a credit for adjusting inventories for inflation. \n\n  Dayton Hudson plans to release its earnings on Thursday. \n\n  Macke attributed the strong showing to a 9% increase in sales to $4.48 billion from $4.1 billion a year-earlier.  But he said the fourth-quarter figures also got a boost from a credit of $31 million, or 26 cents a share, for adjusting the company's inventories for inflation.  In the year-ago quarter, such adjustments resulted in a charge of $8 million, or 6 cents a share. \n\n  For the 53-week fiscal year, Macke said Dayton Hudson would report record earnings of $410 million, or $5.35 a share on a fully diluted basis.  That represents a 43% increase over the $287 million, or $3.45 a share, the company earned in its previous fiscal year. \n\n  Sales in the latest fiscal year rose nearly 12% to $13.64 billion from $12.2 billion, he said.  He said inventory adjustments for the year resulted in a charge of less than $1 million, or less than 1 cent a share, compared with charges of $44 million, or 32 cents a share, in fiscal 1988. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 13, 1990 15:33 ET (20:33 GMT)\n",

         "Dollar Ends Lower In N.Y.; At 1.6780 Marks, 158.73 Yen\n\n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- Strong buying of deutsche marks on renewed confidence in the Deutsche Bundesbank's ability to control West German inflation sent the dollar 2 pfennigs lower against the West German currency Wednesday. \n\n  Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.6780 deutsche marks, down sharply from 1.6980 marks late yesterday in New York.  The U.S.  currency was also changing hands at 158.73 yen, below 158.95 yen in New York late yesterday.  Sterling was trading at $1.6405, higher than $1.6347 late yesterday. \n\n  The U.S. currency also ended the day moderately lower against the yen amid broad dollar weakness inspired by the market's bullish stance on the mark and participants' continuing focus on non-dollar dealings, traders said. \n\n  The mark began its surge at the beginning of the European day after the release of news on the Bundesbank's 1989 annual report, in which it pledged to maintain a strong mark as a means to help contain inflation. \n\n  The annual report, which suggested that the central bank was prepared to defend the mark either through intervention or by raising interest rates, relaxed market anxiety about the ramifications of monetary integration that had damped interest in the West German currency recently, participants said. \n\n  Typical of the market's reaction to the central bank's annual report was a comment by Carl Amendola, a vice president at Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG in New York, who expressed confidence that \"any inflationary outburst will be handled in the most efficient manner by the Bundesbank.\" \n\n  The report was also seen as reassurance that the central bank will have the last word on how the consequences of monetary union are managed, following the West German government's decision to apply a 1 deutsche mark-to-1 Ostmark exchange ratio more widely than the Bundesbank had recommended. \n\n  The Bundesbank news also served to fuel another day of strong mark gains against the yen, lending added impetus to a shift toward long mark positions in mark-yen dealings that began yesterday.  The West German currency rose to around 94.59 yen late today in New York from 93.99 yen in late Tokyo dealings and from 93.61 yen late yesterday in New York. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 25, 1990 17:29 ET (21:29 GMT)\n",

And recessions are often followed by \"a shot in the arm\" for the economy, which can spawn an inflation problem all over again, he added. \n\n  Parry spoke to Dow Jones a few days after the government reported that the consumer price index rose at an 8.5 pc annual rate in the first quarter, its fastest pace since the spring of 1982, when the country was emerging from a wrenching bout of double-digit inflation. Much of the winter spike stemmed from a surge in food and energy prices after a bitter cold wave wiped out crops and boosted energy use, depleting supplies. \n\n  Over the past 12 months, according to the government, consumer prices have risen 5.2 pc. Citing a recent retreat of energy prices from their January highs, Parry said inflation was likely to fall back below 5 pc for 1990, but he predicted the rate would be faster than the 4.6 pc pace for 1989. \n\n  Parry said the best recipe for curing inflation is slow, steady growth over the long haul. But he predicted that the economy's current pace of expansion will lead only to mild gains against inflation. \n\n  Parry forecast that the economy's inflation-adjusted growth in 1990 will be \"slightly over 2 pc,\" compared with 1989 growth of 3 pc.  But he said he \"wouldn't be upset if growth were a little lower.\" \n\n  Two percent growth this year \"will help but it isn't going to produce any significant change in inflation,\" he explained. \"If (the economy's) potential growth is 2.5 pc to 3 pc the amount of slack that likely to result from growth a little over 2 pc is not that great.\" \n\n  Parry estimated that growth in the first quarter could have been \"as high as 2.5 pc to 3 pc.\" Next Friday, the Commerce Department will disclose its first estimate of first-quarter growth. \n\n  Parry does not currently vote on the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 20, 1990 14:58 ET (18:58 GMT)\n",

         "Bank Of Japan Warns Land Prices Could Turn Lower\n\n \n\n  TOKYO -DJ- The steady rise in Japanese land prices in the late 1980s could turn around and trigger widespread financial problems, the Bank of Japan warned. \n\n  History doesn't bear out a view common among individuals as well as corporations in Japan \"that land prices will keep climbing and never decline,\" the central bank cautioned in a report.  Despite contrary examples, that sense of inevitability is driving economic decisions and poses a risk to the economy. \n\n  The Bank of Japan urged legal and tax reforms to eliminate incentives for property speculation and encourage more efficient land use.  In the meantime, it said, finanicial institutions must be monitored closely to insure that a tumble in land prices doesn't lead to turbulence in the financial system and undermine the value of the currency. \n\n  Scarcity is typically cited as the basic factor underlying high Japaness land prices. \"But more fundamentally, institutional factors such as the tax and legal systems seem to work to push up land prices by inhibiting the more efficient utilization of land,\" the Bank of Japan said. \n\n  Cases in the U.S. and the U.K. show that when land prices climb steeply over a short period, they may turn lower again, adversely affecting financial institutions involved in property lending, the Bank of Japan noted. In the case of the savings and loan boondoggle in the U.S. and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K., falling land prices upset the financial system and hit lower-tier institutions and non-bank financial firms in particular. \n\n  While both the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry have instructed banks to cut back their lending for property purchases, non-bank institutions such as leasing firms have moved to fill the gap in funds. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 09, 1990 08:47 ET (12:47 GMT)\n",

         "Fed - Weak Growth, High Inflation -2-\n\n \n\n  In April, the producer price index is expected to have risen 0.2 pc, with the index seen up 0.3 pc if food and energy prices are excluded, according to the average estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. \n\n  A PPI report in line with market expectations would not be enough to prompt a Fed easing, says Foster of Citibank. \n\n  Before the Fed will seriously consider an easing move, the inflation data \"would have to show a bouncing off from the recent trend,\" says Foster. \n\n  But, she adds, \"with the economy showing signs of slowing, the next move will be an easing,\" although the timing is far from certain. \n\n  The FOMC has been deeply split recently, with some members calling for an easing in order to bolster an unstable economy and others urging a tightening as the only means of purging the economy of inflation, which has failed to abate. \n\n  A big question about the upcoming FOMC meeting is \"just how far the more hawkish members are willing to push the fear-of-inflation scenario if the real sector is not showing the kind of strength\" that would threaten to push inflation higher, says Engler of Chemical Bank.  \"It will be interesting to see if they hold the line on their anti-inflation bias.\" \n\n  A once-dormant factor that has moved to the forefront in terms of monetary policy is the federal budget deficit, which is expected to be so far out of line with the Gramm-Rudman targets that congressional leaders and the President have agreed to sit down and discuss plans to reduce it significantly. \n\n  The planned budget summit has prompted so much enthusiasm that some market participants say it alone is reason to consider an easing. \n\n  \"The Fed would like nothing more than a grand compromise\" that resulted in a reduced deficit, says Johnson of First Chicago. \n\n  \"If the Fed were sure they would get one, they would be more inclined to ease.  But they are a long way from assuming that anything will get done,\" he says. \n\n  If Congress and the administration \"agree on a plan that was convincing, with increased taxes and spending cuts, at some point the Fed would have to follow with an easing of policy, especially if the plan was put in place with an economy that was weak,\" says Engler. \n\n  But given the persistence of the deficit, and the repeated failure to successfully deal with it which has resulted in a justified skepticism by market participants, \"it would have to be a done deal\" before the Fed would consider responding with a change in policy, Engler contends. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 10, 1990 16:02 ET (20:02 GMT)\n",

         "New Milk Subsidies Included In 1990 Farm Legislation\n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON -AP- A revision of government support for dairy farmers is being included in the 1990 farm bill. \n\n  The House Agriculture Committee completed work yesterday on the key portions of its dairy section of the bill that will set government policy on agriculture for the next five years. \n\n  Earlier in the day, the Senate Agriculture Committee approved legislation that makes seafood inspection part of the farm bill for the first time. \n\n  Under the House committee's dairy plan, the current government price would never go below $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk. \n\n  If surpluses fall below 3.5 billion pounds, the government would pay $10.55 per hundredweight.  Additional conditions are included in the bill. \n\n  The government traditionally has supported dairy farmers by setting a price it will pay for storable dairy products, like cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk, that aren't bought by processors in the open market. \n\n  However, overproduction has been an expensive problem for the government which lawmakers have been trying to correct. Gunderson said the new program would continue to move toward greater market orientation. \n\n  -0- \n\n  Committee staffers estimated that the dairy plan would cost $1.6 billion more than what the current dairy program would cost if it were extended for the next five years. But they said that the plan would still be consistent with Senate Budget Committee guidelines, which House lawmakers are prepared to follow in the event of a deficit-reduction agreement. \n\n  The government buys surplus cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk whenever commercial demand isn't sufficient to keep milk prices from slipping below the support price. \n\n  If government purchases were forecast to exceed seven billion pounds in any year, the Agriculture Department could inaugurate an inventory management program, beginning in 1992, to hold down milk production. \n\n  The compromise was offered by Rep.  Charles Stenholm (D., Texas), chairman of the dairy subcommittee, and Rep.  Steve Gunderson (R., Wis.), the ranking minority member, as an alternative to a plan that had been embraced earlier by the subcommittee. \n\n  That plan would have set a floor price of $10.60 per hundred pounds, imposed assessments on dairy farmers to discourage production and created a standby system of two-tier price supports. The Bush administration and some farm groups strongly objected to a two-tier system. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 23, 1990 08:47 ET (12:47 GMT)\n",

However, he called Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's call for zero inflation \"pie in the sky.\" \n\n  Smith confirmed Labour's support for taking the pound into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the EMS to help ensure the country's economic recovery.

         "Argentina Makes $40 Mln Debt Payment To Foreign Creditors\n\n \n\n  BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -AP- Argentina has made a $40 million payment to foreign creditors, the first since foreign debt payments were suspended more than two years ago, government officials said today. \n\n  Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, confirmed that payments had been renewed following \"arduous\" discussions in New York between Central Bank Vice President Javier Gonzalez Fraga and individual creditor banks. \n\n  The payment, ministry sources said, is considered \"a gesture of good will\" aimed at aiding Gonzalez Fraga in talks scheduled to began this week with a consortium of private creditors. \n\n  Argentina, the developing world's third largest debtor, owes a total of $60 billion in loans plus unpaid interest that could reach $8.5 billion by the end of the year. \n\n  Ministry sources said the government hopes to negotiate an agreement to pay $300 million in overdue interest by the end of the year.  The creditors reportedly have sought payment of $500 million. \n\n  In the event negotiators reach agreement, Argentina would make another interest payment of between $70 million and $80 million, ministry sources said. \n\n  The 11-month-old government of President Carlos Menem is seeking debt forgiveness, approval for debt capitalization and new loans. \n\n  Negotiations with a steering committee that represents private banks, which are owed a total of $40 billion, are likely to be difficult.  Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, for example, reportedly has written off 40% of its loans to Argentina as uncollectable and resents having done so. \n\n  Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund has indicated it approves of Menem's policy of budget austerity and privatizations, and recently unblocked payment of a $1.7 billion loan granted last October and suspended five months later. \n\n  Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, said $240 million of the unblocked funds \"have already entered the country\" and that a new installment of the same amount would be disbursed by early August. \n\n  Argentina is emerging from two bouts of hyperinflation and is mired in recession.  Inflation, which hit 96% in March, dropped to 11% in April but is expected to be slightly higher for May. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 07, 1990 11:48 ET (15:48 GMT)\n",

Earnings for the  sector also were lower than those of a year earlier, he added. \n\n  Selling prices in the company's chemicals sector and parts of its consumer products business also have been under pressure, Albers said, although prices for feedstocks, energy and agrochemicals have been \"pleasingly stable.\" \n\n  He said there continues to be strong customer demand for BASF's consumer products, notably the company's line of pharamceutical. \n\n  And sales of colors, dyes and finishing product lines expanded during the first half in Europe and improved \"somewhat\" on last year's financial result, Albers said without being more specific. \n\n  He added that the company's information systems business has had \"clearly higher\" first half sales, although earnings have \"not been keeping pace everywhere.\" \n\n  Albers said he expects the magnetic tape operations be more competative following the acquisition of most of Bayer AG's Agfa-Gevaert AG tape cassette operations. \n\n  BASF didn't disclose complete half-year financial data, which will be made public at a later date. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 28, 1990 07:33 ET (11:33 GMT)\n",

         "Bethlehem Steel Interview -2-\n\n \n\n  Even though the steel industry as a whole will ship less in 1990 - about 80 million tons compared to 84 million in 1989 - the drop is considered relatively small.  Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman Walter F.  Williams noted in a Dow Jones interview that the industry shipped around 100 million tons in 1980 and two years later was only shipping 62 million tons. \n\n  \"The industry is more stable now,\" he said, as more efficient steelmakers have slashed capacity and costs.  He believes the industry will continue to ship around 80 million tons in the foreseeable future, with a possible low of 75 million tons and a high of about 83 million tons.  \"That's a heck of a lot better than a swing of 40 million tons,\" he said. \n\n  As a result, although Wall Street views steel as a cyclical, unglamorous industry, he believes investors look more favorably on it than they did five years ago.  Still, the industry must do more.  \"My big fear is people thinking that the job is done.  This isn't the time to get complacent,\" he said. \n\n  Williams said prices seem to have stabilized and are on the upswing as steelmakers try to pass on higher raw material and operating expenses, including labor costs associated with a four-year contract negotiated last year with United Steelworkers of America.  Bethlehem and other major steelmakers have upped the cost of key cold and hot rolled sheet effective with July 1 shipments. \n\n  \"I think we've sort of hit the bottom in pricing,\" he said. \n\n  One potentially huge market for steelmakers is rebuilding the country's long-neglected infrastructure.  Williams believes that improvements to the country's bridges, roads, airports, sewers and industrial plants are not only inevitable, but imperative for America to remain competitive. The problem is financing. \n\n  \"I'm saying it's necessary and we need to find a way to do it,\" he said.  Some large industrial companies are already taking steps.  Williams noted that a large unnamed plate fabricator is booked through 1990 with orders to build tanks for a chemical company whose storage facilities had not been updated for years. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 05, 1990 12:17 ET (16:17 GMT)\n",

German Metalworkers Agree To More Pay, Fewer Work Hours\n\n \n\n  EAST BERLIN -AP- A metalworkers union that held a series of strikes in the past few weeks reached an agreement with East German factories that raises their salaries and shortens their working hours. \n\n  After a 47-hour negotiation session, the IG Metall reached an agreement on wages and working conditions early today, the East German news agency ADN reported.  According to the terms of the accord, workers will receive a pay raise of 250 Deutsche marks per month retroactive to July 1 and their work week will be reduced from the current 43 hours to 40 hours at the latest by October.  The union had requested 400 marks per month more. \n\n  East German metal workers earn about 1,200 marks per month, or about a third of what their West German counterparts earn. \n\n  Layoffs will be made effective only after June 30, 1991, ADN reported, and workers dismissed before that point will receive 80 pc to 90 pc of their current wages and reduced time pay.  They will also be entitled to retraining benefits. \n\n  Annual vacations were set at a minimum of 20 days, or four weeks. \n\n  The head of the employers' group in the negotiations, Lothar Heinzmann, said that the agreement was \"by itself economically not justifiable,\" according to ADN.

         "Pioneer Hi-Bred Expects To Report Record Fiscal 3Q Earns\n\n \n   By Scott Kilman \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  DES MOINES, Iowa -DJ- Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. expects to report tomorrow that it generated record fiscal third quarter earnings and that its closely watched market share of North American corn seed sales probably rose for the first time in three years, Thomas N. Urban, chairman and president, told Dow Jones. \n\n  The projection indicates, however, that net income for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31 will probably slip. \n\n  The record net income for the third quarter will be partially offset by a record loss for the first six months of the year. What's more, the results for the 1989 fiscal year include a gain on the sale of an equity interest in an animal vaccine business. \n\n  Pioneer, the nation's largest agricultural seed concern, believes that it controls about 35.5% of corn seed sold in North America, up about 1.3 percentage points from the 1989 planting season, Urban said. Corn is the biggest U.S.  crop. \n\n  Pioneer's market share increased amid less-than-expected sales gains for the U.S. seed industry. An unusually wet spring delayed many farmers from planting corn for so long that they switched to other crops or abandoned their fields. \n\n  Urban wouldn't disclose how much Pioneer's North American corn seed sales increased in the 1990 planting season other than to say sales \"are up significantly.\" \n\n  According to industry analysts and competitors, Pioneer did everything from cut prices to give away free bags of seed in order to stop the erosion of its market share. \n\n  Urban, however, said the market share rebound was the pay off from the company's reorganization of its sales force three years ago. \"I think we are better sales people,\" he said. \n\n  A slightly higher-than-normal amount of seed was given to farmers as free samples because the company introduced a large number of new hybrid seed products, he said. \n\n  Pioneer's sales strategy is increasingly based on introducing a large number of new hybrids. This year, the company offered 22 new hybrids to farmers. Another 17 new hybrids are being grown by the company for sale next year. \n\n  \"We are into a new era,\" Pioneer Chairman Urban said. \"We will be introducing new hybrids at a rapid pace on a regular basis.\" \n\n  Urban wouldn't predict the earnings for the third quarter ended May 31 that the company expects to report Friday. \n\n  Wall Street estimates that the company will report fiscal third quarter net income from continuing operations per share of between $4.54 and $4.70 \"isn't a bad range,\" Urban said. \"It will be the best third quarter we have ever had.\" \n\n  In the same 1989 quarter, Pioneer reported income from continuing operations of $114.6 million, or $3.59 a share, on sales of $608.1 million.  Income from discontinued operations of $605,000 made final net income $115.2 million, or $3.61 a share. \n\n  Much of Pioneer's business is generated in the fiscal third quarter, which is when most of its customers pay for the seed they ordered for spring planting. Some other seed companies record their sales earlier in the season when they deliver seed to their dealers. \n\n  Despite a record third quarter, the company's results for the full year ending Aug. 31 will be held back by a loss of $51.8 million, or $1.66 a share, generated during the first six months of the fiscal year. \n\n  At the same time, the company's 1989 results were inflated by a gain from the sale of its equity interest in a vaccine maker. The sale of the interest in the Agrion operation contributed 27 cents a share to the company's net income from continuing operations of $81.9 million, or $2.58 a share. Income from discontinued operations of $16.3 million made final net income $98.2 million, or $3.09 a share, for fiscal 1989. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 12, 1990 14:51 ET (18:51 GMT)\n",

         "June Consumption Rebound Bodes Well For 3rd Qtr GNP\n\n \n   By Laurence Bauman \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- The rise in June personal consumption expenditures is seen as a sign that consumer spending may be on the rebound, following an exceptionally weak second quarter. \n\n  Personal consumption expenditures in June rose 1%, compared with unchanged expenditures in May and a 0.2% increase in April, the Commerce Department reported.  The monthly PCE data are not adjusted for inflation. \n\n  The second quarter gross national product report showed that PCE declined at an annual rate of about 0.3% in the period, on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n\n  \"The pattern of consumption suggests that spending on durables and services in June were moderately stronger than in April and May,\" says Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. \n\n  \"The weakness was concentrated in April and May, while in June there was a little bounceback,\" adds Platt.  \"That suggest that consumption won't be a drag in the third quarter, although it does not suggest any robustness.\" \n\n  The rise in June PCE \"provides a decent ramp into the third quarter,\" says James Fralick, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.  \"If the trend can be maintained, we should get some decent growth\" in the third quarter. \n\n  Personal income in June was up 0.4%, following 0.3% increases in both April and May. \n\n  The key wages and salery component of income was up 0.5% in month, compared with May's 0.4% rise. \n\n  Fralick terms the increase in personal income as \"a normal kind of growth.\" \n\n  But Platt says that the recent weakness seen in the monthly payroll data suggest that \"the income side will be rather sluggish, and, in a few months, will contribute to another downturn in consumption.\" \n\n  He says that currently, a major reason consumer spending is weak is that \"prices are too high.  Store owners are experiencing consumer resistance,\" and will eventually have to cut prices in order to clear off their shelves. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 30, 1990 12:47 ET (16:47 GMT)\n",

         "Analysts - Bank Of Canada Rate -2-\n\n \n\n  Burns Fry Ltd. said recent signs of a softening economy and improving inflation justify the recent drop in the bank rate and \"makes the case for further declines.\"  It noted that the M2 monetary aggregate, the money supply figure most closely watched by the central bank, grew at an annual rate of 4.9 pc in the six months ended in June compared to a rate of 17 pc in January.  M2 includes currency and net demand deposits plus personal savings deposits and non-personal notice deposits. \n\n  Burns Fry said demand for household credit, which grew at a rate of 14.5 pc in June, and some generous wage settlements reduced the prospects for significant interest rate declines. \n\n  \"The strong dollar, weaker growth and the more favorable tone in the U.S.  money markets give the Bank of Canada the flexibility to shift to a more accommodative policy stance,\" said Bank of Nova Scotia economist David Rosenberg.  The central bank, however, is likely to resist any sharp declines in short-term rates because of its continuing concern with high wage gains.  \"The central bank remains concerned that the run-up in wage settlements will reverse the recent moderation in consumer price trends,\" Rosenberg said. \n\n  Gerard MacDonell, a Royal Bank of Canada economist, said the dollar, which was pushed higher last week because of declines in U.S. short-term interest rates, may come under some selling pressure tomorrow after Statistics Canada reports its survey of revised capital spending intentions for 1990.  MacDonell said that, while financial markets are expecting the Canadian dollar to reach 87c (U.S.), a weak spending intentions report could \"damage the Canadian dollar by provoking speculation of a rapid cut in Canadian short-term interest rates.\" \n\n  Michael Gregory, another Royal Bank economist, predicted that the revised capital spending intentions figure would be down significantly from the 7.4-pc increase forecast in the March survey.  Gregory said a strong Canadian dollar, declining profitability and lower equity prices and capacity utilization rates indicate the revised investment figure will show about a 2-pc increase. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 25, 1990 15:40 ET (19:40 GMT)\n",

         "CPI Data Show Inflation Ignoring Recession Talk\n\n \n   By Kevin Donovan \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- Inflation hasn't gotten the word about the tottering economy. \n\n  The consumer price index in July rose 0.4%, the Labor Department reported this morning. The CPI component excluding food and energy, the so-called core rate of inflation, was up an alarming 0.6% in the month. \n\n  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists had looked for a 0.3% rise in the CPI and for a similar rise without the food and energy components. \n\n  Inflation reports in the next few months are likely to show sizable increases because of the rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \n\n  Labor said the July CPI report didn't reflect the impact of the Mideast crisis. In fact, consumer energy prices were down 0.7% in July. \n\n  \"It underscores the fact inflation is not going to vanish meekly from the scene despite all the clamor about a soft economy,\" says Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. \n\n  Roach says his calculations show core inflation up at a 5.9% annual rate through the first seven months of 1990, compared with a 4.7% rate for the first seven months in 1989. \n\n  \"The sharp rise in core inflation reflects an economy that is clearly sending some ominous signals ... even before we deal with a full-blown energy crisis,\" he says. \n\n  John Williams, economist at Bankers Trust Co., says, \"The way to explain it, is it's alarming.\" \n\n  \"When you consider that energy prices were down in this report and when you consider that's not likely to happen again soon, the prospects for inflation are not very rosy at the moment,\" Williams says. \n\n  The consumer price index for July continues to show the difficulty in reining in medical costs, which are more or less impervious to supply and demand forces. \n\n  Medical costs showed the sharpest rise among major CPI components in July, leaping 0.9% after rising 0.7% in June and 0.8% in May. \n\n  \"We've got to find a way to get a handle on medical costs,\" says Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. \n\n  Stone says much of the increase in the July CPI may be the result of higher local taxes, and thus may represent a one-time surge in the inflation rate. \n\n  \"It looks like some sales tax increases got to us in here, so that many of these items suffered a one-shot surge in prices,\" she says. \"The surge in tobacco prices is a case in point.\" \n\n  Tobacco-price increases due to tax hikes accounted for a large part of the increase in the \"other\" category of CPI. Tobacco prices, which were up 2.7% in July, account for about 1.5% of the CPI index. \n\n  In addition, new hotel room taxes may have accounted for the rise in \"other renters' costs\" that helped boost the housing category 0.5% in July, Stone says. \n\n  Noting that apparel prices and automobile prices fell in the month, she says the overall CPI increase was \"sharp but it wasn't pervasive.\" \n\n  Nevertheless, \"inflation is jumping to center stage,\" says Morgan Stanley's Roach. \n\n  He says CPI inflation surged in the first quarter of 1990, followed by a \"breathing spell\" in the seocnd quarter.  Now it may be heating up again. \n\n  The confluence of the Persian Gulf crisis and a robust inflation reading could well freeze monetary policy, says Bankers Trust's Williams. \n\n  \"The markets know that the Fed is as uncertain about the future as the rest of us are,\" he says, and would probably deem any bold move in changing policy foolish. \n\n  \"Don't just do something, sit there,\" might be the Fed's only choice, he says. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 16, 1990 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\n",

         "Oil Company Stocks Lower -2-\n\n \n\n  Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.  analyst Michael Young tells Dow Jones Professional Investor Report oil prices above $30 a barrel are counterproductive both to the oil stocks prospects and the broader market as well. \n\n  On the morning call today to clients and brokers, Young said it was time to take profits in the oil patch.  \"Oil stocks can't continue to go up if the market continues to go down,\" he said. \n\n  In particular, Young downgraded British Petroleum Co.  to \"hold\" from \"buy\" on a price basis, noting the stock is up 27% in the third quarter alone. \n\n  Smith Barney also removed Amerada Hess Corp. and Amoco Corp. from its Investment Policy Committe buy list. \n\n  At current prices, both companies are showing relatively weaker dividend yields, says Young.  Amerada Hess's closing price yesterday gives a 1.2% yield versus 3.2% for the domestic oil companies, and Amoco's 3.5% yield compares unfavorably with a 4.5% average yield for the major oils, he says. \n\n  Young adds that if $30-a-barrel oil were here to stay, it doesn't have positive implications for oil demand growth. It would foster alternative energy demand, particularly natural gas, he says. \n\n  The Smith Barney analyst sees oil prices remaining above their levels of six weeks ago but dropping back to the low twenties in the event of a diplomatic or peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis. \n\n  Should the stalemate continue, Young expects oil prices will stabilize at about $28 a barrel, but hit $40 a barrel in the event of war. \n\n  First Boston analyst William Randol, however, is bullish on the oil stocks both short and long term, based on his belief that things \"are going to get ugly\" in the Middle East. \n\n  Randol says he's recommending clients aggressively purchase the major oils, both for the short and long term. \n\n  There could be a 3 million-barrel-a-day crude oil shortage in the fourth quarter, with the crude oil winter needs rising to 24.5 million barrels daily from the current 21.5 million, he says. \n\n  With Saudi Arabia and Venezuela struggling to make up for the oil that used to come from Iraq and Kuwait, he wonders where the oil is going to come from. \n\n  Kidder Peabody & Co. analyst William Brown tells Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the broader market decline is hurting the oil stocks today. \n\n  \"People are just afraid of everything right now,\" and the oil stocks have no immunity to it today, he says. \n\n  However, Brown told Kidder, Peabody's sale force and clients this morning to remain overweighted in oil stocks and not give in to the selling pressure. \n\n  Though OPEC is trying to raise production, a major correction in oil prices - barring a diplomatic or peaceful breakthrough in the Middle East - isn't foreseen, he said. \n\n  Even if Saudi Arabia and Venezuela pick up the Iraq-Kuwait slack in oil production, there will still be a shortfall of some 500,000 barrels a day from the pre-invasion production levels, Brown estimates. \n\n  While there may be a \"pause\" in the oil stocks' stellar absolute performance of recent weeks, Brown expects oil stocks to continue to outperform the broader market on a relative basis. \n\n  The analyst says the following companies are particularly leveraged to the price of oil when compared to competitors: Royal Dutch Petroleum, Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum, and Amoco Corp. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 23, 1990 13:21 ET (17:21 GMT)\n",

         "Bundesbank Official Says Dollar Drop Should Be Gradual\n\n \n\n  FRANKFURT -DJ- The dollar's decline in currency markets should be more gradual than the sharp drop registered thus far this week, said Claus Koehler, a Bundesbank director. \n\n  \"The tempo has been disturbed and that could mean a upward correction is possible.  A more gradual dollar decline would be better,\" Koehler told journalists. \n\n  Koehler noted that the fundamental attractiveness in the Deutsche mark, which has been soaring against the dollar, lies in the lower inflation rate in West Germany than in other countries, including the U.S. \n\n  West German inflation currently is running at around an annual rate of 2.3 pc, about half of the U.S level. \n\n  Koehler said the inflation difference should be seen as a more important indicator of the mark's underlying firmness against the dollar than interest rate differentials. \n\n  Koehler also noted that at the moment the markets are weighing the \"success\" of the German monetary union against the ongoing crisis in the U.S.  savings and loan industry. \n\n  Koehler also said he doesn't see any destabilizing influence on the European Monetary System from the German unification and the transfer of resources from West to East Germany. \n\n  He said the recent record high current account surpluses being posted by West Germany almost certainly will be cut back in the future as the Germanys boost imports as part of the reconstruction of the East German economy. \n\n  Koehler also strongly rejected the proposal made several weeks ago by Great Britain to establish a hard pan-European currency as a parallel to existing monetary units in the European Community.  \"We absolutely don't subscribe to the idea of a parallel currency. Who would regulate it.  It would only create new problems,\" Koehler remarked. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 01, 1990 09:19 ET (13:19 GMT)\n",

         "Aug Sales, PPI Data Seen Giving Fed Room To Ease\n\n \n   By Laurence Bauman and Kevin Donovan \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporters \n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- The decline in August retail sales and the moderate increase in the core rate of producer price inflation are seen increasing the chances of an easing of monetary policy. \n\n  As expected, the rise in oil prices distorted both reports.  But the increase in energy costs is a factor well beyond the control of Fed policy makers, and so analysts say the data will be viewed in terms of their underlying trends, which reflect weak economic activity and moderate inflation. \n\n  Retail sales in August were down 0.6 pc, compared with an 0.4 pc increase in the previous month. But August gasoline station sales, sparked by a rise in gas prices, rose 6.4 pc, without which retail sales were down 1.1 pc. \n\n  The producer price index was up 1.3 pc in August, in line with market expectations.  Without food and energy prices, PPI was up 0.3 pc in August. \n\n  If the Federal Reserve is poised to ease monetary policy, the two economic reports will leave them \"that much more inclined,\" says Raymond Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. \n\n  The 1.3 pc increase in the overall PPI \"is not good news, but the PPI is not as bad as it could have been,\" when food and energy costs are factored out, and \"retail sales were clearly weak,\" says Stone. \n\n  The retail sales report \"was a pretty weak number, and the Fed should probably respond to the weakness in the economy,\" says Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. \n\n  He says the Fed \"is close to easing,\" but is probably waiting for a budget agreement before pushing short-term rates lower. \n\n  The bond market is lower on the day, but the losses reflect overnight declines on Mideast concerns. Bond prices are little changed since the PPI and retail sales reports at 8:30 a.m.  EDT. \n\n  The Treasury's 8 3/4 pc 30-year bellwether bond is down 10/32 from Tuesday's close at 97 13/32 to yield 8.99 pc, while Treasury bill rates are down one basis point. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 14, 1990 09:50 ET (13:50 GMT)\n",

         "Haussmann Says High Oil Price To Cut German Growth Slightly\n\n \n\n  BONN -DJ- Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann played down the negative impact higher oil prices could have on West German economic growth, but said a rend toward higher monthly price increases could accelerate in September. \n\n  Haussmann said in a statement that, if oil prices remain at $25 to $28 a barrel, \"this would for the rest of the year mean a reduction in growth of a few tenths of a percentage point.\" \n\n  The West German economy is expected to grow about 4 pc in 1990, after a similar rate of expansion in 1989. \n\n  Haussmann predicted a more apparent effect on consumer prices, which he said were already boosted \"noticeably\" by higher energy prices in August.  The preliminary cost of living rose 2.9 pc from a year earlier in August, up from a July year-to-year rise of only 2.4 pc. \n\n  In September, Haussmann said, \"this trend will continue under the current circumstances.\" \n\n  The economics minister also said West Germany's trade balance will be affected by the rise in oil prices.  But he added that, with West Germany's continued high trade and current account surpluses, a rise in the nation's oil import bill would be manageable without the need for any offsetting action. \n\n  The Federal Statistics Office reported earlier this week that Europe's largest economy grew an inflation-adjusted 3.9 pc in first half compared with a year earlier. \n\n  The strength of the D-mark, which cuts the dollar-denominated price of oil for West Germany, is also a positive factor, Haussmann said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 07, 1990 07:34 ET (11:34 GMT)\n",

Instead, union and company representatives met to resolve the impasse at the Superior Labor Court in Brasilia, the capital. \n\n  Strikers demanded a raise of 279 pc to offset losses from inflation, which was 4,274 pc in the past 12 months. \n\n  The labor court proposed a 104 pc increase, which unions were inclined to accept, court spokesman Cesar Borges said. \n\n  Petrobras refused to budge from 98 pc but agreed to re-examine the case of employees punished for political motives. \n\n  The company's position was strengthened by the decision of five unions earlier in the week to accept the 98 pc.  The unions included Brazil's two largest oil refineries, in Campinas and Duque de Caxias. \n\n  Unions in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Minas Gerais met late yesterday and voted to take Petrobras' offer. \n\n  Brazil produces about 60 pc of the 1.1 million barrels of oil it consumes daily. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 13, 1990 16:25 ET (20:25 GMT)\n",

However, a big exception is the Sentra, completely redone for this year.  It will start at $7,999, a $600 or 8.1% increase from the current model. \n\n  Nissan's car and truck sales in the U.S. dropped 4.9% through July 31, making it the only major Japanese auto maker to lose market share this year.  Overall, Japanese car makers took a record 28% of the U.S.  car market in the first half of 1990. \n\n  Nissan released prices on all of its models except for the upscale Maxima. The base price of the 1991 Nissan Stanza will be $11,900, a 2.1% increase from 1990. The Nissan 240SX will start at $13,609, a 2.7% rise. \n\n  Nissan lowered the base price of its 300ZX sports car to $27,300 from $28,600, a decrease of 4.5%.

         "Schlesinger Says West Should Avoid Easy Credit To E Europe\n\n \n\n  LONDON -DJ- Western industrialized nations should avoid \"easy credit\" to Eastern Europe and focus on maintaining currency stability to help the region's shift toward market-based economies, Deutsche Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said. \n\n  Schlesinger, speaking at a London conference on global monetary developments and policy, added that Western industrialized nations must also \"create the preconditions for a non-inflationary transfer of resources to the countries of Eastern Europe in the next few years\" by eliminating interest rate subsidies, liberalizing financial markets and by opening markets generally to free trade. \n\n  \"A policy of easy money in the industrial countries would be of no assistance to the capital-importing countries\" of Eastern Europe since that would only serve to fuel inflation, he said. \n\n  Schlesinger said easy credit \"would push up interest rates and ultimately also lead to higher real interest rates which would be undesirable with respect to a steady growth of the economy.\" \n\n  The Bundesbank official stressed industrial nations could most help reforms in Eastern Europe by maintaining \"the stability of those currencies which the Eastern European countries use for their international transactions.\" \n\n  \"International monetary policy can contribute indirectly to promoting the transfer of resources by working toward as stable a monetary environment as possible so as to make sure that exchange rate risks remain small and distortions of the competitive position due to monetary developments are avoided,\" he said. \n\n  \"The be-all and end-all of a stable environment is price stability,\" Schlesinger said. \n\n  Schlesinger reaffirmed the Bundesbank's commitment to currency stability and added that \"Success in the unification process in Germany, while safeguarding monetary stability, is probably in the interests of all our European neighbors, in the East and in the West alike.\" \n\n  Deutsche Bundesbank Vice Chairman Schlesinger said he doesn't \"see any danger for a devaluation of the d-mark in the future,\" although he also declined to elaborate on exactly what time frame was involved. \n\n  He did, however, note that current estimates indicated growth next year will be somewhere between 3 pc and 3.5 pc, including the impact of higher world oil prices. \n\n  As well, with chances for steady interest rates the mark is likely to remain robust \"on average\" against the world's major currencies, Schlesinger maintained. \n\n  Inflation, he added, may touch 3 pc in the near term from current levels around 2.8 pc to 2.9 pc.  But the Bundesbank official stressed that tight monetary policies would remain intact and that he didn't envision German inflation growing much. \n\n  With the cost of German unification expected to mount, Schlesinger added tax increases would be \"a last resort.\" But he noted that the government is also weighing cuts in expenditures, particularly those designed as subsidies. \n\n  And while \"presumably this is not enough,\" another option to offset the costs of financing economic reforms in East Germany is also capital market borrowing, he said. \n\n  On Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, Schlesinger was cautious, saying that \"It's not really the position of the Bundesbank to decide on sterling and the ERM.  It is a question on when the U.K. can come in.  But the U.K.  has to decide when.\" \n\n  Sterling fell sharply last Friday on reports that Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl suggested Britain shouldn't enter given its high inflation rate. \n\n  Schlesinger rejected that suggestion. But he said the ERM timing for the pound \"is complicated.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 27, 1990 10:11 ET (14:11 GMT)\n",

         "Shell Canada Earnings -2-\n\n \n\n  The company said oil products earnings increased to C$69 million from C$10 million in the third quarter due to higher sales volumes and firmer sales margins resulting from stable retail market conditions and improved refinery operations. Resources earnings were C$33 million for the third quarter, compared with a loss of C$7 million a year earlier.  The improvement was the result of higher sales prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids due to recent events in the Persian Gulf, higher sales volumes for all products, in particular natural gas and natural gas liquids, and lower exploration expenses. Chemicals earnings improved to C$16 million from C$10 million, primarily due to higher styrene margins. \n\n  Resources performance is expected to remain strong for the rest of the year if current crude oil prices are sustained. \n\n  Capital and exploration spending in the nine months fell to C$415 million from C$537 million. It said resource spending was lower than anticipated due to delays in the commencement of Caroline development.  Oil Products spending of C$94 million included C$58 million for improvements to the retail network and C$36 million for manufacturing projects. \n\n  The company, which issued C$150 million of debt earlier this month for general corporate purposes, said further funding may be needed before year-end for working capital requirements if crude oil prices remain at current levels. \n\n  Corporate expenses were C$55 million for the nine months, up from C$20 million a year earlier. It said expenses increased as a result of the second-quarter pre-tax provision of C$45 million for the costs of restructuring. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 23, 1990 16:29 ET (20:29 GMT)\n",

         "U.S. Producer Price Index Rose 1.6% In September\n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON -DJ- U.S.  producer prices of finished goods rose a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in September, or at a 20.9% compounded annual rate, the Labor Department said. \n\n  The latest increase compared with a rise of an adjusted 1.3%, or 16.4% at a compounded annual rate, in August and a fall of 0.1%, or 1.0% at a compounded annual rate, in July. \n\n  So far in calendar 1990, the PPI has risen at a 6.3% compounded annual rate. \n\n  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report survey of 17 economists published Wednesday found an average estimate of a 1.3% rise in September producer prices. \n\n  The producer price index for finished goods showed that prices of consumer foods fell an adjusted 0.9% last month after rising an adjusted 0.8% in July. \n\n  Last month's PPI, less the volatile food and energy components, increased an adjusted 0.6% after rising 0.3% the month before. Capital equipment costs rose an adjusted 0.8% after rising 0.3%. \n\n  Energy prices rose 13.8% in September, compared with a 9.5% rise the prior month. \n\n  Before seasonal adjustment, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose 0.9% last month to 120.3% of the 1982 average and stood 5.9% ahead of the index reading a year earlier. \n\n  The PPI for intermediate goods, which have had some processing, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.8% last month after increasing an adjusted 1.3% in the preceding month. Before seasonal adjustment, this index rose 1.7% and stood at 116.3% of its 1982 average, up 3.5% from a year earlier. \n\n  The PPI for crude goods rose a seasonally adjusted 4.6% last month after increasing an adjusted 9.3% in the preceding month. Before seasonal adjustment, this index rose 4.4% and stood at 115.1% of its 1982 average, up 12.5% from a year earlier. \n\n  The 13.8% increase in September energy prices is the largest recorded since the Labor Department began tracking producer prices, a Labor official said. The second largest monthly increase occurred in January, when energy prices moved up 13.7%. \n\n  As reported, both the gasoline and home heating oil indexes climbed more than 20% in September. In addition, the index for natural gas increased 1.3% after falling 9.4% in August, Labor said. \n\n  Food prices, meanwhile, moved down 0.9% after increasing 0.8% in August.  Prices fell in September for beef and veal, eggs, fresh vegetables, shortening and pasta.  Prices for dairy products and pork also fell in September, Labor said. \n\n  As reported in the intermediate goods category, prices rose 1.8% in September following a 1.3% increase in August. As was the case in August, the energy component contributed to much of the increase. \n\n  Nondurable manufacturing materials, for example, jumped 2.0% in September after rising 0.1% in August.  The acceleration was dominated by a strong increase in petrochemical prices, Labor said. \n\n  The index for crude goods, meanwhile, increased 4.6% in September after a 9.3% rise in August. The increase in prices for crude energy materials slowed to 12.4% following a 25.5% increase in August. Crude petroleum prices moved up 20.4%, down considerably from the 62.5% increase in August, Labor said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 12, 1990 08:30 ET (12:30 GMT)\n",

         "Mieno Says Dollar Is Falling Too Quickly Against The Yen\n\n \n\n  TOKYO -DJ- Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said the dollar is falling too quickly against the yen, despite basic factors in the market that appear to support the currency. \n\n  Mieno, speaking at a regularly scheduled press conference, wouldn't name an appropriate level for the dollar and noted that the market is still striving to adjust to the fight over the U.S. budget and weakening business conditions in the U.S. \n\n  Failure by the U.S. Congress to agree on a tentative plan to cut the fiscal deficit and increasingly gloomy economic statistics are behind the dollar's recent decline, Mieno said. \n\n  But he added that the market apparently doesn't think it will be dominated by dollar selling because of U.S. efforts to cut the deficit, the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary stance and uncertainties surrounding the Persian Gulf situation.  Nonetheless, traders are pushing the currency down a bit too quickly, he asserted. \n\n  Mieno said that the stronger yen lessens inflationary pressures within the Japanese economy.  But the economy's tendency toward inflation still requires vigilance on the part of the Bank of Japan. Currently, the central bank doesn't intend to change its monetary policy and is watching the effects of the last discount rate rise on Aug. 30. \n\n  Mieno observed that Tokyo stock prices have recovered slightly since the Ministry of Finance announced measures Oct.  1 to support the market.  He repeated his position that a central bank governor shouldn't comment on the appropriate level for stock prices. \n\n  But while Mieno was unwilling to discuss particular levels of stock prices, he said that in any market they should stabilize at a range that reflects the prospects for growth in the economy. \n\n  Touching on the Ministry of Finance's measures to support the market, Mieno said that comments by Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the beginning of the month reflected the general need to support the stock market rather than initiatives in monetary policy. \n\n  Hashimoto said Oct. 1 that monetary policy should be directed to stabilize the market, remarks that led some to speculate of a clash between the Bank of Japan and the ministry over formation of policy. \n\n  Mieno said that, though the drop in the stock market made it more difficult for Japanese banks to meet Bank for International Settlement (BIS) requirements, the BIS requirements aren't just a number to be reached but are meant to make banks financially sound. \n\n  He said even though the stock market has dropped, banks still have enough time to meet the BIS standards before the March 1993 deadline. By then, banks must have capital equal to 8 pc of their risk-weighted assets, although by March of next year, the interim ratio must be 7.25 pc. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 11, 1990 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\n",

This compares with August's revised 1.0% monthly rise and 0.8% yearly fall. The adjusted August data was previously reported as an 0.9% monthly rise and a 1.0% yearly fall. \n\n  The office noted that seasonally adjusted input prices registered their highest month-on-month increase since October 1976 when the monthly rise amounted to 3.3%. \n\n  After seasonal adjustment, the index of input prices was at 105.4 in September, up from a revised 103.1 in August and up from 105.1 in September 1989.
