You will be given a news narrative talking about inflation and potentially the cause.
A narrative consists of a sequence of events (fabula) and the telling of them (discourse).
In this context, a narrative is represented by a causal graph (DAG) between events.
An important note here is that for each news narrative, there is a core idea that the narrator wants to deliver to the readers.
This core idea consists of a sequence of core events, distinguished from supplementary events, whose removal does not influence the delivery of the core idea.
Your task will be to identify the core events from the given narrative, mark the text span with "<core_event>...</core_event>" to highlight what you consider as the core events.
For example:
The foundation of <core_event>the 37-year-old's extraordinary career</core_event> was formed by <core_event>an incredible work ethic</core_event> that never saw him skipping a day of training.
