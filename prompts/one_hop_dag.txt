You will be provided with an article with the word 'inflation' mentioned, delimited by the <text></text> xml tags.
The article was published in Dow Jones Newswires, with the datetime information is provided in the last <p></p> tag.
Since the article is real-world media's narratives mentioning inflation, it can be a news describing what causes inflation, or it can be a news barely mentioning the string 'inflation'.
Your task is to
(A) identify whether this article is describing the causes of inflation [YES or NO],
and if YES,
(B) indicate the causal relations between any mentioned events in the article and inflation, where mentioned events can be further categorized into three broader factors (Demand, supply and miscellaneous) as in the following tables:

Factor 1: Demand
Event type|Explanation|Example
Government spending|Increases in government spending (e.g., stimulus payments).|“[...] Stimulus checks were given to all middle income families; A second round of stimulus checks were also given to all families by the new administration [...]”
Monetary policy|Loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.|“[...] The Federal Reserve increasing the amount of money in the economy [...]”
Pent-up demand|Reopening of the economy and the associated higher incomes, new spending opportunities, and optimism about the future.|“[...] now that the lockdowns have ended, the demand is there and more people are trying to get their lives back to normal.”
Demand shift|Shift of demand across sectors (particularly increases in durables).|“[...] Shifts in what people are buying due to the pandemic - more goods, especially durables, fewer services. [...]” (taken from the expert sample)
Demand (residual)|Increase in demand that cannot be attributed to the other demand channels.|“That people are buying a lot more products [...]”

Factor 2: Supply
Event type|Explanation|Example
Supply chain issues|Disruption of global supply chains.|“[...] containers sitting at docks waiting for pick up [...]”
Labor shortage|Shortage of workers, e.g., due to some workers dropping out of the labor force, and higher wage costs.|“[...] People are less motivated to work currently, causing businesses to hike up rates, and offer a higher wage to attract employees. [...]”
Energy crisis|The global energy crisis, leading to shortages of, e.g., oil and natural gas and higher energy prices.|“I think the rising cost of gas has caused the inflation rate to rise on other products. [...]”
Supply (residual)|Negative supply effects other than labor shortage, supply chain issues, energy crisis.|“[...] less production in goods [...]” “[...] business shutdowns [...]”

Factor 3: Miscellaneous
Event type|Explanation|Example
Pandemic|The COVID-19 pandemic, the global pandemic recession, lockdowns, and other policy measures.|“The pandemic was the beginning factor, it caused the economy to shut down and thus caused the beginning of inflation. [...]”
Government mismanagement|Policy failure, mismanagement by policymakers, policymakers are blamed|“I think Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are at fault for the inflation increasing so rapidly. [...]”
Russia-Ukraine war|The Russian invasion of Ukraine, the international economic, political, and military response.|“[...] the war in Ukraine has a lot to do with the inflation rate as well because of the sanctions with Russia. [...]” (taken from March 2022 household sample)
Inflation expectations|Expectations about high inflation in the coming years, making firms preemptively increase prices and workers bargain for higher wages.|“[...] Producers may raise prices to cover the expected increase in wages for workers willing to meet the rising cost of living [...]”
Base effect|Mentions that inflation is high due to a base effect, i.e., a very low inflation rate during the pandemic, leading almost mechanically to high inflation rates now.|“The first reason inflation is as high as 6.2% at an annual rate is a base effect due to low levels of inflation during the COVID-19 crisis [...]” (taken from the expert sample)
Government debt||High level of government debt.|“[...] With the debt as high as it is, the only recourse is for inflation increase. [...]”
Tax increases|Tax increases, such as VAT hikes.|“[...] Our prices rise because of the tax increase.”
Price-gouging|Greedy companies exploit opportunities to increase profits. Companies are trying to make up for the money they lost during the pandemic.|“I think that companies used the Covid pandemic to increase their profits so they could make up for lost profit during the shut down. [...]”


Your response (delimited by <answer></answer>) should analyze the article by identifying
(1) events mentioned in the article,
(2) categorizing event mentions into event type as well as the three factors provided above (consider the explanation and example),
(3) identifying the causal relations between events and inflation. For example, given the following news article,

<text>
<pre>
 </pre>
<p>
  TORONTO -DJ- Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (T.CM) said its Leading Indicator of Economic Activity rose 0.1% in October, &quot;continuing a trend of slow growth.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The bank said the Canadian economy has been improving steadily over the past few months, with export growth being accompanied by stronger domestic demand. Providing it isn&apos;t derailed by a hike in taxes, the recovery is likely to accelerate through 1994, the bank added. </p>
<p>
  The bank said the inflation indicator rose by 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in October, its ninth consecutive increase. Although consumer inflation is currently low, recent increases in the price of imports and of natural gas are creating some price pressure. </p>
<p>
  The inflation rate is expected to average about 2.3% in 1994, up from 1.8% in 1993. </p>
<p>
  Canadian Imperial Bank said that, of the seven components which comprise the Economic Indicator, five rose and two fell in October. </p>
<p>
  It said the U.S. leading indicator and the stock price index were both up 0.5%. The strongest decline was in the yield curve component, which fell 0.7%,the bank added. </p>

Your answer will be:
<answer>
<A>YES</A>
<B><EventsLeadingToInflation>
    <event>
        <mention>Increase in the price of imports</mention>
        <event type>Supply chain issues</event type>
        <factor>Supply</factor>
    </event>
    <event>
        <mention>Increase in the price of natural gas</mention>
        <event type>Energy crisis</event type>
        <factor>Supply</factor>
    </event>
</EventsLeadingToInflation></B>
</answer>

ensuring the correctness of the ultimate conclusion,
which should accurately reflect the likely causal connection
between identified events and inflation, based on the information
presented in the text. If no clear causal relationship is apparent,
select the appropriate option accordingly (e.g. <answer>
<A>NO</A>
<B></B>
</answer>).
