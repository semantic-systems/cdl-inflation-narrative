In fact, he handed it to Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez last Friday, the Central Bank official confirmed. \n\n  In his short tenure, Rossi also reportedly lost favor with his own Union of the Democratic Center political party when the Central Bank printed 1 trillion australs this month, an amount that almost doubled the money supply. \n\n  That monetary expansion, which Rossi had pledged to quell, almost certainly will fuel inflation, which soared by 40% in December and is projected to increase by at least that much this month. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 22, 1990 11:37 ET (16:37 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.858666Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-19T15:44:08.999354Z", "inner_id": 1, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5370, "annotations": [{"id": 4942, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "dhaw7oZ2J7", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-19T20:09:02.625297Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-19T20:09:02.625311Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 16.905, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "be1ddba4-bd6a-427d-8aa3-51f0d555ef2d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5370, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Shell Oil Co. 4th Qtr Net $264 Mln Vs $212 Mln\n\n \n\n  4th Quar: \n\n  1989 1988 \n\n   Revenues        $5,505,000,000 $5,458,000,000 \n   Net income         264,000,000 212,000,000 \n\n  Shr ern: \n\n   Net income               ....  .... \n\n  Year: \n\n   Revenues        21,948,000,000 21,399,000,000 \n   Net income       1,405,000,000 1,239,000,000 \n\n  Shr ern: \n\n   Net income               ....  .... \n\n  No per-share figures were provided; the company is a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Group. \n\n  Shell Oil Co. said its year-ago full year net of $1,239,000,000 includes a gain of $35 million from an accounting change. \n\n  -0- \n\n  The oil company attributed its good performance to a strong showing by its oil-producing sector, which was buoyed by higher oil prices, and the chemicals business, which reported record income.

Still, he said, \"the direction and magnitude of recent changes are clear consequences of the U.S.'s current account deficits.\" \n\n  He said growing U.S. net international indebtedness and the U.S.'s large current account deficits are two sides of the same coin. \n\n  He said that \"the most important underlying cause of the surge in our net borrowing from foreigners and the deterioration in our external balance has been the substantial decline in our national savings rate against the background of a relatively stable investment rate.\" He said the decline in savings reflected in part the expansion of the budget deficit. \n\n  \"The fundamental accounting identity between savings and investment, of course, requires that any shortfall of domestic savings below domestic investment be made up in the form of a net inflow of savings from abroad,\" Greenspan said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 25, 1990 10:36 ET (15:36 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.858766Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-19T20:13:16.735191Z", "inner_id": 3, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5372, "annotations": [{"id": 4944, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "_Hcv7_j9wC", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-19T20:14:07.536783Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-19T20:14:07.536808Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 50.136, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "31a18d3f-2d1c-47ea-86b9-e0fb60fe78b8", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5372, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Bethlehem Steel 4th Qtr Net 58c A Share Vs. 79c\n\n \n\n  4th Quar Dec 31: \n\n  1989 1988 \n\n   Sales          $1,145,100,000 $1,332,200,000 \n   Net income       a 50,000,000 65,700,000 \n\n  Shr earns (primary) \n\n   Net income              0.58 0.79 \n\n  Shr earns (fully diluted) \n\n   Net income              0.57 0.77 \n\n  a.

Currently, there are about 38 million units outstanding. \n\n  Lee said Newhall's total appraised land value exceeded $1 billion for the first time ever at Dec. 31, 1989.  \"It's a reflection of the rising land values in California,\" he said, noting that the trend is expected to continue.  \"Over the last five years, the appraised values have grown at a compound annual rate of 19 pc,\" he added. \n\n  Lee said the residential real estate market has slowed somewhat this year but the company expects 1990 will be a \"very good year\" at its giant industrial parks in Valencia, a rapidly-growing area about 30 miles north of Los Angeles. \n\n  At the company's Valencia Industrial Center, building absorption last year was 1.4 million square feet, up 40 pc from the average of the prior three years. \n\n  About two million square feet remain to be sold and developed at the 1,500-acre industrial center, but at the company's nearby 1,600-acre Valencia Commerce Center, there is room for about 11 million square feet of commercial and industrial buildings. \n\n  \"1990 could be a tremendous year for us,\" Lee said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 13, 1990 12:46 ET (17:46 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.858891Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-19T20:17:02.577032Z", "inner_id": 7, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5376, "annotations": [{"id": 4948, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "0SW28NPt3M", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-19T20:18:13.490707Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-19T20:18:13.490742Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 70.134, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "912b92fb-3724-49b7-899e-90bca0c88749", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5376, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "&apos;Zero Inflation&apos; Seen As Non- Starter Despite Tough Talk\n\n \n   By John Connor \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  WASHINGTON -DJ- Tomorrow, with another Federal Open Market Committee meeting at hand, four Federal Reserve Bank Presidents will testify before Congress on legislation that seeks formally to elevate the obliteration of inflation to primacy among the Fed's goals. \n\n  Given the forum and cast of characters at the hearing, it shouldn't be surprising if the Fed comes off sounding prepared to quash inflation, come what may. \n\n  The hearing will be held by the House Domestic Monetary Policy Subcommittee, whose chairman, Rep.

Macke. \n\n  In the 13-week period a year ago, the company earned $182 million, or $2.31 a share. The per-share figures represent a sharper rise  than net income because Dayton Hudson repurchased seven million shares. \n\n  Macke told Dow Jones in an interview that the expected 37% earnings increase is due to a strong performance at the company's retail units and to a credit for adjusting inventories for inflation. \n\n  Dayton Hudson plans to release its earnings on Thursday. \n\n  Macke attributed the strong showing to a 9% increase in sales to $4.48 billion from $4.1 billion a year-earlier.  But he said the fourth-quarter figures also got a boost from a credit of $31 million, or 26 cents a share, for adjusting the company's inventories for inflation.  In the year-ago quarter, such adjustments resulted in a charge of $8 million, or 6 cents a share. \n\n  For the 53-week fiscal year, Macke said Dayton Hudson would report record earnings of $410 million, or $5.35 a share on a fully diluted basis.  That represents a 43% increase over the $287 million, or $3.45 a share, the company earned in its previous fiscal year. \n\n  Sales in the latest fiscal year rose nearly 12% to $13.64 billion from $12.2 billion, he said.

And recessions are often followed by \"a shot in the arm\" for the economy, which can spawn an inflation problem all over again, he added. \n\n  Parry spoke to Dow Jones a few days after the government reported that the consumer price index rose at an 8.5 pc annual rate in the first quarter, its fastest pace since the spring of 1982, when the country was emerging from a wrenching bout of double-digit inflation. Much of the winter spike stemmed from a surge in food and energy prices after a bitter cold wave wiped out crops and boosted energy use, depleting supplies. \n\n  Over the past 12 months, according to the government, consumer prices have risen 5.2 pc. Citing a recent retreat of energy prices from their January highs, Parry said inflation was likely to fall back below 5 pc for 1990, but he predicted the rate would be faster than the 4.6 pc pace for 1989. \n\n  Parry said the best recipe for curing inflation is slow, steady growth over the long haul. But he predicted that the economy's current pace of expansion will lead only to mild gains against inflation. \n\n  Parry forecast that the economy's inflation-adjusted growth in 1990 will be \"slightly over 2 pc,\" compared with 1989 growth of 3 pc.  But he said he \"wouldn't be upset if growth were a little lower.\" \n\n  Two percent growth this year \"will help but it isn't going to produce any significant change in inflation,\" he explained. \"If (the economy's) potential growth is 2.5 pc to 3 pc the amount of slack that likely to result from growth a little over 2 pc is not that great.\" \n\n  Parry estimated that growth in the first quarter could have been \"as high as 2.5 pc to 3 pc.\" Next Friday, the Commerce Department will disclose its first estimate of first-quarter growth. \n\n  Parry does not currently vote on the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 20, 1990 14:58 ET (18:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.859209Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-20T20:00:24.035436Z", "inner_id": 18, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5387, "annotations": [{"id": 4993, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "arR4qqnppz", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-20T20:00:46.667474Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-20T20:00:46.667489Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 21.937, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e273b9f9-64e0-4c97-8e32-c99199702399", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5387, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Cyprus Minerals 1st Qtr Net 65c A Shr Vs $1.96\n\n \n\n  1st Quar March 31: \n\n   1990          1989 \n   Revenues          $429,500,000  $435,800,000 \n   Net income          30,100,000    81,000,000 \n\n  Shr ern (primary) \n\n   Net income                .65        1.96 \n\n  Shr ern (diluted) \n\n   Net income                .62        1.69 \n\n  Cyprus Minerals Co. said the decline in its first quarter earnings was due largely to lower 1990 copper and molybdenum prices. \n\n  Cyprus said copper prices averaged $1.13 per pound during the first quarter of 1990, down 34 cents per pound from the first quarter of 1989. \n\n  Cyprus' average mine production costs for copper, including depreciation, averaged 77 cents per pound during the quarter, compared with 1989 costs of 70 cents per pound.

instances, firms may have experienced a decline of credit availability to carry out their business activities,\" Taylor said from prepared text in Houston, available here in advance. \n\n  On a related topic, the Resolution Trust Corp.'s disposition of failed thrifts' real estate assets, Taylor said that such disposition \"will no doubt complicate the management of bank lending activities, particularly as it relates to real estate loans. \n\n  \"Prices in various segments of the real estate market will be affected, and managers of lending institutions will have to monitor carefully the potential impact on their institutions' loan portfolios.\" \n\n  Taylor said that in their lending activities, \"bank lenders will have to place greater emphasis on a property's cash-generating capacity under prevailing market conditions and less on the assumption or expectation of continually rising real estate prices. \n\n  \"While creating difficulties in the short-run, this adjustment process is necessary if the economy and financial institutions are to be in a position to respond adequately to future growth opportunities,\" he said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 22,

Even though the steel industry as a whole will ship less in 1990 - about 80 million tons compared to 84 million in 1989 - the drop is considered relatively small.  Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman Walter F.  Williams noted in a Dow Jones interview that the industry shipped around 100 million tons in 1980 and two years later was only shipping 62 million tons. \n\n  \"The industry is more stable now,\" he said, as more efficient steelmakers have slashed capacity and costs.  He believes the industry will continue to ship around 80 million tons in the foreseeable future, with a possible low of 75 million tons and a high of about 83 million tons.  \"That's a heck of a lot better than a swing of 40 million tons,\" he said. \n\n  As a result, although Wall Street views steel as a cyclical, unglamorous industry, he believes investors look more favorably on it than they did five years ago.  Still, the industry must do more.  \"My big fear is people thinking that the job is done.  This isn't the time to get complacent,\" he said. \n\n  Williams said prices seem to have stabilized and are on the upswing as steelmakers try to pass on higher raw material and operating expenses, including labor costs associated with a four-year contract negotiated last year with United Steelworkers of America.  Bethlehem and other major steelmakers have upped the cost of key cold and hot rolled sheet effective with July 1 shipments. \n\n  \"I think we've sort of hit the bottom in pricing,\" he said. \n\n  One potentially huge market for steelmakers is rebuilding the country's long-neglected infrastructure.  Williams believes that improvements to the country's bridges, roads, airports, sewers and industrial plants are not only inevitable, but imperative for America to remain competitive. The problem is financing. \n\n  \"I'm saying it's necessary and we need to find a way to do it,\" he said.  Some large industrial companies are already taking steps.  Williams noted that a large unnamed plate fabricator is booked through 1990 with orders to build tanks for a chemical company whose storage facilities had not been updated for years. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 05, 1990 12:17 ET (16:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.859552Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-20T20:43:26.348450Z", "inner_id": 30, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5399, "annotations": [{"id": 5005, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "CZZEWkMFs4", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-20T20:44:25.411398Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-20T20:44:25.411433Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 58.174, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "6e61b446-c0e4-4566-a3c2-8e8621559ea2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5399, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "E.

According to the terms of the accord, workers will receive a pay raise of 250 Deutsche marks per month retroactive to July 1 and their work week will be reduced from the current 43 hours to 40 hours at the latest by October.

Urban, chairman and president, told Dow Jones. \n\n  The projection indicates, however, that net income for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31 will probably slip. \n\n  The record net income for the third quarter will be partially offset by a record loss for the first six months of the year. What's more, the results for the 1989 fiscal year include a gain on the sale of an equity interest in an animal vaccine business. \n\n  Pioneer, the nation's largest agricultural seed concern, believes that it controls about 35.5% of corn seed sold in North America, up about 1.3 percentage points from the 1989 planting season, Urban said. Corn is the biggest U.S.  crop. \n\n  Pioneer's market share increased amid less-than-expected sales gains for the U.S. seed industry. An unusually wet spring delayed many farmers from planting corn for so long that they switched to other crops or abandoned their fields. \n\n  Urban wouldn't disclose how much Pioneer's North American corn seed sales increased in the 1990 planting season other than to say sales \"are up significantly.\" \n\n  According to industry analysts and competitors, Pioneer did everything from cut prices to give away free bags of seed in order to stop the erosion of its market share. \n\n  Urban, however, said the market share rebound was the pay off from the company's reorganization of its sales force three years ago. \"I think we are better sales people,\" he said. \n\n  A slightly higher-than-normal amount of seed was given to farmers as free samples because the company introduced a large number of new hybrid seed products, he said. \n\n  Pioneer's sales strategy is increasingly based on introducing a large number of new hybrids. This year, the company offered 22 new hybrids to farmers. Another 17 new hybrids are being grown by the company for sale next year. \n\n  \"We are into a new era,\" Pioneer Chairman Urban said. \"We will be introducing new hybrids at a rapid pace on a regular basis.\" \n\n  Urban wouldn't predict the earnings for the third quarter ended May 31 that the company expects to report Friday. \n\n  Wall Street estimates that the company will report fiscal third quarter net income from continuing operations per share of between $4.54 and $4.70 \"isn't a bad range,\" Urban said. \"It will be the best third quarter we have ever had.\" \n\n  In the same 1989 quarter, Pioneer reported income from continuing operations of $114.6 million, or $3.59 a share, on sales of $608.1 million.  Income from discontinued operations of $605,000 made final net income $115.2 million, or $3.61 a share. \n\n  Much of Pioneer's business is generated in the fiscal third quarter, which is when most of its customers pay for the seed they ordered for spring planting. Some other seed companies record their sales earlier in the season when they deliver seed to their dealers. \n\n  Despite a record third quarter, the company's results for the full year ending Aug. 31 will be held back by a loss of $51.8 million, or $1.66 a share, generated during the first six months of the fiscal year. \n\n  At the same time, the company's 1989 results were inflated by a gain from the sale of its equity interest in a vaccine maker. The sale of the interest in the Agrion operation contributed 27 cents a share to the company's net income from continuing operations of $81.9 million, or $2.58 a share. Income from discontinued operations of $16.3 million made final net income $98.2 million, or $3.09 a share, for fiscal 1989. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 12, 1990 14:51 ET (18:51 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.859621Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:16:00.041868Z", "inner_id": 32, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5401, "annotations": [{"id": 5060, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "0JOPdWa9Jq", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T21:16:51.755784Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:16:51.755809Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 50.925, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d4960ece-d056-4ac8-9213-c332fe2c6a44", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5401, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Bear Stearns Analysts See U S Rates At 7-7 1/2% By Year End\n\n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- Bear Stearns & Co.  analysts expect short- and long-term U.S. interest rates in the 7-7 1/2% range by yearend. \n\n  Writing in the firm's latest \"Global Spectator,\" the analysts say, \"Provided that fiscal policy mistakes don't stand in the way, stock prices should rise substantially.

Inc. \n\n  Roach says his calculations show core inflation up at a 5.9% annual rate through the first seven months of 1990, compared with a 4.7% rate for the first seven months in 1989. \n\n  \"The sharp rise in core inflation reflects an economy that is clearly sending some ominous signals ... even before we deal with a full-blown energy crisis,\" he says. \n\n  John Williams, economist at Bankers Trust Co., says, \"The way to explain it, is it's alarming.\" \n\n  \"When you consider that energy prices were down in this report and when you consider that's not likely to happen again soon, the prospects for inflation are not very rosy at the moment,\" Williams says. \n\n  The consumer price index for July continues to show the difficulty in reining in medical costs, which are more or less impervious to supply and demand forces. \n\n  Medical costs showed the sharpest rise among major CPI components in July, leaping 0.9% after rising 0.7% in June and 0.8% in May. \n\n  \"We've got to find a way to get a handle on medical costs,\" says Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. \n\n  Stone says much of the increase in the July CPI may be the result of higher local taxes, and thus may represent a one-time surge in the inflation rate. \n\n  \"It looks like some sales tax increases got to us in here, so that many of these items suffered a one-shot surge in prices,\" she says. \"The surge in tobacco prices is a case in point.\" \n\n  Tobacco-price increases due to tax hikes accounted for a large part of the increase in the \"other\" category of CPI. Tobacco prices, which were up 2.7% in July, account for about 1.5% of the CPI index. \n\n  In addition, new hotel room taxes may have accounted for the rise in \"other renters' costs\" that helped boost the housing category 0.5% in July, Stone says. \n\n  Noting that apparel prices and automobile prices fell in the month, she says the overall CPI increase was \"sharp but it wasn't pervasive.\" \n\n  Nevertheless, \"inflation is jumping to center stage,\" says Morgan Stanley's Roach. \n\n  He says CPI inflation surged in the first quarter of 1990, followed by a \"breathing spell\" in the seocnd quarter.  Now it may be heating up again. \n\n  The confluence of the Persian Gulf crisis and a robust inflation reading could well freeze monetary policy, says Bankers Trust's Williams. \n\n  \"The markets know that the Fed is as uncertain about the future as the rest of us are,\" he says, and would probably deem any bold move in changing policy foolish. \n\n  \"Don't just do something, sit there,\" might be the Fed's only choice, he says. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 16, 1990 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.859738Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:19:37.740965Z", "inner_id": 36, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5405, "annotations": [{"id": 5064, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "pSn41x7Kh5", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T21:20:41.730874Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:20:41.730899Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 63.227, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "25648d5c-8ea9-4217-b479-5401bf615715", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5405, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Oil Company Stocks Lower -2-\n\n \n\n  Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.  analyst Michael Young tells Dow Jones Professional Investor Report oil prices above $30 a barrel are counterproductive both to the oil stocks prospects and the broader market as well. \n\n  On the morning call today to clients and brokers, Young said it was time to take profits in the oil patch.  \"Oil stocks can't continue to go up if the market continues to go down,\" he said. \n\n  In particular, Young downgraded British Petroleum Co.  to \"hold\" from \"buy\" on a price basis, noting the stock is up 27% in the third quarter alone. \n\n  Smith Barney also removed Amerada Hess Corp. and Amoco Corp. from its Investment Policy Committe buy list. \n\n  At current prices, both companies are showing relatively weaker dividend yields, says Young.

But the Bundesbank official stressed that tight monetary policies would remain intact and that he didn't envision German inflation growing much. \n\n  With the cost of German unification expected to mount, Schlesinger added tax increases would be \"a last resort.\" But he noted that the government is also weighing cuts in expenditures, particularly those designed as subsidies. \n\n  And while \"presumably this is not enough,\" another option to offset the costs of financing economic reforms in East Germany is also capital market borrowing, he said. \n\n  On Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, Schlesinger was cautious, saying that \"It's not really the position of the Bundesbank to decide on sterling and the ERM.  It is a question on when the U.K. can come in.  But the U.K.  has to decide when.\" \n\n  Sterling fell sharply last Friday on reports that Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl suggested Britain shouldn't enter given its high inflation rate. \n\n  Schlesinger rejected that suggestion.

Capital equipment costs rose an adjusted 0.8% after rising 0.3%. \n\n  Energy prices rose 13.8% in September, compared with a 9.5% rise the prior month. \n\n  Before seasonal adjustment, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose 0.9% last month to 120.3% of the 1982 average and stood 5.9% ahead of the index reading a year earlier. \n\n  The PPI for intermediate goods, which have had some processing, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.8% last month after increasing an adjusted 1.3% in the preceding month. Before seasonal adjustment, this index rose 1.7% and stood at 116.3% of its 1982 average, up 3.5% from a year earlier. \n\n  The PPI for crude goods rose a seasonally adjusted 4.6% last month after increasing an adjusted 9.3% in the preceding month. Before seasonal adjustment, this index rose 4.4% and stood at 115.1% of its 1982 average, up 12.5% from a year earlier. \n\n  The 13.8% increase in September energy prices is the largest recorded since the Labor Department began tracking producer prices, a Labor official said. The second largest monthly increase occurred in January, when energy prices moved up 13.7%. \n\n  As reported, both the gasoline and home heating oil indexes climbed more than 20% in September. In addition, the index for natural gas increased 1.3% after falling 9.4% in August, Labor said. \n\n  Food prices, meanwhile, moved down 0.9% after increasing 0.8% in August.  Prices fell in September for beef and veal, eggs, fresh vegetables, shortening and pasta.  Prices for dairy products and pork also fell in September, Labor said. \n\n  As reported in the intermediate goods category, prices rose 1.8% in September following a 1.3% increase in August. As was the case in August, the energy component contributed to much of the increase. \n\n  Nondurable manufacturing materials, for example, jumped 2.0% in September after rising 0.1% in August.

Nonetheless, traders are pushing the currency down a bit too quickly, he asserted. \n\n  Mieno said that the stronger yen lessens inflationary pressures within the Japanese economy.  But the economy's tendency toward inflation still requires vigilance on the part of the Bank of Japan. Currently, the central bank doesn't intend to change its monetary policy and is watching the effects of the last discount rate rise on Aug. 30. \n\n  Mieno observed that Tokyo stock prices have recovered slightly since the Ministry of Finance announced measures Oct.  1 to support the market.  He repeated his position that a central bank governor shouldn't comment on the appropriate level for stock prices. \n\n  But while Mieno was unwilling to discuss particular levels of stock prices, he said that in any market they should stabilize at a range that reflects the prospects for growth in the economy. \n\n  Touching on the Ministry of Finance's measures to support the market, Mieno said that comments by Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the beginning of the month reflected the general need to support the stock market rather than initiatives in monetary policy. \n\n  Hashimoto said Oct. 1 that monetary policy should be directed to stabilize the market, remarks that led some to speculate of a clash between the Bank of Japan and the ministry over formation of policy. \n\n  Mieno said that, though the drop in the stock market made it more difficult for Japanese banks to meet Bank for International Settlement (BIS) requirements, the BIS requirements aren't just a number to be reached but are meant to make banks financially sound. \n\n  He said even though the stock market has dropped, banks still have enough time to meet the BIS standards before the March 1993 deadline. By then, banks must have capital equal to 8 pc of their risk-weighted assets, although by March of next year, the interim ratio must be 7.25 pc. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 11, 1990 07:30 ET (11:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.860110Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:49:05.878069Z", "inner_id": 49, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5418, "annotations": [{"id": 5077, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "uIy-xlYnFE", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T21:49:38.081885Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:49:38.081909Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 31.475, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "c0247a9b-de5f-4dc5-b5fb-6508864533b3", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5418, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "U.K. Producer Output Prices In Sept.

Memberships increased 22 pc in 1990 compared to the prior year, and price increases averaged between 10 pc and 20 pc, he said. The company also reduced the amount of hospital services it uses - \"one of our efficiency measures\" - but that was offset by an increase in administrative costs \"related primarily to digesting the growth we've had,\" he said. \n\n  Given the rate of growth, PacifiCare expects revenue to increase about 20 pc in fiscal 1991, \"and we are hopeful that our bottom line will also grow by 20 pc,\" Lowell said. \n\n  For the year ended Sept. 30, net income \"slightly exceeded\" analysts' high expectations of $17.4 million, or $1.45 a share, and revenue was between $970 million and $980 million, he said.

Housing Affordability Index Rises\n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON -DJ- Declines in the median home price and average interest rate and an increase in the median family income lifted the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index in October to its highest point in more than two years, the association said. \n\n  NAR's Housing Affordability Index, which measures the ability of a typical family to purchase a median-priced resale home, was 113.4 in October, up from 110.8 in September. At 113.4, the index shows that a family earning the national median income of $35,353 in October had 113.4 pc of the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 80 pc of a home priced at $92,800, the median existing-home price for that month. \n\n  The October index rose due to a change in three major components of the purchasing power measurement - the median resale home price, median family income and the average mortgage rate.  Each change had a positive effect on the index last month.  Not since September of 1988, when the index was 113.5, has it been higher than October's reading. And, prior to that, the index had not been higher than 113.4 since December 1977 when it was 116.0. The October increase in the index this year was the greatest since December 1989. \n\n  \"Objectively, market conditions are excellent, and are at odds with home sales activity,\" said NAR President Harley E. Rouda. \"The missing link is consumer confidence - the housing affordability index indicates that conditions are better than they've been in over two years,\" he said. \n\n  \"With home prices relatively low right now, and fixed-rate mortgages available at less than 10 pc, the market is ripe for buyers who have been waiting for the best time to buy a home,\" Rouda, the newly elected 1991 NAR president, said. \n\n  The September index, now estimated at 110.8, previously had been estimated at 110.9. \n\n  The October median home price of $92,800 is down from a median price of $94,400 in September, according to the Realtors Association. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 03, 1990 09:10 ET (14:10 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.860304Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:55:58.617729Z", "inner_id": 56, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5425, "annotations": [{"id": 5084, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "ZyzJL06PKR", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T21:57:53.005085Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:57:53.005110Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 113.491, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "fd8a622e-8ff4-48d8-970e-5fd4c5f6a1bd", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5425, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Analysts See Bank Of Canada Rate Down 25 Points Tomorrow\n\n \n   By Rose Tamburri \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  OTTAWA -DJ- The Bank of Canada's bank rate is expected to decline by about 25 basis points tomorrow from its current level of 12.01 pc, following a decline in the U.S. discount rate yesterday, money-market analysts said. \n\n  The expected bank rate drop follows a 15-point decline last week and would bring the rate to its lowest level since February 1989. \n\n  The bank rate is set each week at 25 basis points above the average yield on three-month treasury bills at the Thursday auction.  It is the rate the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions. \n\n  Canadian money-market rates are sharply lower today partly because of a one-half percentage point cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5 pc, said John McCarthy, chief \n\nmoney-market dealer at Toronto-Dominion Bank.   The discount rate is the levy the U.S. Federal Reserve Board charges on loans to banks. \n\n  Michael Gregory, Royal Bank of Canada economist, said lower U.S.  short-term rates will create \"a window for the Bank of Canada\" to allow further declines in Canadian rates. \n\n  \"We're in a phase of significant rate declines,\" Gregory said.  He predicted that Canadian short-term rates will fall an additional 100 basis points over the next two months because of continuing weakness in the Canadian economy. \n\n  With U.S. rates also declining, the spread between Canadian and U.S.  short-term rates is expected to remain little changed, keeping the Canadian dollar firm, Gregory said.  At mid-day, the Canadian currency was trading at 86.27c (U.S.). \n\n  Gregory predicted the decline in Canadian short-term rates would continue until February when the inflationary impact of the government's 7 pc goods and services tax is expected to push up Canada's consumer price index.  Then, the central bank will begin to exercise \"some caution,\" Gregory said. The tax will take effect Jan. 1 and is expected to boost Canada's CPI on a one-time basis by 1.25 percentage points. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 19, 1990 14:23 ET (19:23 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.860332Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T21:57:53.235696Z", "inner_id": 57, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5426, "annotations": [{"id": 5085, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "azQGDk4Hw3", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T22:01:06.498944Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:01:06.498977Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-21T22:01:05.453365Z", "lead_time": 192.59, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "0be9515b-8ddb-4dd2-b3c6-bd012150445f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5426, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Newsprint Prices Seen Weaker As Strikes End In Eastern Cda\n\n \n   By G.

A metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds. \n\n  Newsprint producers raised list prices by about 5 pc on June 1, their first increase in more than two years.  They made that price hike stick largely because of the threat of strikes at mills in eastern Canada, many analysts and newsprint buyers argue. \n\n  Labor negotiations in the eastern Canadian paper industry did turn out to be difficult, and at one point this fall, as much as 15 pc of North American capacity was shut by strikes. Supplies were tight newspaper buyers said, but there weren't any big shortages. \n\n  This week striking workers at four mills representing about 10 pc of North American capacity signed new labor agreements. \n\n  Tribune Co. unit Quebec & Ontario Paper's mill at Thorold, Ontario, reopened after a four-month strike. \n\n  Workers at two big Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. mills, on strike since September and October respectively, ratified new contracts.

nation's Gross National Product expanded at a revised seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4% in the third quarter, after inflation is taken into account, the Commerce Department said. \n\n  The department's latest estimate of economic growth in the July-September period, its third and final estimate, was down from the 1.7% increase estimated last month. \n\n  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of 13 economists published Monday found an average expectation that GNP would grow at a 1.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate during the third quarter. \n\n  The GNP grew at real seasonally adjusted annual rates of 0.4% in the second quarter and 1.7% in the first quarter of 1990. \n\n  In comparing the current GNP estimate to last month's estimate, Commerce said that a downward revision of its consumer spending estimate essentially accounted for the drop. \n\n  The U.S. trade deficit widened, the department noted, but that was offset by increased federal government spending. \n\n  Commerce also said prices, as measured by the GNP-based implicit price deflator, rose at a revised 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter, compared with a 4.0% rise estimated last month. \n\n  Prices, as measured by the fixed-weight index, rose at a revised 4.2% rate in the third quarter, the same as in last month's report. \n\n  Commerce reiterated that due to its methodology, the sharp third-quarter increase in oil prices isn't apparent in the GNP price indexes. \n\n  Following the revision, Commerce estimates third quarter GNP, adjusted to 1982 dollars to account for inflation, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.170 trillion, compared with $4.173 estimated last month and $4.155 trillion in the second quarter. \n\n  Before inflation adjustment, Commerce estimates GNP at $5.515 trillion, compared with $5.521 trillion in last month's report and $5.443 trillion in the second quarter. \n\n  Real final sales, defined as GNP minus business inventories, was $4.165 trillion in the third quarter, compared with $4.168 trillion in last month's report and $4.146 trillion in the second quarter. \n\n  Third quarter GNP stood 0.4% ahead of second quarter GNP, while second quarter GNP gained 0.1% from the first quarter of 1990. \n\n  The after-tax profits of U.S.  corporations rose a revised 8.0% in the third quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $179.4 billion, compared to the 6.7% increase to $177.2 billion estimated last month. \n\n  Third quarter profits before taxes rose a revised 6.4% to a $318.5 billion rate, compared with a 5.4% increase to $315.4 billion estimated last month. \n\n  Profits from current production fell a revised 1.9% in the third quarter to a $300.7 billion rate, compared with the 3.8% fall to $294.9 billion estimated last month. \n\n  Net corporate cash flow decreased a revised 2.0% in the third quarter to a $392.0 billion rate, compared with a 3.2% drop to $387.2 billion in last month's report. \n\n

The company's stock fell more than $4 in reaction. \n\n  3M followed its disappointing earnings with a prediction of more of the same.  \"We look for a difficult business climate through the first half,\" said Allen F.  Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer. He cited economic softness and the war as factors. \n\n  As a result, analysts cut estimates for the year's profit by 10 cents to 20 cents and said 3M's domestic performance is an indication of things to come.  \"It is a harbinger of what other companies are going to be saying,\" said Eugene G. Glazer of Dean Witter, adding that 3M is \"more recession-resistant than most\" industrial giants. \n\n  The company didn't break out geographic results, but it said \"slightly lower selling prices for domestic operations led to a decline in U.S. operating profits. In addition, international profit gains were held back by increased price competition and investments\" in growth. \n\n  Sales rose 11%, to $3.28 billion from $2.95 billion, but only one of four major business sectors -- life sciences -- reported improved U.S.  earnings.  Other areas, including commercial and consumer and information technologies, suffered from eroding profit margins because of a 1% decline in U.S. selling prices and higher raw materials costs. Products particularly hard hit included videocassette tapes and computer diskettes. \n\n  The U.S. results, which one analyst termed \"pretty poor,\" plus the cautious outlook led to a sell-off in the stock, one of the 30 that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading 3M closed at $80.75, down $4.25, on volume of more than 2.6 million shares. \n\n  Some analysts predicted a further drop in the stock Thursday as they broadcast their marked-down earnings estimates for the year. Several analysts cut per-share estimates to the $6.20-$6.30 range from a consensus of $6.40. \n\n  \"The pricing, productivity and cost problems will continue in the first quarter,\" Smith Barney analyst Peter J.

Depicted lately as wavering on the tax issue, Bush declared himself to be \"firmly committed\" to lowering the cost of capital. \n\n  Writing in his annual economic report to Congress, the president argued that the Fed's credibility as an inflation-fighter is sufficiently high that the central bank can now pursue policies adequate to \"significantly\" mitigate the current economic downturn without engendering fears of a fresh price spiral. \n\n  The underlying rate of U.S.  inflation was showing \"clear signs\" of falling at the end of 1990 and price pressures are expected to ease further this year, Bush said. \n\n  Elsewhere in the report, the president's Council of Economic Advisers maintained that lower interest rates alone aren't necessarily indicative of easier money, but rather may reflect declining demand for credit.  The three administration economists, led by Michael Boskin, called for money supply growth \"well within\" the target ranges to be set shortly by the central bank for 1991. \n\n  Easier money policies in the U.S., combined with a recent rise in West German interest rates and firm rates in Japan, have served to put considerable downward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets, but the administration is apparently prepared to live with that situation in the interest of getting the U.S. economy moving again. \n\n  Bush didn't mention the U.S.  currency in his personal introduction to the annual economic report and his advisers, who wrote the bulk of the lengthy document, only touched on the dollar.  Achieving strong non-inflationary domestic economic growth requires, among other things, \"a sustainable trade balance and relatively stable exchange rates,\" the White House economists said. \n\n  The G-7 group of major industrial nations, where foreign exchange rate policy has at times been coordinated, was mentioned only briefly - as \"a framework within which economic issues of mutual concern can be discussed.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 12, 1991 10:01 ET (15:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.896124Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:09:41.707539Z", "inner_id": 68, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5437, "annotations": [{"id": 5096, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "k8q9Yt0vci", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T22:10:20.946637Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:10:20.946663Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 38.548, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e177fe31-a240-4858-a86f-b75d999acdf3", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5437, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Noranda Forest 4th Qtr Loss 62c (Cdn) A Shr Vs Net 22c\n\n \n\n  Quar Dec. 31: \n\n   1990           1989 \n   Sales          C$1,051,000,000  C$1,239,000,000 \n   Net income         (57,000,000)      27,000,000 \n\n  Shr ern (primary) \n\n   Net income              (0.62)       0.22 \n\n  Year: \n\n   Sales            4,555,000,000    4,868,000,000 \n   Net income         (95,000,000)     189,000,000 \n\n  Shr ern (primary): \n\n   Net income              (1.16)       1.72 \n\n  Figures in brackets are losses. \n\n  The company said the general weakness in domestic and overseas markets in 1990 resulted in production downtime and lower prices.

There was no immediate explanation for his negative vote. \n\n  -0- \n\n  In conjunction with the move, the Fed also lowered its target for the important federal funds interest rate to 5.75% from 6%. Other interest rates are expected to fall in turn. \n\n  The Fed's action comes as the Bush administration has begun considering whether to reappoint Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires in August. Some administration officials -- including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu -- have been critical of Greenspan because of the Fed's reluctance to cut rates. But administration officials said Bush's praise yesterday is a sign that he is likely to reappoint Greenspan. \n\n  Officials familiar with the Fed's deliberations say the board has been debating the rate-cutting move for several weeks. Greenspan and Fed Governor David Mullins are said to have become increasingly concerned about signs of continued weakness among manufacturers. But Governors Angell, John LaWare and Edward Kelley were all reluctant to move. \n\n  LaWare and Kelley finally agreed to the rate cut Tuesday. \n\n  Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in an interview Tuesday that he still believes \"there is ample room for lower interest rates.\" \n\n  Tuesday's action was unusual: The Fed wanted to engineer a small cut in the federal funds rate, but was forced to cut the discount rate first in order to prevent the federal funds rate from dropping below it. The Fed usually keeps the funds rate higher than the discount rate, and Fed officials feared any change in that practice would confuse people in the financial markets. \n\n  The discount rate is set solely by the Fed governors in Washington. But the more important funds rate is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, which includes the governors plus five of the 12 regional Fed presidents from outside of Washington. \n\n  In recent months, Greenspan has been under criticism from several regional presidents, who argue that he exceeded his authority earlier this year to alter the funds rate target between meetings of the committee. The Fed chairman skirted that issue yesterday by cutting the funds rate only a quarter percentage point; the directive adopted by the committee at its last meeting on March 26 gave him the authority to cut the rate that much, but no more. \n\n  Angell reportedly voted against the move because he was afraid Fed easing might increase worries about inflation and cause bond traders to drive up interest rates on long-term bonds. He believes the best way to ensure an economic recovery is to bring down long-term interest rates, which affect the housing market, rather than reducing short-term rates. \n\n  But the bond markets, at least yesterday, were encouraged by the Fed's move, and long-term rates declined. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 30, 1991 09:30 ET (13:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.896382Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:49:32.264310Z", "inner_id": 77, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5446, "annotations": [{"id": 5105, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "vr5LEwSPBb", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T22:49:59.741365Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:49:59.741390Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 26.814, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d5f5d51e-9361-4345-975a-36f698c469f8", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5446, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Texaco Inc. 1st Quarter Net $1.51 A Share Vs. $1.15\n\n \n\n  1st Quar March 31: \n\n   1991          1990 \n   Revenues        $10,180,000,000  $9,156,000,000 \n   Net income          415,000,000     328,000,000 \n   Avg shares          258,200,000     263,700,000 \n\n  Shr ern: \n\n   Net income                1.51       1.15 \n\n  Texaco Inc. said first-quarter earnings reflected improved refined product margins in international downstream operations. \n\n  Revenues reflected higher average worldwide crude oil and refined product prices and higher crude sales volumes, the company said. \n\n  Margins in Europe were higher as a result of operational improvements, completed capital programs and improved prices due to tight supplies and colder weather, Texaco said in a press release. \n\n  Margins in the Far East improved, primarily in Japan, which allowed the flow through of 1990 crude costs.

Korea Narrows But Frictions Remain\n\n \n   By Carl Johnston \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  WASHINGTON -DJ- The U.S.  continues to charge South Korea with unfair trading practices, but is enjoying the best trade performance with the East Asian nation since the early 1980s. \n\n  Although Korean trade barriers remain high, and some reports show that frictions have actually increased, South Korea's bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. has been progressively whittled away since its peak in 1988. \n\n  The reasons are numerous and have more to do with the nations' domestic economy than international factors.  The factors include: the appreciation of the Korean currency, the won; domestic inflation; labor disputes; rising labor costs and a relative slowing of economic growth, according to Renato Amador, South Korea Desk Officer at the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration. \n\n  \"There's really not one factor, there's a whole range of reasons,\" for the narrowing of South Korea's trade surplus, says Amador. \n\n  Amador notes that South Korea is in an \"evolutionary\" phase of its economic development as it begins to increase domestic consumption and labor wages rise.  In the meantime, Gross National Product (GNP) growth has slowed from its blistering double-digit pace in 1986-1988 to a more \"moderate\" 9 pc expansion rate in 1990. \n\n  The Commerce Department said that the U.S. had a $39.6 million trade deficit with South Korea in January 1991, continuing a trend of sharp improvement in the U.S. bilateral trade performance.  The U.S. hasn't had a monthly surplus with South Korea since a $1.5 million surplus in April 1983. \n\n  For all of 1990, the U.S.  had a deficit of $4.1 billion, down substantially from $6.3 billion in 1989 and a peak of $8.9 billion in 1988. \n\n  Measured in other ways, the U.S.  trade performance has improved even more. The Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry estimates that the U.S.  actually registered a $143 million surplus in January.  The ministry also says that its overall trade deficit widened to $1.6 billion in February, from $573 million in February 1990. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 05, 1991 17:06 ET (22:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.896469Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:51:50.283994Z", "inner_id": 80, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5449, "annotations": [{"id": 5108, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "DjKJZ8XDaU", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T22:52:18.709186Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:52:18.709204Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 27.733, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3f961228-6fe4-4557-b6b9-b95267d07aac", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5449, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Bank Of Canada Says On Track To Meet 1991 Inflation Target\n\n \n   By John Urquhart \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  OTTAWA - The Bank of Canada is believed to be on track to meet its 1991 guidepost for inflation reduction, official sources said. \n\n  The guidepost requires that the rise in the consumer price index by the end of this year be held to less than 4 pc from a year earlier after adjustment for indirect taxes, including a 7 pc goods and service tax introduced Jan.  1. \n\n  The Bank of Canada set only a provisional inflation benchmark for this year because of the price impact of the new value-added tax.  The government has estimated that the new levy will push up consumer prices by an additional 1 1/4 pc this year. \n\n  The sources said that after eliminating the estimated impact of the new GST tax and other new indirect taxes, they were reasonably confident that the 1991 inflation guidepost would be reached.  The central bank is expected to announce later this year its estimates of the 1991 price impact of the various new indirect taxes imposed by the federal and provincial governments. \n\n  The Bank of Canada's formal inflation reduction targets, announced with the Finance Department in late February, call for the rise in the consumer price index to be held to 3 pc by the end of 1992, 2.5 pc by mid-1994 and 2 pc by the end of 1995.  Thereafter, the objective would be further reductions in inflation until price stability is achieved. \n\n  The sources said the Bank of Canada remains concerned about the potential inflationary impact of Canadian wage settlements.

In April, the median new home price was $122,000, while the median price of an existing single-family home was $100,200. \n\n  A rebound in home construction won't be held back by a lack of workers. The industry has lost about one-tenth of its jobs over the past year. \n\n  Many of those residential construction workers may return to work soon, as builder inventories have declined to 7.4 months at the current sales pace from a high of 9.3 months in January. \n\n  The Commerce Department revised April housing starts upward to show an increase of 8.2% to a 981,000 starts rate. The April gain was originally estimated at 6.2% and the level at 957,000. \n\n  The April-May gains in housing starts constitute the first back-to-back monthly increase in starts since June-July 1989, Commerce said. \n\n  Building permits data included in the starts report provide more evidence that residential construction rebounded in May. \n\n  May permits rose 7.2 pc to a seasonally adjusted 979,000 annual rate, after a 2.4 pc gain in April to a 913,000 annual rate. \n\n  The April permits data are unchanged from that released by the Commerce Department late last month.  The department revises permits data about six days after the starts release. \n\n  About 75 pc of permits in a given month are issued for single-family homes and are thought to be contemperaneous with starts. That means the strong rise in May single-family permits might not translate into a sizable rise in June starts. \n\n  Multi-family permits, however, do have a long lead time before translating into construction, and there the data signal a busy summer. \n\n  Permits for structures with five units or more, surely the most beleaguered housing sector the past few years, rose nearly 50 pc in May. \n\n  The multi-family sector could use a boost, as May starts sunk to their lowest level - 118,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate - since Commerce began measuring the statistics in 1963. \n\n  The despairing May level of multi-family starts is a level \"no econometric model would have predicted,\" says Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. \n\n  \"The permit rise is a hopeful sign that maybe, just maybe, this time we've hit bottom.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 18, 1991 10:32 ET (14:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.896707Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:57:26.198671Z", "inner_id": 88, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5457, "annotations": [{"id": 5116, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "xfrCJYHKLN", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-21T22:58:43.990809Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-21T22:58:43.990844Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-21T22:58:43.467980Z", "lead_time": 77.117, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "0e8a85bd-67ec-47dd-a986-f25347741107", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5457, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Faster Non-Inflationary Growth Possible, Seger Says\n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON -DJ- Former Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger said it's possible for the economy to grow faster without necessarily sparking a resurgence of inflation. \n\n  In remarks to the Global Economic Action Committee, Seger noted that financial market participants have become \"skittish\" about the prospects of an economic recovery because they fear a return to high rates of inflation. \n\n  \"As soon as you mention the word growth, people start throwing bonds out the window because of the inflation concern,\" Seger said. \"But that's not the case.\" \n\n  Seger also took note of the 25 pc rise in the dollar against the deustche mark over the past several marks and said it has contributed to a slowdown in export growth in a number of areas.

In November, they will re-base to 1987 values,\" he said. \n\n  Based on the current convention, DRI/McGraw-Hill noted that the government projects a cumulative annual decline in output during the recession of 1.0%, compared with a postwar recession average of 2.6 pc. Re-based to 1987, the current recession will appear somewhat deeper, according to Brinner, with a peak-to-trough decline of 1.3%. But even this understates the downturn, he said. \n\n  Using 1990 as the base year for calculating real GNP yields more accurate results, Brinner said.  \"Measured in 1990 dollars, real growth in the fourth quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991 declined at annualized rates of 5.3% and 1.7%, respectively. This implies a recession characterized by a decline of almost 2.0% in output, nearly double the 1.0% currently reported in 1982 dollars.\" \n\n  The inflation picture is also worse than government estimates suggest, Brinner said: \"In 1990, the price index for all goods and services rose 4.9%, rather than 4.1%, if the benchmark year for evaluating output is shifted to 1990 from 1982. Similarly, the outlook for inflation this year - using the 1990 benchmark - is currently 4.0 pc, not 3.6%.

Smith \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- Computer-guided buy programs prodded the market higher late in today's session after stocks took a midday nap. \n\n  Share prices started the day higher as investors bought stocks after a key inflation report sent yields falling in the bond market. \n\n  The Producer Price Index for June fell 0.3%, while excluding the volatile food and energy sectors the index was unchanged for the month. Many economists had expected the index to rise, reflecting growing inflationary pressures as the economy lifts from the recession. \n\n  But stocks soon settled down as a number of weak earnings reports sapped investor enthusiasm.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which hit resistance at about the 2,975 issue in its morning, scraped along the 2,950 level through the middle of the day. \n\n  Trading activity had begun to wane when the program buy programs snapped stock prices out of their slumber, sending the Dow Jones average to its highs for the day.  The industrials ended off those highs with a 21.02 point gain at 2,980.77. \n\n  Newton Zinder, technical analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the market may be headed to restest its old highs in the week ahead. \n\n  \"The market was helped by the fact that it didn't collapse during the mid-session selloff,\" said Zinder.  He also noted that the number of advancing stocks held above the number of declining stocks throughout the day. \n\n  \"The market's breadth has held up very well this week, even when the Dow (Jones average) was down,\" said Zinder. \n\n  At the close today, 1,017 stocks had advanced in price, while 496 had fallen.

The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond eased to just under 8.44%. \n\n  But earnings have yet to show any evidence of strength. Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody, said the market will have trouble making sustainable gains with profit reports arriving in force next week. \n\n  The final Dow Jones Industrial average close was 2,980.77, up 21.02.

Following the release of the figures, which estimated a $348.3 billion deficit, up from its earlier $280.9 billion figure, CBO Director Robert Reischauer said that he expected the CBO revision to be similar to those released from the White House. \n\n  The CBO and White House revisions both reflected weaker-than-expected revenue estimates, due to an overestimation of personal income. \n\n  The CBO projects that the total budget deficit will \"drop back sharply in 1993,\" following the 1991 and 1992 increases. Last year's total deficit was $220 billion. \n\n  The CBO report said that three factors - spending to resolve bank and thrift failures, cost of Operation Desert Storm, and the 1990-91 recession and pending economic recovery - contribute to the \"up and down\" pattern of the deficit. Excluding the temporary factors, the underlying deficit is projected to stabilize in the range of $170 billion to $190 billion over the next several years, the report said. It went on to say that in relation to the size of the economy, \"such deficits are no better than those of the late 1980s and considerably worse than the average of the 1960s and 1970s.\" \n\n  The CBO said that its projections assumed that the economy is in a recovery phase, but will be moderate by historical standards, projecting real gross national product of 3.4% in calendar year 1992 and the average of 2.6% per year between 1993 and 1996.  The CBO also projects that inflation would be lower following the recession and that short term interest rates will rise slightly during the recovery. \n\n  -0- \n\n  Even though the CBO now foresees a wider deficit in each of the next five years than it did just five months ago, it argued in a new 112-page report that last year's deficit-reduction law is working. \"This deterioration in the budget outlook doesn't reflect an erosion of last year's hard-won savings and would have occurred even if the 1990 . . . bill had not been enacted,\" the CBO said. \"Without the spending cuts and tax increases enacted last year, the situation would be considerably worse.\" \n\n  The office attributed the increase in its 1992 deficit estimate to changes in its economic forecast, higher costs in the Medicaid health-care program for the poor, added spending in the near term on deposit insurance and less revenue than anticipated. \n\n  Two-thirds of the changes in the revenue forecasts for the next few years result from the fact that the office now anticipates slower economic growth and a lower inflation rate. The balance reflects its realization that tax collections so far this year are lower than expected. \n\n  After the administration reduced its revenue forecasts, critics of last year's budget law seized on the changes as proof that the tax increases it ordered were counterproductive.  But in its new report, the CBO attacked this argument, saying that the lower projections for tax receipts reflect a slowdown in personal-income growth that predates the tax increases. \n\n  The CBO also said it believes the economy \"has now moved out of recession and into recovery, but that the ensuing expansion will be moderate by historical standards.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 15, 1991 11:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897019Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-22T17:19:05.153517Z", "inner_id": 99, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5468, "annotations": [{"id": 5127, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "H7K__6WgGZ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-22T18:29:14.066078Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-22T18:29:14.066103Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 4208.054, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "90da63c9-cdda-41a7-a437-ef43dc71d1c5", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5468, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Bamberger Polymers 2nd Qtr Loss 42c-Shr Vs Loss Con Op 13c\n\n \n\n  2nd Quar June 30: \n\n   1991         a  1990 \n   Sales             $48,870,000     $43,968,000 \n   Inc cont op        (1,277,000)       (389,000) \n   Inc dis op               ....

In this area, the situation is uncertain.\" \n\n  He said slack in the labor and product markets should restrain growth in labor compensation before long, but he added that \"we haven't seen significant improvement in the data yet.\" \n\n  \"Overall, however, I wouldn't be surprised to see consumer inflation of around 3 pc both this year and next,\" he added. \n\n  The Fed's Parry said he expected the economy to grow much more slowly than in previous recoveries, probably around 3 pc in the first year of the recovery. \n\n  Meanwhile, he said transition periods from recession to recovery are \"especially risky times\" for policy makers. \"For one thing, they're a time when signals often are quite mixed,\" he said. \"They're also a time when it's natural to be overly pessimistic about the strength of the recovery.\" \n\n  \"This may explain why there have been too many times when policy has eased well after the trough has passed,\" he said. And when the Fed has been overly aggressive in its easing of monetary policy, \"unsustainable growth and eventually painful struggles with inflation\" usually follow, he said. \n\n  Parry emphasized the Fed's role as an inflation fighter, saying that although the Fed \"should facilitate the recovery, (it) cannot lose sight of (its) longer-term goal, which is to control, and ultimately eliminate, inflation.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 10, 1991 15:56 ET (19:56 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897297Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897302Z", "inner_id": 109, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5478, "annotations": [{"id": 4452, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "5FzPcLEmI-", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.281965Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.281971Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 92.258, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "1245d08b-5ff9-4383-bdf1-684c81770c39", "import_id": 211, "last_action": null, "task": 5478, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "First Hawaiian Sees Record Earns Yr; Growth Slows 2nd Half\n\n \n   By Ralph T. King Jr. \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  HONOLULU -DJ- First Hawaiian Inc.'s profit growth in the second half of 1991 won't match the 20 pc clip set in the first six months, but the bank holding company will still post record earnings for the year in part because the mainland's recession hasn't spread to Hawaii, Chairman Walter Dods told Dow Jones. \n\n  Analysts expect First Hawaiian to earn between $19 million and $21 million, or 60 cents to 65 cents per share, in the third period ended Sept.  30, versus $18.5 million, or 60 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Dods would not comment on these projections, but he said quarterly results, to be released Oct. 17, would also be a record. \n\n  He noted that \"anything over 60 cents a share is record,\" adding that the company has 5.1 million more shares outstanding now than at this time last year. For the full year, analysts are looking for $82 million to $85 million, or $2.55 to $2.65 per share, compared with $71.5 million, or $2.45 per share, in 1990. \n\n  Despite a sharp decline in tourist arrivals during the Gulf War, Hawaii's economy will grow 2 pc this year, Dods said. \"In the first quarter, the Japanese stopped coming almost overnight, and that has fully recovered.\" Still, the number of U.S.  mainland visitors continues to lag.  Through July, arrivals are off 5.5 pc, \"but that is catching up each month,\" he said. \n\n  Meanwhile, hotel occupancy is down about 10 pc to a current 79.5 pc. Dods attributed the slump to roughly 3,000 luxury hotel rooms built in the past year or so. Giant resorts are suffering the most, he said, but precise figures on this category are not available. \n\n  In contrast to its mainland brethren, First Hawaiian has few problem real estate loans.  Nonperformers total just 0.62 pc of total loans and leases, up from 0.46 pc last quarter. That is a mere blip compared with the industry average of 5.7 pc, according to Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. \n\n  The low level of problem loans is the result of lending mainly in its own backyard. On a loan portfolio in excess of $4 billion, First Hawaiian has just $73 million in California real estate loans, $7 million of which is nonperforming. \"That helps me sleep,\" Chairman Dods said. \n\n  Unlike California, \"Hawaii's real estate prices, knock on wood, are still holding. But there is a softening on the luxury home and megaresort side,\" he said. The reason for this is that Japanese investor interest has cooled and Japanese banks have pulled back from the Hawaiian market. \n\n  Dods said that First Hawaiian's torrid profit growth will abate in the second half because its net interest margin is under pressure. That's partly because lending rates adjust downwards more quickly than the interest rates banks pay depositors. Further, the bank is trying to increase market share, offering a passbook rate of 5.5 pc, versus the 5 pc rate of its slightly larger chief rival, Bancorp Hawaii. First Hawaiian already has 39 pc of the state's total bank deposits. \n\n  The wave of intrastate mergers currently sweeping the banking industry are driven by the hope of operating cost savings of 35 pc or more. But Dods thinks this expectation is too optimistic, at least at his bank.  Having recently completed the acquisition of First Interstate of Hawaii Inc., First Hawaiian should realize cost savings of just 25 pc, or $12 million annually by 1993, he said. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 14, 1991 09:12 ET (13:12 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897327Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897333Z", "inner_id": 110, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5479, "annotations": [{"id": 4453, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "g-zFquxuM2", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.281996Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282002Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 153.939, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "77ee670f-1f99-4c45-8fa2-0524615278d7", "import_id": 212, "last_action": null, "task": 5479, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "E.

a reduction in the discount rate. \n\n  The Fed's move pushed the discount rate to 4.5% from 5%, where it had stood since Sept.  13. \n\n  The move comes only a week after the Fed eased policy by lowering the Federal Funds rate 25 basis points to 5%, and implies that the Funds rate will be lowered by an additional 25 basis points, analysts say. \n\n  The move was widely anticipated, although the timing caught market participants by surprise, coming as it did in the middle of a Treasury refunding. \n\n  \"I think it's unprecedented,\" to cut the discount after the start of a quarterly refunding, says Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities. \n\n  Nonetheless, \"it should have happened, and is a bit overdue,\" he adds. \n\n  \"This keeps (the Fed) on track toward lower rates, and until there are signs of economic strength, it will continue,\" says Slifer. \n\n  \"The question is whether we're at 4.75% on Funds,\" says Henry Engler, economist at Chemical Bank. \"My guess is that we are.\" \n\n  Almost every policy shift by the Fed under the leadership of Chairman Alan Greenspan has involved a 25-basis-point move in the Funds rate, including last week's move down to 5%. \n\n  Federal Funds currently are changing hands at 4.75%, after opening the day at 5%, prior to the discount rate cut announcement. \n\n  The pace at which the Federal Reserve has instituted policy easings has clearly been increased, reflecting the central bank's growing concern about the economy's ability to sustain its faltering recovery from recession. \n\n  Today's discount rate cut comes only a week after the Fed lowered the Federal Funds target to 5%. Many of the Fed's previous easings had come with intervals of at least a month. \n\n  If, as is widely expected, the Fed's new Fed Funds rate target is 4.75%, \"that gives us 50 basis points in two weeks,\" says Slifer of Lehman.  \"They have speeded up the pace.\" \n\n  Since late summer, when the economy showed signs of rebounding, market participants viewed each easing of monetary policy as the last move the Fed would need to make. \n\n  But that perception has changed, and there is a growing outlook that the easing of policy undertaken today will be followed by other moves toward lower rates. \n\n  \"I think we have more cuts in store,\" adds Slifer. \n\n  He contends that as long as the Fed Funds rate is above the rate of inflation, \"it is not terribly stimulative.\" \n\n  Slifer says the Funds rate could eventually move as low as 3%. \n\n  \"The view that the economic recovery looks a good deal more uncertain is a major contributor\" to the perception that the Fed will have to ease further, says Engler of Chemical Bank. \n\n  But Engler doubts the next move will come imminently. \n\n  \"The Fed will certainly want to adopt a wait-and-see approach\" before easing again, Engler says. \"They'll want to see how the fourth quarter will shape up.\" \n\n  Engler also says there is a potential roadblock to further Fed easing. If \"the fourth quarter continues to come in poorly, there will be a tendency (by the Bush Administration) to move toard fiscal stimulus. That may keep the Fed from doing anything more on the policy front,\" he says. \n\n  The combination of a tax cut with huge budget deficits and an easier monetary policy is widely seen as a sure-fire means of fueling inflation. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 06, 1991 09:34 ET (14:34 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897441Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897446Z", "inner_id": 114, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5483, "annotations": [{"id": 4457, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "mFDT-MRRsZ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282115Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282120Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 263.809, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "e6df76e0-071d-4e6b-9d86-18e2bfd55e35", "import_id": 216, "last_action": null, "task": 5483, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "U.K. Oct.

That compares with September's 0.4 pc monthly fall and 2.9 pc yearly fall and forecasts for a 0.1 pc monthly rise and 2.2 pc year-on-year fall. \n\n  Output prices, excluding food, tobacco and drink, rose 0.2 pc an unadjusted basis in October from September and were up 4.2 pc from a year earlier. \n\n  The statistics office noted that the 4.2 pc rise was the lowest since April 1987, when it also rose 4.2 pc.  The year-on-year rate peaked at 6.5 pc in January and February this year. \n\n  The Treasury welcomed the slowdown in output price inflation, noting that the decline in the year-on-year rate for all manufacturing to 5.2 pc from 5.7 pc in September was the biggest monthly fall observed since March 1986. \n\n  The Treasury suggested that the sharp fall in output price inflation shows that underlying inflation pressure in Britain is continuing to decline.  It added that this should feed through into further reductions in retail price inflation over the coming months. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 12, 1991 07:32 ET (12:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897468Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.897473Z", "inner_id": 115, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5484, "annotations": [{"id": 4458, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "m3Ag6ZqxIL", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282144Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282149Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 190.47899999999998, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "d7640b9b-feec-41c9-86f4-b49817e22813", "import_id": 217, "last_action": null, "task": 5484, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Bundesbank - Inflation -2-: Threatens Growth, Employment\n\n \n\n  FRANKFURT -DJ- In yet another warning to Germany's labor unions, the Deutsche Bundesbank said wage-driven inflation in 1992 could be \"hard to combat and demands all the more harsh retaliation.\" \n\n  \"The few demands for the round of 1992 wage talks that we know about are in the same dimensions as in 1991, although the economic environment - in part because of wage increases - has considerably worsened,\" the German central bank said in its December monthly report. \n\n  \"With the slowing of growth there isn't as much room to distribute (profits) as in there was in the previous two years,\" it added. \n\n  Year-on-year wage growth was around 6.5 pc-7 pc in November, the Bundesbank noted.

Wadsworth Jr., president of Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd., said. \n\n  The size and maturities of NTT's past domestic issues suggest an offering would be in the range of 50 billion yen approaching 10-years. The floatation would introduce \"negotiated fixed-price reoffering\" to Japan's domestic corporate straight-bond issue market. \n\n  Nomura Securities Co. will \"run the book,\" or keep track of the syndication, for NTT's issue. \n\n  In the U.S. and Europe, underwriters check demand before pricing an issue, then offer the issue at one price to all investors for an initial term. \n\n  Currently, in Japan the lead manager bids to the issuer for an offering, then places it at varying prices, often selectively discounted. \n\n  -0- \n\n  The NTT bond issue is also a coup for Morgan Stanley Group's Morgan Stanley & Co. \n\n  \"Up until now it has been hard for us to determine the appropriate price for our bonds,\" said Toyoaki Ukita, senior manager for NTT's finance division. \"The fixed-price method will make things clear.  If that encourages more investors to buy NTT bonds, it will minimize our long-range capital costs.\" \n\n  Morgan Stanley and Nomura will each receive a 30%, or 15 billion yen, share of the offering. Morgan has never had more than a 1% share of a straight Japanese domestic bond issue. \n\n  The success of the issue will be tested as early as Wednesday, when underwriters are expected to begin selling to investors. But longer-term evaluation will depend on whether the bond is traded among investors in the secondary market. \n\n  Other managers in the NTT syndicate include Yamaichi Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co., Kankaku Securities Co., New Japan Securities Co. and Kokusai Securities Co. The 25 other syndicate members with smaller shares include five other foreign securities houses: Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., S.G.  Warburg Securities Japan Inc., Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp., Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.  and Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. \n\n  Because the companies don't discount the bonds, the 0.65 yen commission that underwriters charge for each 100 yen of face value may actually result in greater commission revenue than Japanese securities houses have usually seen from corporate bond underwriting. \n\n  Ukita expressed confidence in the proposed offering's success but acknowledged the risk that investors in Japan may not immediately take to the fixed-price system. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 09, 1991 09:22 ET (14:22 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.907536Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.907561Z", "inner_id": 117, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5486, "annotations": [{"id": 4460, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "WBrXiZT7a3", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282204Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282209Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 111.55, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "75ebabf1-5f21-49a3-8c7e-1b41b85787b1", "import_id": 219, "last_action": null, "task": 5486, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "T.

Excluding food and energy, in 1990 the consumer inflation rate was 5.2 pc and so far this year it has been 3.9 pc - the decline coming as a result of falling energy prices. Boltz says \"unless the economic recovery is much weaker than we anticipate inflation next year should be in the 3 1/2 to 4 pc area.\" \n\n  T. Rowe Price expects that real Gross National Product on a fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter basis will be virtually unchanged this year and will grow about 2 3/4 pc in 1992. \"This would be roughly half the growth of other post-World War II recoveries\", Boltz said. \n\n  Looking forward, \"we believe the sluggish recovery will feel much like a recession through mid-1992. None the less, we think that consumers will gradually emerge from the gloom, as they always do, and the economy will resume more normal growth in the second half of next year,\" the T.

The Brazilian currency has lost 22% of its value against the dollar since the central bank first moved to devalue the real a week ago. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's key Bovespa Index closed 267 points, or 3.8%, higher at 7380 in light trading. \n\n  Stocks have risen thanks in part to bottom fishing by foreign investors as share prices, quoted in dollar terms, traded at deep discounts. Indeed, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. said it was increasing its Brazil position in its model portfolio by unwinding positions in Chile and Peru. Stocks also rose on anticipation of congressional passage of an important pension-reform bill today. \n\n  Late Monday, Brazil's monetary policy committee raised the ceiling on benchmark interest rates to 41% from 36%. The central bank immediately backed up that move, lending overnight funds to banks at 32% yesterday, up from 29.8% Monday. Futures markets indicate rates could soon shoot up to 39%, near the 39.75% rate at which the Treasury sold one-year paper yesterday. Brazilian consumers pay annual interest rates of more than 100%. \n\n  The rate increase made good on Finance Minister Pedro Malan's promise earlier Monday that Brazil would defend its currency with higher rates -- at least for the short term. That action was supported by the International Monetary Fund and encouraged by Brazilian economists who feared President Fernando Henrique Cardoso might try to drop rates precipitously to gain political points with Brazil's badly bruised business establishment. \n\n  Mr. Malan is expected to elaborate on his policy plans today at a breakfast hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among the commercial and investment bankers expected to attend are senior executives from Citigroup Inc., Chase Manhattan Corp., J.P. Morgan & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. \n\n  Because of a fat budget deficit, Brazil has external borrowing requirements estimated at more than $55 billion this year and needs to maintain rates attractive enough to coax that money from beyond its borders. Yet dollars keep leaving the country, even after the central bank said Friday it would stop spending its own hard currency cache to support the real. \n\n  Since then, dollar outflows are on a pace to average about $6.5 billion a month -- enough to wipe out Brazil's current dollar reserves by August (not including future disbursements from the remaining $32.5 billion in bailout funds available from the IMF and other lenders). \n\n  It isn't unusual for a country to raise interest rates following a currency devaluation in order to stem an outflow of hard currency. In Brazil's case, higher rates also represent a badly needed bridge between the shock of a change in exchange-rate policy and the so-far elusive return of investor confidence. Investors say the only way Brazil can shore up confidence is by delivering badly needed fiscal reforms. \n\n  Yesterday, Brazil's Senate voted as expected to increase and extend a tax on banking transactions -- a cornerstone of budget savings promised the IMF. That measure still needs to be approved in the lower house of Congress, where Mr. Cardoso has faced the most legislative resistance to reform. \n\n  A far greater test comes today, when Congress is scheduled to vote on a controversial measure to begin taxing retirees to shore up a bankrupt pension system. That measure has failed four times during the past four years, and an administration victory would be worth a lot more than the planned $2.6 billion in budgeted savings this year. \n\n  \"The importance of this vote for investor confidence and the real is hard to overstate,\" said Mauro Schneider, economist for ING Barings in Sao Paulo. Most analysts believe the government has the votes to pass the measure and will then aim to pass enabling legislation allowing states to reduce their bloated payrolls. \n\n  With such reforms under his belt, Mr. Cardoso will come under intense political and fiscal pressure to lower interest rates over the medium term. Not only do high rates tighten the stranglehold on the economy, but they also build on the government's massive domestic debt -- two thirds of which is indexed to interest rates. \"I think the pressure to lower interest rates will come more from the fiscal end than from the political end,\" said Jair Ribeiro, managing director of Banco Patrimonio de Investimento SA in Sao Paulo. \n\n  Officials here have said unofficially they hope to be able to drop overnight rates to below 20% by the end of March. Buttonholed by reporters, Central Bank President Franciso Lopes said the latest rate increase is only meant to be temporary. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 19, 1999 20:10 ET (01:10 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.907828Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.907839Z", "inner_id": 121, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5490, "annotations": [{"id": 5134, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "RBQGSIPK0v", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-22T18:35:52.344131Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-22T18:35:52.344157Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 68.724, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "67b82eb3-5b80-4406-9853-1f30bd3c20ea", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5490, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "NZ Birch Sees Favorable Exchange/Interest Rate Mix Remaining\n\n \n\n  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--New Zealand Treasurer Bill Birch said Tuesday the current mix of the New Zealand dollar exchange rate and interest rates appears likely to remain favorable for \"some time\" ahead. \n\n  Birch, in an economic briefing to New Zealand-based law firm Chapman Tripp, said lower interest rates and a lower currency exchange rate are the key factors behind a recovery in the New Zealand economy. \n\n  \"The mix of exchange and interest rates appears favorable for some time ahead.

But he said it must be cooled a little to ensure continued growth. \n\n  'Through the end of 1998, the economy continued to grow more rapidly than can be currently accommodated on an ongoing basis,' Greenspan said in prepared remarks. As a result 'some moderation in economic growth...might be required to sustain the expansion.' \n\n  The U.S. economy is expected to have grown at a 3.75% rate in 1998, resulting in the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history. That performance, bolstered by three Fed rate cuts, has stirred many Fed policy makers to warn that the growth could stoke inflation. Most economists, as a result, no longer expect the Fed to cut rates again this year. \n\n  Greenspan's testimony reinforced those expectations. Appearing before a Congressional committee for the first time since September, Greenspan said economic growth has shrunk the supply of U.S. workers willing to work who don't have jobs, a trend that could push labor costs up. Moreover, he said, the rise of U.S. stocks in recent months, which has contributed to economic growth, may be unsustainable. \n\n  'Everything he said suggested the Fed is going to be on hold for the remainder of the year,' said Josh Feinman, an economist with Bankers Trust in New York. 'The Fed has a pretty even balance of risks going forward: With the economy strong and financial markets stabilizing, the Fed wouldn't dream of easing (interest rates).

The company's chief executive officer works at a makeshift desk assembled from a plywood door and some metal brackets. Losses last year topped $100 million, and top officials warn of more red ink this year. \n\n  If you think those traits make Amazon a stock-market flop, guess again. Last year Amazon shares surged 966%, the most of any of the 1,000 companies tracked in The Wall Street Journal's Shareholder Scoreboard. An investment of just $1,000 at the end of 1997 would have ballooned to $10,664 12 months later. Along the way, Amazon has become the archetype of an Internet success story: a company willing to post hefty losses while it achieves explosive growth in the brave new world of electronic commerce. \n\n  By the end of last year, more than six million people had visited Amazon's Web site and purchased books, music or videos. With a few clicks of a computer mouse, they picked out their favorites and then typed in their credit-card numbers as payment. Those orders whizzed into Amazon's warehouses, which then shipped the goods via mail or private shippers. All of a sudden, consumers had a new way to shop, without ever leaving the house or talking to a sales clerk. \n\n  For Jeffrey Bezos, Amazon's CEO, 1998 was the year his five-year-old way of doing business went from a minor high-tech curiosity to a part of mainstream American culture. \"Last year was all about comfort and familiarity,\" he says. \"People realized that shopping online wasn't just a novelty. It was a way of saving time and saving money.\" \n\n  Amazon's most explosive growth came just before Christmas, when stressed-out shoppers decided that point-and-click at their home computers was a lot more fun than pushing and elbowing at the mall. \"It was a very good period for people to try us for the first time,\" Mr. Bezos says. Amazon achieved nearly 40% of its 1998 sales in the fourth quarter, as business nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier pace. \n\n  In most other industries, investor enthusiasm about Amazon's soaring sales would be tempered by severe worries about profitability. Bookselling in general is a low-margin business, as big merchants compete largely by offering customers sizable discounts to list price. Amazon opted to keep its prices low so it could pull in customers. That left little cushion to cover its overhead or massive marketing spending aimed at drawing new customers. \n\n  As an Internet-commerce play, however, Amazon has enjoyed wide leeway from investors to run up losses in the name of building sales and brand recognition. The opportunities to grab a commanding lead in cyberspace are too big to be passed up in the name of a short-term focus on profits, says Henry Blodget, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. \"I don't think {Amazon} will turn profitable until 2001 -- and they're right to do it that way,\" he says. \n\n  Skeptics argue that Amazon's losses may have no clear end in sight. Although Amazon was the first online bookstore, it now has dozens of rivals, including heavyweights such as Barnes & Noble Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Meanwhile, a relative newcomer, Buy.com Inc., has vowed to undercut Amazon's prices on all titles. \n\n  So far, Amazon has kept its dominant position in online bookselling while sales have grown rapidly in newer markets such as music, videos and overseas markets. But operating margins in those new sectors are even slimmer than in the domestic book market. Looking ahead, Amazon says it wants to offer customers an even wider range of goods online; it won't say whether it will make acquisitions or merely provide electronic links to other merchants. \n\n  At the very least, Amazon has bought a lot more time to continue its experiments. In January, the company sold $1.25 billion of convertible bonds at a trifling interest rate of 4.75%. That gives it a formidable cash hoard to cover operating losses, expansions and any acquisitions for years to come. \n\n  Amazon also may be on the brink of a major efficiency improvement by upgrading its warehouses and distribution, says Steve Horen, an analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. A highly automated warehouse in Nevada is due to open this summer, he notes. By contrast, Amazon's Seattle warehouse requires employees to find each book ordered and pull it off a shelf. Paring down labor costs could bring Amazon much closer to profitability, Mr. Horen says. \n\n  What's more, Amazon's ability to do business in cyberspace lets it grow rapidly without tying up much cash. Its chief financial officer, Joy Covey, recently calculated that the company so far has spent just $36 million on physical assets. By contrast, if it were running physical stores, she says, it would have spent $650 million on leases for at least 200 facilities to achieve the same level of sales. \n\n  As Amazon pursues more growth, it is almost impossible to gauge whether the company has any hope of delivering welcome surprises to shareholders, given how much its stock already has surged. At current prices, Amazon is valued at 24 times annual sales, whereas rival Barnes & Noble sells at just twice its annual sales. \n\n  In a recent conference call with investors and analysts, Amazon's Mr. Bezos urged investors to make Amazon only a small part of their holdings and to focus on the company's long-term prospects rather than look for a quick killing in the stock. The company's growth so far has created \"high expectations,\" Mr. Bezos says. \"Every investment we make won't pay off as strongly as they have historically.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 24, 1999 23:35 ET (04:35 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908161Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-22T18:56:35.103803Z", "inner_id": 127, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5496, "annotations": [{"id": 5189, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "SRwNGAkjr3", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-24T14:00:44.753794Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T14:00:44.753820Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 1021.416, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "720814ba-606e-43bf-a6f9-8e7ea0a48840", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5496, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Confidence In NZ Real Estate Mkt Reaches New High - ASB Bk\n\n \n \n\n  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Confidence in New Zealand's real estate market has climbed to a record high in the three months ended Jan. 31, according to a survey by ASB Bank. \n\n  The ASB housing confidence indicator showed a net 71% of respondents think it is a good time to buy a house, up from 52% with that view in the previous quarter ended Oct. 31.

Phelps \n\n  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Thursday's Wall Street Journal. Mr. Phelps is a professor of economics at Columbia University). \n\n \n\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Meeting last month in Bonn, finance ministers of the Group of Seven countries discussed ways in which greater regulation of international financial flows could ease the plight of nations hard hit by the global economic turmoil. There's a better way to help: Induce the nations in crisis to reform their economies on the capitalist model, drop government involvement in the direction of \"development\" and establish acceptable standards of information reporting. Such steps would ensure that in the future these nations are less of a danger to themselves and others in the global economy. \n\n  The G-7's approach and the one I suggest reflect the opposing perspectives of the world's two main surviving economic systems: capitalism, in which every would-be entrepreneur is free to enter the market and compete without favoritism, and corporatism, in which private corporate interests are reconciled and coordinated by the central government. The first is pluralistic, open; the other is cooperative, run by insiders, Today, several economies in East Asia are informally corporatist, Russia and China seem increasingly so, and parts of Europe and Latin America have not wholly shed their corporatist ways. \n\n  Corporatist leaders have attempted to deflect attention from the recent malfunction of their system by blaming capitalism and calling for its restraint. They impute the series of crises to the system's financial center, which, they say, directs huge movements of capital in and out of the periphery -- Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America -- at the drop of a hat. A few Western economists and financiers seem to agree, as do Europe's center-left politicians. \n\n  But attributing the sharp moves in financial flows to the erratic \"push\" of capital from the center doesn't fit the facts. The push thesis fails to explain why in the 1990s huge capital flows went into east Asia while little went to Latin America and nothing to Africa. The thesis also leaves unexplained why within east Asia the more corporatist economies -- South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia -- were the big takers. (Noncorporatist Taiwan and the Philippines experienced more modest inflows and suffered only from the ensuing financial contagion.) \n\n  A better explanation for the crisis is the \"pull\" thesis. According to this view, the crisis had its roots in the big domestic firms' rosy expectations about the future returns on their investments and the future interest rates on their loans -- expectations that would not materialize if everyone acted on them at once. Similarly, domestic banks had unrealistic expectations about the capacity of the government to make good its implicit guarantee on loans that went bad. What followed was domestic asset-price inflation, particularly in the prices of nontradable capital goods, which drove the production of those goods above its equilibrium path -- and the economy's total employment above its equilibrium path. \n\n  Once these expectations came to be seen as unrealizable, the bubble of inflated asset prices burst. Prices had to drop at least to the path that would have prevailed had the bubble never gotten started -- and employment had to fall similarly. However, the boom created structural imbalances that forced asset prices to sink far below where they were when the bubble began -- and this reversal in turn drove employment into a structural slump. The typical corporatist economy had overinvested in export capacity, thus depressing export prices. It had also invested unwisely, picking too many losers. Its workers, richer from the extra earnings of the boom, would not accept prebubble wage rates absent a slump. Its banks became paralyzed by the overhang of bad loans. And the government's incompetence cost it the confidence of investors, \n\n  To be sure, capitalist economies, like corporatist ones, can lose their equilibrium -- witness the American bubble of the 1920s. It is in the nature of capitalism that rational lenders and shareholders take chances on less than complete information; they know they cannot tap into an entrepreneur's private knowledge and intentions. It is in the nature of corporatism, though, to get into a large and protracted disequilibrium, resulting in larger and larger structural imbalances. \n\n  First, the corporatists shielded their bubble from second opinions by denying lenders and share buyers access to extensive and timely information. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer told The Wall Street Journal Americas conference last fall that he had talked to Western bankers who clearly knew nothing about some of the Asian countries in which they were lending. If the actual situation had not been so obscure, new lenders would have been far more cautious, and old loans would have been called in sooner. \n\n  Second, the corporatist economy is disequilibrium -- prone because it steers capital to industries and firms viewed as prospective winners -- while capitalists bet on diverse and even incompatible visions. And since there are limits to how much economic knowledge the government can muster in making its choices, it tends to narrow the scope of development to a small number of industries. It was characteristic of the booms in the corporatist economies that they were concentrated in real estate, chemicals, steel, cars, microchips and a few other sectors. I suspect that the upward pressure on wage rates as workers became more comfortable over the years also played a part. To keep prosperity going in the face of rising labor costs, the corporatists fueled an investment boom to stimulate the demand for labor. \n\n  If this is the main story behind the recent turmoil, it constitutes a crisis of corporatism, not a crisis of capitalism. That seems to be the lesson drawn by Singapore, which has said it is opening its doors to more foreign investment and loosening restrictions to attract more overseas firms to locate there. And this suggests that the G-7's concern over financial flows is misplaced. It is national governments, not financial flows, that ought to be monitored, to check that they have reformed themselves along capitalist lines and are enforcing acceptable rules of conduct in their economies. \n\n  Students look shocked when told advanced capitalist countries have a right to demand of another country that it reform itself in their image. Yet in our business with other parties we demand they behave in a certain way if they want us to be their customer or employee or lender. And, not uncommonly, good guys gang up to require everyone else to meet their standards in order to obtain the general good. \n\n  Another reform is to start a private agency to gather information of interest to lenders and investors on emerging markets and disseminate it to subscribing Western banks and investment funds. So far neither the International Monetary Fund nor the private credit-rating agencies can be counted on to do this, as they maintain close ties to foreign corporatist governments. Yet the importance -- and the influence -- of such an agency cannot be understated. A large bank would be uncomfortable not subscribing, as it would be a conspicuous failure to exercise diligence in its lending. And an emerging-market economy would think twice about refusing to provide information, since doing so would risk a pullout by Western lenders and investors. \n\n  What the emerging-market nations need now is more capitalism, not less. The West will be right to demand that the so-called emerging market nations adopt the capitalist model for their own benefit and that of all members of the global economy. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 25, 1999 02:46 ET (07:46 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908386Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:00:17.633957Z", "inner_id": 131, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5500, "annotations": [{"id": 5211, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "0z1c7HHscI", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-24T15:00:53.828524Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T13:08:19.178108Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 97.425, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f455a9f0-81cb-4fb4-8243-4988a8d36aeb", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5500, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "U.S. Tsys -2: Investors On Edge Ahead Of NAPM, Payrolls\n\n \n \n\n  Treasurys stayed near their intraday lows for most of the session.

Vowing to topple Mahuad, they are calling for street protests and bank occupations on Wednesday. Business leaders are furious at having their dollar accounts frozen. \n\n  But so far, most Ecuadoreans -already among the poorest in Latin America- remain stunned. Violent protests have been limited. \n\n  With banks scheduled to reopen Monday after being closed for a week, people are anxious to see what the financial future holds. \n\n  \"I pray this signals a turn away from populism and easy solutions,\" Ecuadorean economist Jose Samaniego said. \"Because what we were doing before was the road to self-destruction.\" \n\n  Past presidents have shamelessly doled out political patronage and cut deals with parties in Congress in order to pass laws, repeatedly approving deficit budgets and rejecting necessary but unpopular measures. \n\n  From small shopkeepers to factory owners, few in Ecuador pay taxes and no president had been willing to crack down on evaders. The government estimates that 80 percent of taxes are not paid. \n\n  As a result, Ecuador's budget deficit has ballooned to $1.2 billion and its national debt stands at $16 billion. \n\n  \"The roots of Ecuador's crisis are political,\" said former Vice President Blasco Penaherrera. \"For more than 20 years, with only a few very brief respites, we have not had serious government.\" \n\n   Banana And Oil Export Revenues Collapse \n\n  While many of its Latin American neighbors privatized their state industries and opened markets to competition years ago, Ecuador has lagged behind, its economy propped up by oil and banana exports. \n\n  As long as its leaders could spread oil and banana money to the military and political elites, no president dared buck the system, Penaherrera said. \n\n  But when El Nino-driven floods devastated banana production last year and world oil prices fell, Ecuador entered what Mahuad called its \"worst economic crisis in 70 years.\" \n\n  With the patronage system disrupted, economists say Mahuad, a political centrist with a master's degree in public administration from Harvard, has a unique opportunity to create a modern, free-market state. \n\n  But experts fear politics may doom the effort. \n\n  Many key reforms must be approved by Congress, which can veto presidential legislation. Mahuad's party lacks a majority and the main parties have announced their opposition to the austerity measures. \n\n  \"Mahuad doesn't have the support he needs in Congress to pass the reforms. I doubt that he can do it,\" Penaherrera said. \n\n  Among his supporters, there are growing calls for Mahuad to bypass the discredited Congress and rule by decree. \n\n  Since few presidents have held a majority in Congress, they have been forced to make deals with factions within the legislature to be able to govern. \n\n  \"For years, Congress has prevented effective government and blocked Ecuador's development,\" Penaherrera said. \n\n  Congressmen have engaged in fistfights, hurled glass ashtrays and even threatened to urinate on each other during sessions. \n\n  \"We've had the worst politicians in the world,\" said 24-year-old newspaper vendor Aldo Guzman. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 14, 1999 17:26 ET (22:26 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908498Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:35:21.190341Z", "inner_id": 133, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5502, "annotations": [{"id": 5213, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "Lq_AWrv5T_", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-24T15:36:35.976891Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:36:35.976917Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 74.061, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "9cf16d3a-cada-49f4-92fc-74d6d0380442", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5502, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Nymex Close: Calif. Gasoline Surge Boosts Oil Complex\n\n \n \n\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A desperate gasoline supply picture on the U.S. West Coast popped gasoline futures higher at the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, as East Coast traders worried about gasoline supply heading away from them and to the California market. \n\n  California Air Resources Board, or CARB, gasoline prices have shot up 45 cents a gallon to 80 cents in Los Angeles in the month since the closure of Tosco Corp.'s Avon refinery. Also in that time, Exxon Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. shut down fluid catalytic crackers, which produce gasoline, in Benicia and Carson, Calif. \n\n  Brokers in the San Francisco Bay Area, where prices traded around 90 cents a gallon Monday, said the region is virtually without supply. \n\n  April gasoline futures on Nymex settled 178 points higher at 49.42 cents a gallon, after hitting a high of 49.50 cents. April heating oil futures ended 170 points up at 42.39 cents a gallon. April oil, which expired at the end of the session, climbed 26 cents to $15.50 a barrel, while May ended 38 cents higher at $15.74. \n\n  Supply problems on the West Coast don't typically affect gasoline prices in the New York Harbor, which underlie Nymex gasoline futures. But such an extreme supply pinch coupled with indications that overall U.S. gasoline demand is rising had traders edgy. \n\n  \"There's some fear in the market that we'll see gasoline heading to the West Coast as gasoline demand strengthens on the East Coast,\" said Jason Chartrand, an energy analyst with GSC Energy in Atlanta. \n\n  In the week ended March 12, gasoline demand was a strong 8.8 million barrels a day, according to the American Petroleum Institute, at a time of year when gasoline demand is usually soft. At the same time, U.S. gasoline supply fell nearly 7 million barrels to 226.219 million barrels. \n\n  The refinery closures also had a bullish effect on diesel fuel prices, which sparked buying in heating oil futures. Diesel fuel and heating oil are distillates, and can have an effect on each other, a trader said. \n\n  Some analysts were skeptical of problems in California affecting the Nymex. And some warned that the market may rethink the gasoline run-up on Tuesday. \n\n  Surprisingly, the excitement in the products pits occurred on a day when OPEC and production cuts were supposed to be the focus of attention. But little earth-shattering news came from Vienna, where OPEC ministers are gathering ahead of Tuesday's full ministerial meeting, which should see ratification of an output cut of over 2 million barrels a day. \n\n  OPEC president and Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said Monday that total cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will exceed 2.1 million barrels a day. That figure is in line with what most analysts are expecting. \n\n  Most analysts think the cut agreement has been factored into prices, and the market could be set for a correction once the final headline from Vienna is written. \"That'll be a big unknown out of the way, and we can then get back to reality,\" one said. \n\n  But, the situation in California is likely to be considered in any sell-off this week. \n\n  The market shrugged off news Sunday that oil flow had stopped on Iraq-Turkey pipeline due to an explosion on a Turkish part of the line. Monday, the U.N. said oil resumed flowing on the line \n\n  The incident may have been an act of sabotage by the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, an autonomy-seeking terrorist organization that has attacked sites within Turkey, but officials wouldn't comment on the source of the explosion. \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 22, 1999 16:17 ET (21:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908556Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:36:36.206046Z", "inner_id": 134, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5503, "annotations": [{"id": 4465, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "8lbFfzxvx-", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282350Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282356Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 207.48, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "1120dd7f-56de-4b9c-b350-18f2275a1a4b", "import_id": 308, "last_action": null, "task": 5503, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "FX Asia: High Oil Price Impact On Exchange Rates Downplayed\n\n \n \n     By Tom Holland \n \n\n  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Far from being the disaster for Asia that some market players imagine it to be, this month's 27% rise in the price of oil will have no more than a small impact on Asian economies and currencies. \n\n  As officials and ministers from oil producing countries meet in Vienna on Tuesday to ratify an agreement to cut production by over 2 million barrels a day, some foreign exchange traders in Asia are citing the pact as reason to buy U.S. dollars against Asian currencies, particularly the yen. \n\n  But although the foreign exchange market may respond to the production cut with its customary kneejerk reaction, according to economists at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, there is little fundamental reason why a higher oil price should translate into a weaker yen. \n\n  \"The notion that Japan is a huge oil importer is an outdated idea,\" declares Robert Feldman, Morgan Stanley's chief economist in Tokyo. \n\n  Since 1982, when crude oil imports made up 38% of Japan's total imports, the importance of oil to the Japanese economy has fallen drastically. Today, says Feldman, crude oil accounts for just 8% of Japan's imports, eclipsed by alternative energy sources including nuclear power and liquid natural gas. \n\n  And although at its current price of $15.50 per barrel, the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate blend is up a massive 50% from its 12 year low of $10.35 hit in December, the price has merely regained levels last seen in October. \n\n \n   Yen Price Of Oil Down By 3% \n \n\n  Overall, in U.S. dollar terms, the price is just 18% above last year's average. In yen terms, however, the price of the oil imported by Japan has actually fallen. Because of the rise in the value of the Japanese currency in the third quarter of last year, from a Japanese perspective, the oil price has dropped by around 3% from last year's average, argues Feldman. \n\n  With Japanese oil imports worth around Y3 trillion in 1998, a 3% fall in the oil price represents a saving of about Y90 billion. Put into the context of Japan's Y500 trillion gross domestic product, the impact is negligible. \n\n  \"In short, there is no effect,\" says Feldman. \n\n  The impact on other Asian countries and currencies is also likely to be subdued, says Morgan Stanley. \n\n  According to Tim Condon, the firm's Hong Kong-based Southeast Asian economist, Malaysia and Indonesia, as net oil exporters, will benefit from any sustained rise in the oil price. \n\n  Each country will see its current account move further into surplus and there will a small boost to GDP in 1999. GDP shrinkage in Indonesia will be limited to around 3.6% compared with previous estimates of 4.0%. Malaysia will grow by around 2.0%, compared with 1.8% in the absence of the oil price rise. \n\n  Among other regional countries, Singapore, with a roughly balanced oil account, will see little or no net effect. Korea and the Philippines, as oil importers, will see some contraction of their trade surpluses, and slightly slower growth than would have been expected otherwise. \n\n  Most at risk from any extended oil price rise would be India, which already a running a sizable $15 billion trade deficit. \n\n  \"The extent to which currencies are vulnerable to external shocks such as higher oil prices depends on the size of their current account surpluses or deficits and the extent of over or under-valuation of currencies,\" wrote Condon in a research paper published on March 16. \n\n  \"The Indian rupee may be vulnerable to pressure from a wider current account deficit. But for the rest of the region, the small narrowing of trade surpluses would be unlikely to result in serious pressure on their currencies.\" \n\n  -By Tom Holland; 65 421 4808 tom.holland@cor.dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 22, 1999 23:20 ET (04:20 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908625Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908636Z", "inner_id": 135, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5504, "annotations": [{"id": 5214, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "i8yDusonNd", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-24T15:37:43.053208Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:37:43.053234Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 66.117, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3ea1c042-f2e7-439b-9b74-2410fd9bf8a2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5504, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Ecuador Wins Preliminary Agreement For $900M Loan Package\n\n \n\n  By Michael M. Phillips \n\n  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Cash-strapped Ecuador secured preliminary agreement Friday on a $900 million international loan package to help it escape a severe economic and financial crisis. \n\n  The deal will include $500 million from the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and Andean Development Corp. (ADCC) to help the government restructure or close troubled banks. The International Monetary Fund committed to provide its own large 18-month loan, worth an estimated $400 million. \n\n  In addition, the development banks plan to disburse $500 million this year for ongoing projects in Ecuador, bringing the total flow of aid to $1.4 billion. \n\n  The heads of the IMF, IDB and World Bank joined Finance Minister Ana Lucia in a display of support obviously intended to calm financial markets and generate political support for reform in Ecuador. \n\n  \"We applaud and admire the government's efforts,\" IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told reporters. \n\n  The small oil-producing country has been hit by a combination of low oil prices, international and domestic financial turmoil, and political stalemate. President Jamil Mahuad's austerity campaign has generated intense opposition from the legislature, as well as upheaval in the streets. \n\n  Key to winning IMF support was the fact that the government finally convinced Congress this month to adopt tax increases and spending cuts expected to slash the budget deficit this year to about 4% of Gross Domestic Product from about 8%. In addition, international auditors will begin work Monday trying to assess which of the country's 36 banks should be restructured or closed, a process likely to cost billions of dollars. \n\n  Stanley Fischer, the IMF's No. 2, is traveling to Quito next week to discuss the need for reforms, and the IMF expects to formalize an agreement by the end of May. With IMF board approval expected in June, Ecuador will be able to meet July 5 with the Paris Club of creditor governments to seek restructuring of some $800 million in debt. \n\n  Minister Armijos described Friday's announcement as a \"show of the international community's immense support for Ecuador's progress.\" \n\n  -Michael Phillips (201) 938-5099 \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 30, 1999 10:58 ET (14:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908682Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:37:43.279718Z", "inner_id": 136, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5505, "annotations": [{"id": 5215, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "W3G-aeTBK5", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-24T15:38:00.461211Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-24T15:38:00.461235Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 16.474, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "93fd235a-45eb-412f-8a41-69abccb484ac", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5505, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Mexico/Pemex/March -2: Nat Gas Prod 4.768 BCF/D\n\n \n \n\n  MEXICO CITY (Dow Jones)--Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos (E.PEM) exported an average of 1.64 million barrels a day of crude oil in March at an average price of $10.79 a barrel. \n\n  According to statistics released Monday, Pemex crude output in March totaled 3.05 million b/d, up from 3.02 million b/d in February. \n\n  Heavy Maya crude output averaged 1.659 million b/d, while light Isthmus output averaged 846,000 b/d and super light Olmeca production averaged 548,000 b/d. \n\n  Of March crude exports, 1.417 million b/d went to the Americas, 121,000 b/d went to Europe and 59,000 b/d went to Asia and other regions. \n\n  Exports of Maya crude averaged 1.021 million b/d, exports of Isthmus averaged 169,000 b/d and exports of Olmeca averaged 450,000 b/d. \n\n  Pemex said its natural gas production in March averaged 4.768 billion cubic feet a day, down from 4.787 Bcf/d in February. \n\n  The $10.79-per-barrel average crude price for March is the highest monthly average price since September 1998.

While Ecuador's government is forecasting economic growth of between 1.5% and 2.0% this year, economists are predicting a contraction of between 2% and 10%. Inflation projections range from 40% to 170%, against the government's estimate of 36%. \n\n  With gross domestic product expanding a minuscule 0.8% last year as it battled the weather phenomenon El Nino and low commodities prices, analysts say the tiny Andean country is just setting out to solve its fiscal and economic problems. \n\n  This year a chaotic currency devaluation, a one-week closure of banks, the freezing of almost half of all bank deposits, nationwide strikes and increasing political squabbles between the government and opposition parties have fueled an ongoing deterioration. \n\n  Vowing to halve the country's ballooning fiscal deficit to 3.5% of GDP, President Jamil Mahuad last Friday forwarded to Congress a raft of tax and cost-cutting measures that lawmakers are expected to start debating next week. That's not enough, according to many economists. \n\n  \"Even if the package is approved by Congress, we believe the 1999 deficit will again overshoot by a significant margin as a result of unplanned currency weakness and a sharp contraction of the economy,\" says Graham Stock, vice president of international fixed-income research at Chase Securities Inc., which is forecasting a 10% GDP contraction. \n\n  Many see the pending measures in Congress as only offering short-term economic relief, with the government needing to attack fundamental problems to create medium and long-term stability. \n\n  \"Currently, Ecuador has a credibility problem,\" says Ramon Aracena, senior Latin American economist at the Institute of International Finance, or IIF, which represents many of the world's largest banks and investment funds. \n\n  \"Once credibility is restored, the pressure on the currency and interest rates will be alleviated,\" predicts Aracena, who expects GDP to contract 2%, on the optimistic end of economists' forecasts. \n\n \n   Banks, Political Opposition Are Twin Challenges \n \n\n  Jose M. Barrionuevo, a global strategist at Lehman Brothers, says the government fiscal program could become the first baby step toward a slow economic recovery, but only \"if those reforms are approved with urgency by Congress and if combined with a decisive program of bank restructuring.\" \n\n  Barrionuevo is forecasting a GDP contraction of 4% and inflation of 50% \"in the most conservative scenario, where the government manages to skip a deteriorating political dispute.\" \n\n  According to Chase's Stock, the road to recovery turns tougher since some of the measures seem unrealistic. \n\n  \"Oil prices assumptions are all right today, but they're not guaranteed to stay as high; while the assumed funding from debt renegotiations don't seem viable,\" he says. \n\n  But investors' immediate concerns surround the banking sector's frailty, highlighted by this month's collapse of the second-largest bank - Banco del Progreso - and the political gridlock that is sapping any residual support for Mahuad's administration, which assumed power last August. \n\n  \"Banks are in an extremely delicate situation,\" says IIF's Aracena. \"They need some sort of chemotherapy to cure their health and that will take years. But the important thing is for them to start the treatment.\" \n\n  Bruised by continuous pressure on the local currency, the government on Feb. 12 decided to abandon the sucre's trading band and let it float freely. While that helped staunch the bleeding of reserves, it prompted a run on bank deposits and introduced extraordinary volatility in the foreign exchange market - most of it downward. \n\n  The sucre closed Wednesday at a mid rate of 10,250 per dollar, after plunging as far as ECS17,000 in intraday trading March 5 - a 74% depreciation from the end of 1998. U.S. analysts predict the exchange rate will average between ECS10,500/dollar and ECS14,000/dollar in 1999, against a government projection of ECS7,460 before the devaluation. \n\n  After shooting up to 180% earlier this year, interest rates have fallen since the sucre's devaluation - but were still at 94% Wednesday, keeping pressure on the banking sector. \n\n  On the legislative front, tax reforms and new laws that will help the administration streamline the public sector and reduce public spending are vigorously opposed by the Social Christians, the country's main opposition party. \n\n  \"The main barriers to sound fiscal policy in Ecuador are the relationship between the executive and Congress, and the difficult process for decision-making in Congress due to the large number of parties, each with its own agenda,\" says Santiago Millan, Latin American analyst at New York-based research firm I.D.E.A.. Millan expects the Ecuadorean economy to shrink by 5% in 1999. \n\n \n   IMF Aid No Sure Thing; Debt Default Not Ruled Out \n \n\n  Earlier in March the government seemed to have reached a pact with opposition parties to scale back gasoline price hikes in return for opposition support of new tax measures. But after two parties threatened to pull out of the accord unless the government cut fuel prices further, the executive has beeen scrambling to build a new alliance. \n\n  \"The subsequent delays in turning to economic matters, presumably in the search of a consensus, that never emerged, mean that the fiscal position is worse than ever, and the ongoing recession has reduced tolerance for economic discipline,\" says Chase's Stock. \n\n  Under these circumstances, economists say it's hard to envision a prompt agreement with the International Monetary Fund. An IMF mission has been in Ecuador for several weeks in an effort to hammer out an 18-month, $400-million standby credit facility. \n\n  \"Over the next few months we expect to hear words of encouragement from the Fund for the banking sector reform and fiscal adjustment, but proper negotiations look unlikely before the second half of the year at the earliest,\" says Stock. \n\n  A delay in reaching a deal with the IMF would translate into a similar delay in negotiations with the Paris Club, as Ecuador seeks to refinance about $400 million in capital and interest arrears from $1.3 billion in bilateral debt. The country's external debt totals $15.245 billion and its service equals about 41% of the budget. \n\n  \"The country's debt burden takes up considerable space in the budget...this is obviously the unfortunate result of an inefficient process of fiscal policy that through the years led to a large accumulation of foreign debt,\" says I.D.E.A.'s Millan. \n\n  Millan pegs Ecuador's current external debt to GDP ratio at 75.3%, more than double the Latin American average of 35%. \n\n  Faced with a bloated deficit and growing popular discontent, analysts don't rule out the possibility that either this administration or any successor might default on sovereign debt. \n\n  \"One day the finance ministry will be faced with a tough choice between missing another month's salary for nurses and teachers or skipping a coupon payment to foreign investors,\" says Chase's Stock. \"It's a choice I wouldn't want to make, but I think the sympathies of most Ecuadoreans will be very clear.\" \n\n-By Enza Tedesco; 201-9382203; enza.tedesco@dowjones.com; \n(Mercedes Alvaro in Quito contributed to this article) \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 01, 1999 15:05 ET (20:05 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.908912Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:09:50.608710Z", "inner_id": 140, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5509, "annotations": [{"id": 5405, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "Kbdq44CcJx", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:10:07.203315Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:10:07.203328Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 15.875, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5650619a-d24e-463d-8649-8ccbf079e673", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5509, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "NZ Bonds Slightly Weaker In Morning But Tone Well Bid\n\n \n \n\n  WELLINGTON-(Dow Jones)--New Zealand bond prices are lower Wednesday, but the local market has a bid tone with buying seen mainly in the longer-dated maturities, especially the five-year bond. \n\n  \"Bond yields are seen as being near the upper edge of their recent range and some people regard these levels as a good entry point,\" said a bond trader at a commercial bank. \n\n  \"There has been more of a selloff in U.S. bonds overnight but we haven't gone with it fully,\" he said. \n\n  The 7% July 2009 bond yield is unchanged from its opening level of 5.95% Wednesday.

Australia's economy grew 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 1998, or 4.7% of GDP year-on-year. First-quarter GDP data are due out June 2. \n\n  Given external reasons for the country's large current account deficit, Richard Yetsenga, senior economist with Deutsche Bank in Australia, doesn't expect investors to run away from Australian investments, though the Australian dollar \"might wobble a little bit\" on Tuesday's data.

The rioting that swept the country last year - and forced former President Suharto's resignation - remained fresh in people's minds, and the assumption was that politics, combined with simmering ethnic and religious tensions, would set off another round of unrest during the campaign. Foreign-investment approvals plunged nearly 90% in the first 10 weeks of 1999, compared with the year earlier. \n\n  But the euphoric three-week campaign period ended up looking more like a rock concert than a war zone - large-scale unrest never materialized. Monday's voting was calm and orderly. \n\n  Financial markets responded. Jakarta's key stock index rose 12% Tuesday to a 22-month high, while the nation's currency, the rupiah, has strengthened 5.6% since Friday, trading late Tuesday in Asia at 7,660 rupiah to the dollar. Traders said the market gains were fueled by \"panic buying\" driven by a perception that the political risks long associated with Indonesia were abating. \n\n  \"It's all about country risk in Indonesia, and with the election over this risk subsides,\" said the Singapore-based trading chief at a U.S. brokerage house. \"People are not overly concerned about who's in charge of the country - only that it's stable.\" \n\n  The IMF also placed its stamp of approval on the election by endorsing the $450 million loan late Monday in the U.S. While the fund never explicitly said it was withholding loans to Indonesia until after the election - as the World Bank did - it did delay a meeting that could have seen the funds disbursed earlier. Many observers saw this as the IMF pressing President B.J. Habibie's government for a free and fair vote. \n\n  Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director at the IMF, voiced optimism Monday in Washington over Indonesia's prospects for economic recovery. \"With inflation falling and the exchange rate stable, there is room to reduce interest rates further, thus improving prospects for recovery,\" Mr. Fischer said. The IMF official also said Indonesia's economic growth was likely to become positive by the end of the year, while inflation would fall to single digits. \n\n  But many financial analysts still are cautious about Indonesia. On the corporate side, they say that many Indonesian companies remain insolvent because of the combination of a weak rupiah and billions of dollars of debt. Although interest rates have been falling - one-month central-bank paper is now yielding 25%, down from 40% earlier in the year - it is still too expensive for most companies to raise financing. \n\n  The idea that Jakarta's main index, now at 687, is within striking distance of its precrisis high of 740, hit in July 1997, is a portent of an overcooked market, they warn. \"The prices can't hold from a fundamental point of view,\" said economist Neil Saker of SG Securities in Singapore. \n\n  Some observers warn that there could still be political tension ahead, despite the success of the actual vote. A fractious coalition government could emerge, making implementation of painful economic reforms all the more difficult. \n\n  But Indonesian businessmen still say the peaceful vote is significantly improving the investment climate. \n\n  Harun Hajadi, managing director of PT Ciputra, a major Indonesian property firm, said his attempts to restructure the company have been undercut by political risk over the past year. Foreign investors he courted balked because of perceived political and social risks; those who did consider projects demanded exorbitantly high returns. Sales of Ciputra's private homes fell 70% from precrisis levels, to 3,000 units last year, as soaring interest rates killed off consumer demand, Mr. Harun said. \n\n  But now he sees his business fortunes improving, mainly as a result of falling interest rates. \"The peacfulness of the election was a very significant event,\" he said. \n\n  Mr. Widjaja of Bank Internasional Indonesia, who is in the process of recapitalizing the bank, also said the calm will help him, too. Indonesian banks have been crushed by negative spreads - which means they pay borrowers higher rates than they earn from deposits. \"This situation should improve\" as a result of the vote, he said. \n\n  Perhaps most importantly, the peaceful votes could woo back Indonesia's ethnic-Chinese business class, whose shops and homes bore the brunt of much of last year's violence. Though the memories of last May's rioting remains fresh in their minds, and some continue to keep their families overseas for security reasons, many say they feel the security situation in the country is starting to improve. \n\n  \"During the past year I lost half of all I owned,\" said Richard Hakim, an ethnic Chinese businessman who owns the toiletries producer PT Kintamolek Masa. \"Things can only get better.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 08, 1999 19:48 ET (23:48 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909236Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:14:16.108445Z", "inner_id": 146, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5515, "annotations": [{"id": 5421, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "IHaKhAeKCW", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:21:05.936864Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:21:05.936890Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 409.11, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "60ed27b6-0148-42e7-8e22-a7876f14cd4a", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5515, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "U.S. DOE Touts $1B USDA Loan Plan To Oil Patch\n\n \n \n     By Campion Walsh \n \n\n  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Department of Energy is seeking to tap in a U.S. Department of Agriculture's $1 billion-a-year rural development loan program in order to help the country's distressed oil and gas producers. \n\n  Searching for ways to help small, independent domestic oil producers suffering from the 1998 plunge in crude oil prices, DOE officials discovered that Agriculture Department loan guarantees for rural business apply to oil and gas producers, said Peter Lagiovane of DOE's fossil energy division. \n\n  DOE began promoting the loan program at an April workshop with oil and gas producers in Oklahoma, Lagiovane said. It will discuss the program further at workshops planned in California in June or July, and in Texas in August, he said. \n\n  Since 1997, the Agriculture Department has had $1 billion in spending authority for the program, which aims to assist non-farm businesses in rural areas, encompassing regional populations of less than 50,000. \n\n  \"The oil industry hasn't been a big user of the loan program,\" said Dayton J. Watkins, administrator for Agriculture Department's rural business and cooperative division. \n\n  \"We're working at the staff level with the Department of Energy, trying to craft a relationship that's beneficial to (the oil and gas) industry,\" Watkins said. \n\n  Lagiovane said almost all of the smaller, independent oil and gas companies can apply for the loan guarantees because the program's rural requirements concern the location of a company's operations, and not its headquarters. \n\n \n    [New Funding Needed To Ensure Oil Sector Aid] \n \n\n  Since 1997, the Agriculture Department program has been fully subscribed, and oil companies would face stiff competition from other loan-hungry industries, Watkins said. \n\n  Given the difficult conditions in the petroleum sector over the past year, oil and gas companies may be able to show a particular need for assistance, but they'll also have to present reasonable credit risk, he said. \n\n  Earmarking funds for oil and gas producers would require new funding for the program from DOE or Congress, he said. \n\n  The program guarantees up to 80% of loans from private banks of up to $10 million per company. The average amount of loans has been about $1.5 million, and the default rate has been less than 3%. \n\n  Meanwhile, Sen. Pete Domenici's, R-N.M., plans to send a bill to the Senate floor later this month that would guarantee up to $500 million in emergency loans specifically for oil and gas producers. \n\n  On May 25, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved Domenici's bill, along with a similar bill sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to support the U.S. steel industry. \n\n  Domenici's bill, which was stripped from an emergency supplement spending bill passed last month, would allow oil and gas producers and oil-service companies to take loans of up to $10 million each with guarantees from the federal government. \n\n  Domenci's proposed emergency loan guarantee program would expire after five years, but loans could remain outstanding for a longer period. The program would cost the federal government $125 million in guarantees and $2.5 million in administrative costs, according to a draft of the bill. \n\n  The Agriculture Department's rural development program could cut down on administrative costs of Domenici's bill if it passes, according to Watkins. \n\n  The program has already helped to distribute assistance available to communities affected by military downsizing and the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said. \n\n  - By Campion Walsh; 202-862-9291; \ncampion.walsh@dowjones.com \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 09, 1999 15:29 ET (19:29 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909293Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:21:06.167511Z", "inner_id": 147, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5516, "annotations": [{"id": 5424, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "oIyLVy_OtR", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:23:05.597446Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:23:05.597466Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 118.497, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f0d00549-3341-4762-a9c0-1babba5c93d0", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5516, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(6/18):Column: Mexico&apos;s Telephone Monopoly Hang-Up\n\n \n \n\n  By Mary Anastasia O'Grady \n\n  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Friday's Wall Street Journal. Ms. O'Grady edits the Americas column). \n\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--\"...[T]here has not been significant pro-gress toward the policy goal of increasing the penetration rate to 20 [telephone] lines per 100 persons. As a result, Mexico is even further behind other countries than it was in 1990.\" \n\n  - From a draft copy of \"Regulatory Reform in Mexico's Telecommunications Industry,\" Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, February 1999. \n\n  The final release of this 57-page OECD report is due out shortly. Unless it is dramatically altered for political correctness, it promises to be an enormous embarrassment to a government that purports to defend the public interest. The stock of Telmex, Mexico's telecom `monopoly', is roaring, but Mexicans - or at least the ones who have been able to obtain telephones - are choking on their bills. \n\n  While the OECD acknowledges that the country's 1995 telecommunications law is a good one, it finds that \"the regulatory authority has inadequate powers to regulate, particularly in regard to regulation of the incumbent in markets where it has substantial market power.\" \n\n  Just why the regulator - known by the Spanish acronym Cofetel - has been unable to rein in Telmex and create a competitive market is a subject of much political debate. But the apolitical OECD draft report simply measures the results: Eight years after privatization, Mexican telephony consumers still suffer inordinately high cost structures and poor service, leaving them miserably behind their OECD counterparts. \n\n  When it comes to private monopolies, there is probably no better symbol in Mexico than giant Telmex. It is Mexico's second largest company and the largest on the Mexican Stock Exchange. When the company was privatized in 1990, the government granted it certain concessionary rights to attract investors. Although the market was officially opened to competition in 1997, Mexico's Competition Commission (CFC) said in March 1998 that Telmex continues to enjoy \"dominant status\" in five telecom markets. \n\n  One important problem the OECD report raises is the question of the regulator's political independence since its \"rights and obligations\" are delegated by the Ministry of Communications and Transportation. When pressed about the need to curtail Telmex's monopoly powers in October 1997, Minister Carlos Ruiz Sacristan said \"one has to be very careful not to negatively impact the stock market.\" In December 1997 a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter research paper commented favorably on Telmex, noting \"we continue to see regulators acting in favor of the company's interest, which is a positive.\" The OECD's report shows how this attitude, together with the \"inadequate statutory powers of Cofetel,\" has left Mexicans in the dark ages of telephony. \n\n  The report compares Mexico's telecommunications services to other OECD countries. One of the salient points is in the area of access: At the start of 1998, Mexico had less than 10 telephones per 100 inhabitants. Poland, the next worst performer among OECD countries, had 20. In Mexico no new access lines were added in 1996 and 1997. This is particularly scandalous given the fact that Cofetel argues, according to the OECD, that interconnection rates \"must be set above long-run incremental cost to encourage network expansion and universal service goals to be met.\" In other words, Telmex was given the right to charge high access rates to competitors because it was to use the extra income to get more phones to more people. \n\n  A second problem for consumers is high prices. The report shows Mexican \"tariff baskets\" for both residential and business service towering over the rest of the OECD. Inflation, the authors note, distorts this picture. But this seems scant justification: According to the publication Telecommunications, local phone service prices, which are still controlled by Telmex, increased 63% in 1997, not a year of raging inflation. Moreover, the report says that following the macroeconomic crisis that began in 1994, Telmex \"appreciated in relative value given the decline in the value of the Mexican peso on international markets.\" \n\n  In the February issue of the Inter-American Development Bank's magazine IDB America, Paul Constante compares telephone costs for a Mexican producer against those of a U.S. producer competing for business in London. For five calls of four minutes apiece the American pays $5.40 while the Mexican pays $25.20. The picture in local rates is even gloomier. \n\n  The report points out that Telmex, by concession, \"virtually owns all public networks and provides local and interconnection services.\" It is control over these interconnection services that in practice allows Telmex to control prices. Yet in telecom deregulation, this is the drill, nothing unique to Mexico. The real difficulties, say some analysts, comes from the fact that Cofetel, the ministry and Telmex set the terms for the concession in secrecy. There is no public hearing, no public record and no cost transparency; as far as the public knows, the regulator accepts whatever \"costs\" Telmex declares. \n\n  Not only are cost claims cryptic but there has been no public accountability for the failures in network expansion. Says Philip Peters, Vice President of the Lexington Institute in Virginia and a telecom expert, \"Cofetel bought the idea that high interconnection charges are needed to cover Telmex's investments in phone network expansion, but the money all went to Telmex general revenues. There was no segregated fund, much less an accounting of expenditures.\" \n\n  Some speculate that Telmex is protected because a drop in its share price would be bad for Mexican stability. This theory makes little sense. Policy makers have had ample time during the six-year presidency of Ernesto Zedillo to open up competition for the welfare of all citizens. And nothing would improve Mexico's stability more than productivity improvements derived from competition. \n\n  The CFC, to its credit, is pushing hard for competition. And Cofetel is now proposing to force Telmex to separate local and long distance pricing in order to end the practice of cross-subsidizing predatory pricing in competitive markets with revenues from local markets where there is almost no competition. Cofetel has also drafted rules that would force Telmex to share costs and data with rivals. \n\n  As if to demonstrate just how difficult that will be, Telmex sought and won an injunction last week against the CFC's \"dominant status\" ruling, which is the fulcrum of all Cofetel's reforms. Cofetel has promised to go back to court to argue that these reforms are in the national interest; if that can proven, the judge ruled, the decision can be reversed. \n\n  The legal wrangling is guaranteed to continue. But with a little political will the government can give Cofetel the power and independence it needs to help foster a competitive market. A good start would be requiring greater transparency in the regulatory process. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 18, 1999 02:49 ET (06:49 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909360Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:23:05.811109Z", "inner_id": 148, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5517, "annotations": [{"id": 5425, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "xIWxFsfChA", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:23:41.526758Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:23:41.526783Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 35.043, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "59eef3b8-da25-4cd5-80fc-4e1e385e9cc0", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5517, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Australia/Leading Index -3: Raising Rates In 1Q 2000\n\n \n \n\n  Strong gains in the share market, coupled with a rise in the real money supply and the amount of overtime worked also contributed to the strength of the April index. \n\n  Growth in the leading index is 2.8 percentage points above trend, and \"is now even more clearly signaling that growth through 1999 and into 2000 will be well above long-term trend,\" said Westpac's general manager of economics, Bill Evans. \n\n  \"This evidence casts further doubt on the generally held view that the Australian economy will experience a significant slowdown in the second half of 1999 and into 2000,\" he said. \n\n  The coincident index was also buoyed by strong March quarter national accounts. \"Nonetheless, the strength of the coincident index appears to have attenuated over the past few months, which was predicted by the leading index earlier. \n\n  Weak labor market statistics are the \"major soft spot\" for the coincident index,\" Evans said.

The main factors behind this are a continuing growth in household consumption and a gradual recovery in exporting as the effects of the Asian crisis subside,\" the NZIER said in a commentary. \n\n  \"Our export situation is still very vulnerable, with some sectors yet to show convincing signs of an improvement.

That would be unchanged from the first quarter rate, and within the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2% to 3% target band. \n\n  'That's still pretty modest inflation given that the economy is growing at plus-4%,' said Grant Fitzner, economist at HSBC Markets. \n\n  With inflation under control, and little prospect of a rate rise this year, Australian bonds ought to perform better relative to U.S. Treasurys, some analysts say. Though U.S. inflation also appears subdued, there's still some prospect the Federal Reserve will raise rates again in August. \n\n  'By the end of the month there should be a bit more of a focus on inflation and that should give the local bond market a bit more scope for outperformance,' says Su-Lin Ong, senior economist at RBC DS Global Markets. \n\n  She says the spread between 10-year Australian government bonds and the equivalent Treasurys issue could narrow to below 20 basis points, just above that level presently. But the extent of any narrowing would depend on where the spread stands before the July 28 inflation data release, given that the spread has come in quite dramatically this year. At the start of 1999, the spread was as high as 51 basis points. \n\n  Any rise in the spread back to 45 basis points or more would represent a good opportunity to take long positions in Australian bonds, says David Plank, fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank for Australia and New Zealand. \n\n  But some analysts say Australian bonds could struggle to extend their gains. \n\n  'We need to get good news to keep (bond) prices where they are,' said Paul Brennan, chief Australian economist at Salomon Smith Barney. \n\n  That suggests to some that Australian bonds will simply follow the direction of U.S. Treasurys, leaving the spread little changed. \n\n  And there's a greater danger that there will be some inflation surprise in the July 28 data which will trigger a selloff in Australian bonds. \n\n  'I think we only need to see a slightly higher-than-expected number to see the bond market sell off,' Brennan says. 'The market is pretty susceptible to bad news.' \n\n  Nevertheless, Brennan acknowledges that the yield spread could still hold at 20 basis points by year end, because of subdued inflation. \n\n  Craig James, chief economist at Colonial State Bank, said Australia's growing current account deficit is maintaining upward pressure on bond yields and limiting the scope for bond outperformance. Australia's first-quarter current account deficit stood at close to 6.0% of first-quarter gross domestic product. \n\n  'If we didn't have a current account deficit around 5% to 6% of GDP, clearly Australia should be trading below U.S. bonds,' giving a negative yield spread to Treasurys, said Craig James, chief economist with Colonial State Bank. \n\n  Australian bonds traded below Treasurys in May and June 1998 based because Australia's economic cycle was lagging the U.S.. But since then, the spread to Treasurys has been in positive territory, reflecting the premium demanded by offshore investors to hold Australian bonds given the growing current account deficit, James says. \n\n  'If you take all our factors into account, inflation, growth, productivity, wages growth, you would have to say Australia would have to be a magnet for offshore investors. \n\n  'Clearly Australia bonds are a magnet, but there is some degree of reticence about holding Australian bonds,' James said. \n\n- By Nicki Bourlioufas; (61 2) 8235 2959; nicki.bourlioufas@dowjones.com \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 20, 1999 23:04 ET (03:04 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909527Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:26:17.801006Z", "inner_id": 151, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5520, "annotations": [{"id": 5428, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "oOLn5ytrCw", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:26:52.118343Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:26:52.118369Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 33.628, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "40a6668b-c99b-4514-a743-a1e167521101", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5520, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Treasurys Drop On 2Q Rise In Labor Costs; Dlr Pressured\n\n \n \n\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Treasurys fell sharply Thursday morning, as investors sifted through several economic numbers and concluded that labor costs and other factors are likely to put upward pressure on rates. \n\n  The morning's reports included news of a stronger-than-expected 1.1% rise in employment costs in the second quarter, offset by a slowdown in gross domestic product growth to 2.3%.

Fischer is Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for trade.) \n\n  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--For the last nine months the Australian and New Zealand lamb industries have been involved in a difficult fight against calls from the American sheep-meat industry for tariffs and quotas to be placed on our exports to the U.S. The crude nature of the remedy proposals under consideration, combined with the lack of any reasonable case for punishing Australian lamb producers in this way, has turned the lamb issue into a huge test for our bilateral trade relationship, as well as for the United States' credentials as a world leader committed to free and fair trade. \n\n  On June 22, the United States Senate delivered a principled decision to resist the appeal of protectionism for the steel industry by setting aside a bill to impose quotas on steel imports. The American sheep-meat industry's recommendations, based on findings from the United States International Trade Commission, are now before U.S. President Bill Clinton for a final decision. The president must now show the same level of leadership on the lamb issue. \n\n  The governments of Australia and New Zealand have been pressing strongly against any decision to impose unjustified trade restraints, arguing this will do nothing to help the U.S. domestic industry, while it will penalize Australia's fairly traded, unsubsidized prime lamb exports and the American consumer. Putting trade barriers in place would be sadly ironic, even more so when done on the mere basis of a 'threat' of injury to U.S. lamb, which is all that the ITC has determined. Furthermore, the ITC found that Australia and New Zealand were not engaged in unfair trading. \n\n  Indeed, this latest wave of protectionism is not so much a response to pressures from overseas lamb producers. U.S. lamb producers are urging drastic tariff and quota measures in a knee-jerk reaction to difficulties in the domestic market. This is wrong-headed. The difficulties the producers face are not related to imports. They stem from an outmoded marketing approach that has sought to pitch prices for lamb at levels which are well out of line with prices for competing foodstuffs. \n\n  In Australia and New Zealand, where lamb meat is competitively priced, per capita consumption is 20 times that of the United States. An opportunity for U.S. lamb producers to achieve similar results is going begging. \n\n  Furthermore, efforts to limit imports can only backfire on U.S. lamb producers themselves. The U.S. industry must realize that keeping products at artificially high prices is no way to grow any market. Far from strengthening their industry, the protection domestic producers seek would only weaken the market for their product, hurting producers in the process. While consumers would be among the first to suffer, in time the lamb industry itself would face the prospect of further contraction as the domestic market became even more marginalized. \n\n  Recognizing the opportunities that exist both for ourselves and U.S. producers, Australian and New Zealand lamb producers generously offered to commit up to $1.5 million a year over four years toward joint promotion with U.S. industry. Unfortunately, this innovative and forward-looking offer was rejected by the U.S. industry out of hand. \n\n  Structural change is under way in the U.S. lamb industry. Like any industry, change will occur regardless of any Band-Aid protectionist fix. A more positive approach would be to undertake a realistic adjustment program with cooperation and fair competition from foreign producers. All stand to benefit. Should efforts to restrict foreign lamb imports into the U.S. succeed, however, everyone involved will suffer: those who wish to export lamb to the American market, American consumers and eventually even the American lamb industry itself. \n\n  Moreover, if President Clinton takes the wrong step on lamb, he will send the wrong signal to agricultural producers and governments in other countries. He will be saying that they can deal with the pressures of change by erecting barriers to trade. \n\n  With the U.S. set to host the vital WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle at the end of this year, it is not only Australia and New Zealand that will be sitting in judgment on how the U.S. administration responds to these unfair calls for import relief. The entire world will be watching. \n\n  In Auckland, New Zealand last month, trade ministers of the economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation met to plan for Seattle and to review the encouraging signs of economic recovery in East Asia. They recognized the remarkable commitment to free trade from economies that have suffered enormously during Asia's financial crisis - a commitment to keep their markets open when domestic pressures to close them have been intense. We and our neighbors have applauded the great contribution the United States has made toward recovery in Asia. \n\n  Yet history tells us that the pace of trade liberalization depends on the larger economies leading by example, and the success of Seattle will depend in large measure on the leadership of the United States. Such leadership can only be demonstrated if it is clear that the U.S. is committed to the principles of free trade and can resist protectionist pressure at home. \n\n  The recent outcome on the steel quota bill gives hope that President Clinton's endorsement of a new round of trade negotiations in his State of the Union address this year was meaningful. Australia hopes that this important step will be followed by the right decision in the lamb case. An industry threatened by change is best assisted by domestic adjustment support, not barriers to competition. All our industries hope for is the opportunity for us to work with the U.S. toward an outcome that will provide the basis for real, long-term prosperity for us all. \n\n  President Clinton now has an opportunity to deliver to the American people a win-win solution on this issue. A win for the forces of free trade, a win for American lamb producers - and above all, a win for American consumers. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 05, 1999 19:33 ET (23:33 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909704Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:32:12.851198Z", "inner_id": 154, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5523, "annotations": [{"id": 5433, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "IF4rUo-gRa", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:33:47.127651Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:33:47.127676Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 93.615, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "ea79c995-155c-4b91-8813-fbfa406748c4", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5523, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(7/27): Texaco Net Fell 20% In 2nd Quarter\n\n \n  By Alexei Barrionuevo \n  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  Higher crude-oil prices and lucrative refining margins on the West Coast gave a huge boost to Atlantic Richfield Co. in the second quarter and cushioned a drop in earnings for Texaco Inc. \n\n  Like their competitors, both companies benefited from crude-oil prices that shot up to nearly $20 a barrel by the quarter's end and from tight gasoline supply in California, which pushed prices -- and profit margins -- well above the national average during the spring. \n\n  For Texaco, though, higher prices couldn't overcome the effect of weak refining margins overseas. Texaco's net income slid 20% to $273 million, or 50 cents a diluted share, from $342 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. That was slightly above Wall Street's expectations of 49 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. \n\n  The quarter included $76 million in asset write-downs and $67 million in employee separation costs, but they were largely offset by inventory valuation adjustments, gains on tax issues and gains on asset sales. Before special items, earnings were $286 million, or 52 cents a share. \n\n  Revenue rose 3% to $8.27 billion from $8.04 billion in 1998. \n\n  Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said exploration and production earnings, before special items, rose 34% to $216 million, reflecting crude-oil prices that were up about 19% from a year earlier and up about 40% from the first quarter. \n\n  Texaco's U.S. refining business is part of a joint venture with Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Aramco. The company said improved West Coast refining and marketing margins, due mostly to refinery fires and other outages that caused supply shortages, were partly offset by problems at a Puget Sound refinery and scheduled maintenance at its Los Angeles refinery. Refining earnings overseas, however, fell 61% before unusual items. \n\n  Texaco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter I. Bijur said the company so far this year has cut per-barrel expenses by 9%, compared with a year earlier. \n\n  Arco, based in Los Angeles, more than doubled its net income to $313 million, or 95 cents a diluted share, from $154 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. \n\n  Excluding special items, profit was up 37% to $302 million, or 92 cents a diluted share, compared with $220 million, or 67 cents a share, last year. That beat analysts' estimate of 86 cents a share for the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. \n\n  Revenue climbed 21% to $3.22 billion from $2.65 billion in the year-earlier period. \n\n  Along with oil prices and California refining results, Arco Chairman and CEO Mike R. Bowlin credited the company's cost-cutting, saying that Arco expects to reach its goal of slashing $500 million in expenses by year end, one year ahead of schedule. \n\n  Arco said its refining and marketing earnings more than doubled to $206 million in the quarter, from $97 million in 1998. \n\n  Arco did it despite a scheduled shutdown at a Washington refinery that remained down most of June. Arco operates refineries in only five Western states, including California. \n\n  Oil and natural-gas production rose 10% in the quarter, helping push after-tax exploration and production profit to $174 million, up from $17 million in the yearearlier quarter, after a $75 million writedown of a gas field. \n\n  Shares of Texaco fell $1.50 to close at $60.875, while those of Arco dropped $1.8125 to close at $87.625, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 26, 1999 21:27 ET (01:27 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909760Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:33:47.351919Z", "inner_id": 155, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5524, "annotations": [{"id": 5434, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "I8duIcYnMv", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:34:18.251466Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:34:18.251500Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 30.234, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "fedfc8fe-cf2b-445f-8042-f063d73dcaf6", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5524, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "S African Ctrl Bk -2: Won&apos;t Be Pushed Into Lower Rates\n\n \n \n\n  JOHANNESBURG (Dow Jones)--Incoming South African Central Bank Governor Tito Mboweni Saturday reiterated his pledge to carry on the bank's tough monetarists approach, ruling out populist measures like pushing interest rates lower. \n\n  \"Artificial low interest rates - forget it,\" he told a media briefing. \n\n  \"It's a cost you will have to pay a couple of years down the line\" if softer credit is pursed, he said. \n\n  South African government interest rates, through the securities repurchase rate, has fallen 8.25 percentage points to 13.600% since last October.

More likely, they said, is that markets will stabilize and even rebound as housing and remodeling activity pick up - as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't move to raise interest rates too much. Fed policy makers increased interest rates one-quarter percentage point yesterday. \n\n  \"This industry ebbs and flows according to what the general market does,\" said Karl Lindberg, president of the Southern Forest Products Association, an industry trade group in Kenner, La. \n\n  As of Friday, the composite price per 1,000 board feet of framing lumber had fallen to $391 - a 20% drop from the record level of $490 reached in mid-July and the fifth consecutive weekly decrease, according to Random Lengths, an industry newsletter in Eugene, Ore. Prices also have been falling in other forestry products such as structural paneling, which dropped 26% to $333 per 1,000 board feet as of Friday from a high of $453 on July 16, according to officials at Random Lengths who add that these are the most precipitous drops in six years. \n\n  The price drops come as something of a surprise in the industry, which has watched prices increase for 10 months in a row on demand fueled primarily by a robust U.S. housing market. That trend led to unexpectedly strong earnings reports by many of the timber companies, such as Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Portland, Ore., and Plum Creek Timber Co., Seattle, in the second quarter. \n\n  Although the housing market remains strong, industry executives say the supply of wood products recently exceeded demand in part because of the unusually hot summer weather in many parts of the country. That led to construction delays that backed up timber products in the distribution pipeline, they say. \n\n  Timber production, meanwhile, has ramped up rapidly. The amount of timber products made on the West Coast jumped 11% through June from the same period last year, while they rose 7% in the South and 5.6% in the Mountain West over the same time, according to estimates by industry trade groups. \n\n  \"The numbers have been spectacular in terms of production, exceeding everyone's expectation,\" said Mike O'Halloran, president of the Western Wood Products Association, a trade group based in Portland. \n\n  Timber manufacturers aren't expressing too much concern over the price drops just yet. While few will predict when prices might bottom out, most people in the industry view the situation as a temporary setback to a recovery they say could last for two or more years. During the second quarter, the industry pulled out of a two-year slump that was prompted by an oversupply of wood products and slackened demand from Asian markets. \n\n  \"You have to remember where prices were when they started coming off,\" said Keith Matheney, vice president of core businesses at Louisiana-Pacific. \"This is in my view a normal correction.\" \n\n  Indeed, manufacturers report continued strong demand in the U.S. for lumber and other wood products. \n\n  \"The other thing helping us is that Europe is getting better and is likely to continue improving over the next five years,\" said Rick Holley, chief executive of Plum Creek. \"I think the overall industry is going to have an excellent year.\" \n\n  Analysts pointed out, though, that the timber industry remains a highly volatile sector whose fortunes can change overnight. Aside from being prone to the vagaries of economic cycles, analysts said the industry suffers from being fragmented into thousands of producers who frequently manufacture excess quantities. \"We are sort of guessing where we go from here,\" said Burrle Elmore, editor of Random Lengths. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 25, 1999 00:41 ET (04:41 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909869Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:46:34.860153Z", "inner_id": 157, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5526, "annotations": [{"id": 5443, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "a0sVh2VVR7", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:47:40.010396Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:47:40.010422Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 64.401, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "0c5e07d1-adfe-4536-951c-cca91b736464", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5526, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Venezuelan Official: Oil-Price Rise May Obviate New Debt\n\n \n\n  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Venezuelan Planning Minister Jorge Giordani suggested Tuesday that the country may not issue foreign debt, or simply reduce the amount it originally sought in overseas capital markets this year. \n\n  The sustained rise in oil prices could mean windfall revenues of up to $1.2 billion, Giordani said in answer to questions on whether Venezuela still plans to raise $1.4 billion to $2 billion abroad. \n\n  He didn't elaborate. \n\n  The executive branch is looking to finance a 1999 budget deficit equivalent to 9% of gross domestic product, or about $9 billion. \n\n  Giordani said the economy is still on course to meet the official 1999 inflation target of 20% to 24%, which is down from the near 30% rise in prices last year. \n\n  Venezuela's consumer price index rose 1.6% in July, up from the 1.5% rise posted in June but down from the 2.1% increase in July of last year. \n\n  Inflation for the first seven months of the year amounted to 11.9%, down markedly from 18.2% the year before, the Central Bank of Venezuela announced Monday. \n\n  Giordani said the executive branch believes the economy will recuperate \"soon,\" and added that the recovery in demand wouldn't fuel inflation.

But David J. Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, estimates the retail price of a pack of cigarettes next year will average about $2.65, nearly $1 more than in 1997. \n\n  The price increase is the second largest in history, after a 45-cent-a-pack boost last November, when tobacco companies agreed to pay $206 billion to 46 states that had sued seeking to recover money spent caring for people with smoking-related diseases. \n\n  Cigarette makers confirmed the 18-cent-a-pack increase, but declined to comment further. Analysts said the latest jump will cover an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes, which goes up by 10 cents a pack starting Jan. 1. Another four cents of the per-pack increase is needed to pay tobacco companies' obligations under various legal settlements, they said. The remaining four cents a pack amounts to a fairly standard annual price rise for the industry. \n\n  \"If they didn't take this price increase, profits would have been under pressure,\" Mr. Adelman said. \n\n  Besides Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., maker of Camels, British American Tobacco PLC's Brown & Williamson unit and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco Co. subsidiary also boosted their prices, a move that is likely to widen profit margins through the end of the year, analysts said. \n\n  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Philip Morris shares were up 18.75 cents to $37.75; R.J. Reynolds shares fell 12.5 cents to $28, and Loews shares fell 87.5 cents to $78.625. American depositary shares of British American Tobacco were unchanged at $17.5625 on the American Stock Exchange. \n\n  The higher prices could further damp demand for cigarettes. But low unemployment and the buoyant economy, which have put more disposable income in the hands of smokers, may blunt any decline, said Martin Feldman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. \n\n  The price increase came earlier than expected by wholesalers, preventing them from stocking up on cigarettes at the old, lower prices. \"It was a big surprise when we got the telegram last Friday afternoon,\" said Del Peterson, president of Moreland Wholesale Inc., in Cheyenne, Wyo. Mr. Peterson complained that wholesalers will get pinched, since they have to start paying the new prices before they can raise the prices they charge retailers. \n\n  The timing of the price rise, well ahead of the tax increase and settlement obligations that will kick in next year, also gives tobacco companies plenty of flexibility to offer discounts to customers, Mr. Feldman said. \"Consumers will only gradually feel the price increase,\" he predicted. \n\n  After last year's sharp price rise, cigarette makers used aggressive discounts and promotions to keep smokers from abandoning premium brands in favor of lower-cost alternatives. The strategy worked, Mr. Feldman said, preventing serious erosion of the big-name brands' market share. \n\n  Even so, some cigarette sellers caution that sooner or later, the price increases will turn off smokers. \"They're going to drive everybody to lower priced brands and roll-your-own,\" said Michael P. Washo, owner of Carolina Tobacco Emporium in Enfield, Conn. He said he has seen a sharp increase in sales of loose tobacco and rolling paper to customers who now prefer to make their own cigarettes. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 30, 1999 20:19 ET (00:19 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.909978Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:49:20.913102Z", "inner_id": 159, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5528, "annotations": [{"id": 5445, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "fqVvany28w", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T08:50:09.616664Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:50:09.616679Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 48.008, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "ff2f5c65-cde1-48b0-aaae-c6d65304cb65", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5528, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Interview/McDonough-3: &quot;Attentive&quot; To Inflation Pressures\n\n \n \n\n  Turning to inflation, McDonough, who arrived in South Africa Friday morning, said he hadn't had a chance to digest Friday's batch of U.S. labor data - which analysts said was clearly inflationary. \n\n  Nevertheless, the Fed deputy chairman said the U.S. central bank had to be \"attentive\" to a situation where labor costs rise beyond productivity gains. \n\n  Late this week, the U.S. economy was presented with clear evidence of this, through a series of government data. \n\n   McDonough refused to be drawn on the monetary policy implications of the most recent figures, but said \"by far, the best time to do anything about inflation is early.\" \n\n  On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said employers added 310,000 more workers to their payrolls in July - well above expectations of a rise of 206,000.

However, Mr. Chandler still expects the dollar to trade lower in the early part of this week, from 108.80 yen to 110.50 yen. He expects the euro to trade in a range of $1.0500 to $1.0700 in the early part of the week. \n\n  The dollar has tended recently to follow movements in U.S. stocks and bonds, which have been pressured by expectations of tighter monetary policy. Friday, the U.S. currency shared a relief rally with stocks and bonds after the August employment report showed less overheating in the economy than expected. \n\n  In late-afternoon trading Friday, the dollar was at 109.93 yen, up from 109.13 yen late Thursday. The euro was trading at $1.0613, down from $1.0690. Sterling was at $1.0620, down from $1.0675. \n\n  The New York exchange markets were closed yesterday to observe Labor Day. \n\n  With the market living from indicator to indicator and comment to comment, a firm commitment to bid the dollar higher or lower against either currency will be stymied by the anxiety ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech tomorrow in Michigan, Japan's long-awaited gross-domestic-product numbers Thursday and U.S. producer prices Friday. \n\n  \"A lot will depend on the other side of the equation, with rising optimism about the euro zone and Japan, \" said Kathy Jones, currency analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. \n\n  The euro, she said, should be the beneficiary of the uncertainty surrounding both U.S. and Japanese fundamentals. \n\n  Since the dollar began its decline in mid-July, the euro has moved about 5% higher since bottoming out July 13 at $1.0108. The yen, however, has moved more than 10% higher since its July 8 low of 122.75 yen. Ms. Jones said the euro has more room to move higher. \n\n  Investors wanting to get out of dollar holdings are reluctant to buy yen due to the currency's potential for a quick decline if Japan intervenes to halt its appreciation or next week's GDP numbers fail to validate Japan's recovery story. \n\n  The yen, which has been a favorite for investors and hedgers, is considered overbought, Ms. Jones said. \n\n  Last Wednesday, it posted a seven-and-a-half-month high of 108.73 yen against the dollar. But at these higher levels, she said, the currency is vulnerable and could decline rapidly if the Bank of Japan opts to limit the currency rise or Friday's growth numbers disappoint investors. Mr. Chandler said positioning in preparation for central-bank intervention and Japan's growth numbers should be the driving force behind the dollar's trade this week. \n\n  Meanwhile, financial problems brewing in emerging markets-debt restructuring in Ecuador, Chile's float of its currency and renewed currency woes in Thailandcould eventually lead spooked international investors back into the dollar. \n\n  A lingering political wrangle over the Taiwan Strait has already weighed considerably on the yen against the dollar in several Asian sessions this week. \n\n  Any development interpreted as bringing Beijing and Taipei closer to armed conflict would buoy the dollar. The New Taiwan dollar was at NT$31.750 late Friday, unchanged from Thursday. \n\n  The U.S. dollar was at 1,191 won, up a bit from 1,190 won. \n\n  Steven Xu, a treasury economist at the Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, said although developments in corporate sector will continue to drive volatile swings in the dollar-won exchange rate this week, the U.S. currency should remain within a broad 1,180 won to 1,200 won band. \n\n  But South Korean Friday pledged to defend five Yellow Sea islands after North Korea threatened to use military force to gain control of contested waters around them. If shooting breaks out, the dollar would rise on \"flight to safety\" buying. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 06, 1999 20:01 ET (00:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910087Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T08:52:06.793301Z", "inner_id": 161, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5530, "annotations": [{"id": 5447, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "SQrM-ikrn7", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T09:03:31.962942Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T09:03:31.962955Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 684.48, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "36608a6a-6ae6-49ac-ae36-0b4b7bb3a535", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5530, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Thai Fin Min: Oil Prices Higher On Global Mkt, Not Baht\n\n \n \n\n  BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Thursday the government shouldn't take immediate action to ease domestic oil prices, because the increases in oil prices are due mostly to global market factors, rather than local or currency factors. \n\n  Tarrin told reporters after a speech to foreign businessmen and the Thai Customs Department that the government should wait for the results of an upcoming meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries before deciding to take action. \n\n  Industry Minister Suwat Liptapanlop said earlier Thursday that domestic oil prices were at their highest levels this year, and the government was looking at what it could do to stem further increases. \n\n  The retail price of unleaded premium gasoline is up 0.30 baht (THB) on last week's levels to THB13.29. \n\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar had risen to around THB39.70 midday Thursday, from less than THB39 last week. \n\n  Tarrin said high oil prices shouldn't affect growth prospects this year.

The tactic was designed to put maximum pressure on the Republicans in Congress to move forward with passing the spending bills needed to fund the entire federal in fiscal year 2000. \n\n  However, after remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and poor inflation outlook figures frightened investors, the White House apparently figured that adding another element of instability to the financial markets was unwise at best. \n\n  What spooked investors was the combination of Greenspan's cautioning banks they need to set aside reserves for any downdraft in stock prices and the news the producer price index jumped 1.1% in September from the month earlier. \n\n \n\n  Treasury Secretary Summers Gives Marching Orders \n\n \n\n  With early indications showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average would open sharply lower, the White House mobilized quickly Friday morning to do what little it could to prevent a retreat from becoming a stampede. \n\n  Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers gave White House officials explicit instructions on what they could say and what the couldn't say to restore a semblance of confidence. \n\n  \"I think it is important to remember the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. While we monitor all economic indicators, we base government policy and economic policy on overall long-term economic trends,\" Lockhart said parroting Summers' message. \n\n  Asked if he could comment directly on the prospect for inflation in the economy, Lockhart said he couldn't because remarks along these lines hadn't been cleared by the Treasury secretary. \n\n  National Economic Council Chairman Gene Sperling was given greater latitude and used it during a brief appearance with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on a separate matter. \n\n  Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Sperling said the administration expects continued growth coupled with low inflation. \n\n  In a surprise move, Sperling also gave an early indication of what the third quarter gross domestic product will look like to support his forecast. \n\n  \"The third quarter GDP numbers should be quite solid,\" Sperling said. He didn't elaborate on this prediction, but administration officials rarely if ever offer previews of economic figures. \n\n \n\n  Trying To Find A Sanction To Slap On Pakistan \n\n \n\n  William Milam, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, met Pakistani Army Chief of Staff Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf for two hours Friday but found the general unwilling to make any commitment to return Pakistan to civilian rule soon. \n\n  Rebuffed, the White House began a search for an economic sanction to slap on Pakistan but was stymied by the fact that it has already slapped a number of sanctions on Islamabad because of its nuclear weapons tests. \n\n  \"The lawyers are looking at this now....In practical terms, there's already a wide range of sanctions applied against Pakistan,\" Lockhart said. \n\n  Likewise, the U.S. will have little success in trying to put pressure on Pakistan by seeking to block the International Monetary Fund from giving Islamabad loans. The IMF has already suspended its loan program to Pakistan anyway. \n\n  \"At this point, it's a bit of a moot point,\" Lockhart conceded. \n\n  \"If they get to the point where they come into compliance, we'll take a look at whether the behavior of the military government there warrants the United States' looking at blocking further loans,\" Lockhart said. \n\n  -By Alex Keto; 202 862 9256; Dow Jones Newswires, alex.keto@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 15, 1999 16:23 ET (20:23 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910406Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:29:51.965072Z", "inner_id": 167, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5536, "annotations": [{"id": 5474, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "uVmg-BEqr5", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T10:30:51.007759Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:30:51.007791Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 58.311, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e945d81f-ef2b-4f68-b0d8-bf27a8b794f2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5536, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "REPEAT:Iraq Al-Anbari Sees $22 As &quot;Reasonable Oil Price&quot;\n\n \n \n\n  BAGHDAD (AP)--The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should work towards \"a reasonable price\" for crude oil in the range of $22 a barrel, Iraq's candidate for OPEC secretary general said Monday. \n\n  Abdulamir al-Anbari, in a telephone interview from Paris, also dismissed reports that Iraq will drop his nomination in return for political concessions from Saudi Arabia. \n\n  \"$22 is a reasonable price...If prices shoot to $28 or $30 that will be too high,\" al-Anbari said. \n\n  The 1999 average of OPEC's basket price is currently $15.49 a barrel. \n\n  The value of the reference basket of seven crude oils used by the OPEC as a gauge of world oil price levels averaged $22.85 a barrel Friday. \n\n  Al-Anbari's remarks contradict those by Iraqi parliamentary speaker Saadoun Hammadi Sunday in which he called on OPEC to cut production further to raise oil prices to more than $33 a barrel. \n\n  They also run contrary to those by President Saddam Hussein who was reported as telling his cabinet last month that the price was still too low and accused the U.S. of manipulating the market. \n\n  OPEC ministers, who met in Vienna last month, agreed to keep their oil cutbacks in place through the end of March 2000. But they were deadlocked on the issue of selecting a new secretary general with Rilwanu Lukman remaining in place until next March. \n\n  Al-Anbari now competes with candidates from OPEC's two biggest members - Saudi Arabia's Suleiman Jasir al-Herbish and Iran's Hossein Kazempour Ardebili. \n\n  \"What political concessions my government can expect from Saudi Arabia? Nothing. Regarding sanctions, that is in the hands of America,\" al-Anbari said. \n\n  Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid, in a news conference last week, described al-Anbari as \"the most qualified\" among OPEC's candidates. \"The Iraqi candidate,\" he said, \"is the one who will guarantee OPEC's independence...and safeguard it against external influences.\" \n\n  Iraq has repeatedly accused Saudi Arabia of producing more crude than what it should in a bid to flood markets and lower prices to serve U.S. strategic interests in the region. \n\n  Rashid said Iraq had no intention of dropping al-Anbari's nomination. \n\n  Al-Anbari, however, said he was certain the Saudis and others will block his nomination but added many in OPEC opted for \"the most efficient, the most qualified\" to take the job. \n\n  And since OPEC rules require a unanimous decision in appointing a secretary general, al-Anbari suggested the formation of a high-level committee to decide who is better-placed to win the top job among the three candidates. \n\n  \"Many (OPEC) ministers have agreed to this proposal,\" he said. \n\n  Iraq nominated al-Anbari just before the OPEC talks last month, a move many saw as a maneuver to block a Saudi or Iranian winning the job following the withdrawal of Algeria's Oil Minister Yousef Yousefi. \n\n  Oil Ministry officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had nothing against the qualifications of the Saudi candidate. \"He's a good man but our candidate is also of a high caliber,\" said one. \n\n  Anbari holds law degrees from Baghdad University and Harvard University and has held many posts in the Iraqi oil industry in the late 1960s through the 1970s. He also served in the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries and was director of the OPEC legal department for more than 25 years ago. \n\n  He has been Iraq's ambassador to Britain and the U.S. and was Baghdad's U.N. envoy during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

The firm attributed the monthly rise to ongoing efforts to shut down unprofitable units and reduce staff. \n\n  At the same time, an analysis of sales at 69 retailers by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi places September same-store sales 6.7% above year-ago levels, equaling August's gain. \n\n  This was consistent with a similar survey run by Salomon Smith Barney, whose chain store index was up 6.3% in September from a year ago, also matching August's gain. \n\n  Yet a third report Thursday showed U.S. consumer credit expanded sharply in August, making for another sign of Americans' willingness to continue spending. \n\n  The Federal Reserve said Thursday that outstanding consumer credit advanced at a 9.6% annual rate, or by $10.8 billion, in August - the fastest increase in dollar terms since January, which saw a $15.3 billion increase, the Fed said. \n\n  The number underscores the strength in domestic consumption, which is what worries Federal Reserve officials. The Federal Open Market Committee announced Tuesday it was leaning toward tighter monetary policy ahead, noting that \"growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply.\" \n\n  This consumption news will become an irritant factor for the voting members of the FOMC, as this survey suggests consumers have not slowed down their spending spree despite recent monetary policy tightening. \n\n  Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC are calling for an increase of 220,000 in payrolls in September, and for the unemployment rate to remain steady at 4.2%. \n\n  Yet, despite all of the potentially negative news late, the market didn't react, preferring to mark time ahead of the payroll number. This is because the market has already adequately priced in the potential rate move. \n\n  For example, Treasury market observers noted that the yield curve has flattened since the Federal Reserve adopted a \"tightening bias\" Tuesday, with the yields of longer-dated maturities moving closer together with the shorter-dated Treasurys. \n\n  But even though the market has rebounded off of its lows Thursday, analysts say that investors remain extremely cautious and defensive. \n\n  \"The market is directionless and it's searching for a theme,\" said David Greenlaw, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. Inc. in New York. \n\n  \"But it's unlikely it find direction in Friday's number,\" he added, \"as there's a series of data due out between now and Nov. 16 that could potentially steer the Fed one way or another.\" \n\n-By Umberto Torresan; Dow Jones Newswires; \n 201-938-2206; umberto.torresan@dowjones.com \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 07, 1999 16:27 ET (20:27 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910520Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910529Z", "inner_id": 169, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5538, "annotations": [{"id": 5475, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "5r-vXOWh_a", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T10:31:49.841127Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:31:49.841145Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 57.847, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "c61df191-aad1-497e-acb8-e8703cf68c1e", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5538, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Kazakstan Forced To Sell Tengiz Oil Stake - Official\n\n \n\n  ALMATY, Kazakstan (Dow Jones)--The government of Kazakstan is forced to sell a part of its stake in international oil operating consortium, Tengizchevroil, because of its cash crisis, a top official said Monday. \n\n  \"The general economic situation is forcing\" the government to sell a part of its holding in the consortium, which operates the country's biggest oil field, Tengiz, said Kananbek Zhumin, director at state oil company Kazakoil. \n\n  Like several top Kazak officials, Zhumin said he is against the plan to reduce the government's stake in the company, possibly the state's most valuable asset. The plan, initially announced by the then-Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, has prompted unusually vocal opposition in Kazakstan's government circles. \n\n  Analysts say the government needs a massive privatization deal before the end of this year, to plug a budget gap, largely caused by low world oil prices early this year, as well as the financial crisis in neighboring Russia last year. \n\n  Zhumin said Monday the government has approached 20 major oil companies with an offer that is thought to involve 10% of the operating company. \n\n  \"Officially, I can say there have been such talks, but as far as I know, there has so far been no final decision,\" Zhumin said. \n\n  Kazakstan is in the middle of a government crisis after Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev resigned Friday, officially to return to Kazakhoil as the company's president. The country, where the powerful president appoints the ministers, is now run by an acting government. \n\n  The Kazakoil official Monday declined to name the government's asking price. \n\n  \"It is in the billions,\" Zhumin said. \n\n  Press reports have put the asking price between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion. Last week, Russia's biggest oil company, OAO Lukoil, said it is interested in acquiring the stake but called the Kazak government's asking price \"excessive.\" \n\n  The other members of the consortium - Chevron (CHV) and Mobil (MOB) - are also thought to be considering the Kazak government's preliminary offer. \n\n  France's Total Fina S.A. (TOT), which is a stake holder in another Kazakstan-based consortium, the Offshore Kazakstan International Operating Company (OKIOC), has also announced its interest in the stake. \n\n  Tengizchevroil produces 220,000 barrels oil crude oil a day, with an output of 260,000 b/d targeted by the middle of next year, according to the consortium. \n\n  Large-scale privatization sales have become the government's recurrent resolution to its wide budget deficits. \n\n  Late last year Kazakstan helped balance its budget by selling its stake in OKIOC to the U.S.'s Phillips Petroleum and Japan's Inpex. \n\n  This year, Kazakstan's cash needs will also depend on the government's ability to reach a new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \n\n  After talks at last week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, the loan negotiations are expected to resume later this month. \n\n  Kazakstan targets an oil output of 28.5 million metric tons this year, compared with 26.0 million tons in 1998, a senior official from the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Trade said, also speaking at the Monday press conference. \n\n  -By Paivi Munter; munter@ap.org \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 04, 1999 09:21 ET (13:21 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910583Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:31:50.061993Z", "inner_id": 170, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5539, "annotations": [{"id": 5476, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "Am4_Pe1caW", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T10:33:29.891381Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:33:29.891406Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 99.04, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e0de88b9-d0f2-409a-8f04-798e0bda33b9", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5539, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Verbatim Text Of The FOMC Decision On Interest Rates\n\n \n \n\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The following is the verbatim text of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announcement Tuesday afternoon. \n\n  The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%.

But the so-called core rate of prices, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, was up by 0.3%, a lot more than the 0.1% economists had projected. \n\n  That number was affected largely by big one-month increases for autos (1.1%) and prescription drugs (1.2%). Although observers in both industries said the jumps likely were exaggerated by statistical factors, some economists couldn't help but suspect that real-world price pressures also are at work. That could draw the attention of Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet Tuesday to decide whether the hot U.S. economy needs an interest-rate increase to cool off. \n\n  Of the two widely noted factors in yesterday's numbers, the drug-price increase attracted more attention, because of recent drug-industry merger activity as well as the political heat being generated by the issue. \n\n  On Tuesday, the House Democratic leadership and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton held a Capitol Hill rally to tout President Clinton's proposed prescriptiondrug benefit for Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and the disabled. In addition, some consumer advocates worry about the possible impact of growing concentration in the industry. \n\n  Several analysts noted that drug companies often implement price increases toward the end of the year, in hopes of affecting orders placed for the new calendar year. In addition, the analysts noted that some new drugs with fewer side effects are being priced at significant premiums. \n\n  The analysts added that some genericdrug makers have been more aggressive about raising prices in recent years, a trend that could have contributed to the October drug-price jump. The drug categories that saw the largest increases include some with a significant generic-drug presence, including hormones (5.3%), antiarthritics (4.5%), analgesics (2.6%), and dermatologicals (2.5%), said William Snyders, a Labor Department economist. \n\n  Still, several industry analysts viewed the October drug-price jump as an anomaly. In general, price increases in recent months \"are nothing different than what we've seen the last four-five years,\" said Hemant Shah, pharmaceuticals analyst for HKS & Co. \n\n  The increase in auto prices appeared to be affected in part by record-breaking demand for cars this year, analysts said. That put more year-2000 models into the sales mix as soon as they were available, said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, McLean, Va. \n\n  From October 1998 to October 1999, prices for new cars are up only 0.3% on a nonseasonally adjusted basis, he said. The producer-price report reflects \"an anomaly in the inventory of new cars,\" Mr. Taylor said. \n\n  A record total of 16.8 million units (cars and light trucks) are likely to be sold in the U.S. in 1999, Mr. Taylor said. The old record of 16.04 million units was set in 1986. \n\n  David Littman, chief economist at Comerica Inc. in Detroit, also pointed to the weakening dollar as a key factor, as it makes foreign cars more expensive in the U.S. \"Competition remains a restraining factor, but nothing is more powerful than a reversal of the strengthening dollar,\" he said. \n\n  But major foreign auto makers insist the fierce pricing battles in the marketplace mean they have little room to pass the effect of a weaker dollar on to consumers. \n\n  The producer-price report comes in time to influence Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Fed officials have said the producerprice numbers don't matter much in their decision-making about interest rates because they are so much narrower than the consumer-price index, which doesn't come out again until Wednesday. Some economists said the PPI number will carry more weight this time. \n\n  \"The greater-than-expected rise in the core PPI has swayed our expectations for a Nov. 16th rate hike,\" said analysts at Warburg Dillon Read, Stamford, Conn. \"We now put a 60-40 probability\" on a one-quarter point rate increase. \n\n  Overall, the October producer-price numbers were a big improvement over September, when the core rate jumped 0.8%. Excluding the increase for autos and light trucks, in fact, the Labor Department said that the core rate would have been in line with expectations. Still, policy makers aren't likely to dismiss the auto- and drug-price increases as mere statistical noise, Warburg analysts said. \"We don't believe the Fed is going to play this game,\"said Joe Carson, a Warburg economist. \n\n  Analysts also noted that price pressures seem to be building further back in the producer pipeline. For example, prices for intermediate-stage goods other than food and energy were up 0.4%, said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C. Also, of the more than 60 core intermediate-stage materials, prices of more than two-thirds increased, he said. \"I see a continuation of the gradual but consistent upturn in inflationary pressures,\" Mr. Orr said. \n\n  Other analysts made much less of the latest report. Over the past 12 months, in fact, producer-price growth remained relatively tame at 2.7%. \"This is marginally negative news that shouldn't fundamentally alter inflation expectations,\" said Jay Feldman, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. \n\n  As for any rise in pipeline pressures, he said, that probably will take a backseat to recent statistics showing decelerating wages and accelerating productivity. \n\n  Adding to the picture of a bustling economy was a new weekly report on unemployment claims. It showed that for the week ended Nov. 6, initial claims were down 6,000 to 285,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. \n\n  --- \n\n  Gregory L.

O'Driscoll Jr., Kim R. Holmes And Melanie Kirkpatrick \n\n  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Tuesday's Wall Street Journal. Mr. O'Driscoll and Mr. Holmes, of the Heritage Foundation, and Ms. Kirkpatrick, of the Journal's editorial page, are co-editors of the \"2000 Index of Economic Freedom.\" \n\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--At the dawn of a new century and a new millennium, it's good news to learn that economic freedom is on the rise world-wide. \n\n  That's the principal finding of this year's edition of the Index of Economic Freedom, jointly published by the Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal. Of the 161 countries rated, many more (57) expanded economic freedom during the past year than curtailed it (34). \n\n  If this trend continues, the world-wide growth in economic freedom will be measured by the increase in prosperity of more and more of the world's people. In future centuries, people may come to marvel over the concept of \"poverty\" and how some governments relegated their citizens to that awful state when they might instead have lifted them into prosperity. \n\n  But for now, poverty is still with us. Despite the gains recorded in this year's Index of Economic Freedom, the bad news is that a majority of the world's economies remain unfree. Overall, the economies of 73 countries are rated this year as \"free\" or \"mostly free,\" while 88 earned ratings of \"mostly unfree\" or \"repressed.\" The freest economies are concentrated in North America and Europe, while a majority of the repressed economies are in Asia and Africa. Latin America showed the most improvement. \n\n  The Index of Economic Freedom is now in its sixth edition. Every year we rank the world's economies according to 50 economic variables in 10 broad categories: banking, capital flows and foreign investment, monetary policy, fiscal burden of government, trade policy, wages and prices, government intervention in the economy, property rights, regulation, and black markets. Each year the data point to the same important conclusion: Countries with the most economic freedom also have higher rates of long-term economic growth; their people are better off, at all income levels. \n\n  Here, region by region, are the principal findings of the 2000 Index of Economic Freedom: \n\n  North America and Europe \n\n  This remains the most economically free region in the world, containing five of the 10 freest countries. Nineteen countries achieved better scores than last year, while only five saw their scores worsen. \n\n  The dominant trend this year is the improvement in monetary-policy scores: 10 of the 43 countries saw their ratings go up. In fact, this region can generally be characterized by its low inflation: half of the countries in Europe and North America have inflation rates below 6%. \n\n  The reasons for overall progress in economic freedom are threefold: First, some formerly communist countries have enacted policies that have yielded remarkable achievements since they gained their independence. Estonia (No. 22), Hungary (41), and Armenia (84) illustrate the economic success that can come from free-market policies: Armenia's real gross domestic product has averaged 5.7% growth since 1994, while Estonia has grown by 4.2% and Hungary by 3.3%. \n\n  Second, present-day Europe bears the marks of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set strict monetary and fiscal disciplinary requirements for would-be member states of the European Monetary Union. This commitment to the economic union presented a policy challenge to signatories. Some nations have struggled to meet the Maastricht requirements or have barely tried to adhere to them, while others, such as Luxembourg (No. 4), have seized the opportunity to enact structural reforms. All 11 countries in the EMU rate the highest possible monetary policy score of 1. Nonetheless, many of these countries continue to struggle with a high fiscal burden of government. \n\n  The third thread evident in Europe and North America this year is the success of the Anglo-American pattern of capitalism in promoting economic freedom. While mainland Europe tends, in broad terms, to adhere to market socialism, the United Kingdom (No. 8), Ireland (7) and other countries with British roots such as the U.S. (4) and Canada (11) follow a more capitalist approach to economic policy. While not the only valid route, Anglo-American capitalism by and large has led to a high level of economic freedom, as this year's index indicates. \n\n  Latin America and the Caribbean \n\n  For the second year in a row, this region made the greatest overall progress toward economic freedom. Of the 26 countries graded, 13 improved and only three worsened. The dominant story in this region is the number of countries that are controlling inflation; one-third received better monetary policy scores. \n\n  Chile and El Salvador (tied at No. 11) are the freest economies in the region, followed by Argentina (17), the Bahamas (22), Trinidad and Tobago (31) and Panama (33). Argentina's improved score reflects the effects of deregulation and remarkably lower inflation rates over the past few years. Brazil's score (No. 110) worsened due to the financial crisis and the government's subsequent policies, which resulted in higher taxes and increased government expenditures. The fate of the Brazilian government's economic reform program, enacted in response to the crisis, is in question, leaving the future of economic freedom in Latin America's largest country in doubt. \n\n  In Central and South America, economic freedom rose in Chile, El Salvador, Argentina, Barbados (No. 37), Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica (37), Uruguay (37), Bolivia (44), Belize (53), Costa Rica (58), the Dominican Republic (61), Honduras (99) and Cuba (157). Guatemala (46), Ecuador (84) and Brazil regressed. The rest remained the same. \n\n  North Africa and the Middle East \n\n  Economic freedom improved in this region as well. Of the 18 countries graded, seven improved their scores and two worsened. The improvements were largely a result of lower inflation rates and less government intervention in the economy. Bahrain (No. 4) is the economically freest country in the region. Its high score is chiefly the result of a lack of taxation on personal income and corporate profits. Bahrain also has one of the world's lowest levels of inflation, as well as a strong and efficient court system that upholds the rule of law. \n\n  The United Arab Emirates (No. 19) has the second freest economy, followed by Kuwait (37), Israel (49), Morocco (49), Oman (53), and Jordan (61). Other mostly unfree countries are Tunisia (74), Qatar (81), Lebanon (90), Algeria (108) and Egypt (110). Yemen (134), Syria (139), Iran (134), Iraq (160), and Libya (159) have unfree economies. \n\n  Sub-Saharan Africa \n\n  Sub-Saharan Africa remains the least free -- and by far the poorest -- area in the world. Of the 42 countries graded, none received a free rating. Only seven received a rating of mostly free, 28 were rated mostly unfree, and seven were rated repressed. Overall, 13 countries improved their scores this year while 15 nations saw their scores decline. \n\n  On a per capita basis, many sub-Saharan African countries are among those receiving the highest levels of economic assistance in the world. The index demonstrates that sub-Saharan Africa's poverty isn't the result of insufficient levels of foreign aid; rather, the main cause of poverty is the lack of economic freedom embodied in policies these countries have imposed on themselves, and the rampant corruption systemic there. \n\n  Asia and the Pacific \n\n  The Asian financial crisis has had a profound effect on the region. Countries that just a few years ago uniformly prospered now have gone in different directions due to policies pursued in reaction to the crisis. It's fair to say that for analytical purposes Asia as a whole no longer exists as a cohesive entity; it has fractured into subgroups of the economically free and unfree. Three of the four freest economies in the world are in Asia -- but so are eight of the world's 24 repressed economies. \n\n  Regionwide, five countries earned better scores this year but nine received worse ones, an overall regional decline in economic freedom. The decline was largely due to two factors: more government intervention in the economy and higher inflation. Taiwan (No. 11), Japan (19), South Korea (33), Thailand (46) and Indonesia (110) all declined, still reeling from the after-effects of policies enacted in the wake of the financial crisis. China's score (No. 100) rose due to significant improvement in inflation rates, but it still remains one of the most economically unfree countries in the world. \n\n  New Zealand (No. 3) and Australia (8), two of the brightest spots, represent the new, divergent Pacific region. Like other former British colonies that have adopted the Anglo-American capitalist model, they have experienced the success that comes from establishing an institutional backdrop for economic freedom -- such as the rule of law. This helped them weather the Asian financial crisis. \n\n  Hong Kong and Singapore still rank first and second, as they have in every past index. The editors of last year's index warned that Hong Kong might forfeit its top spot because of the government's intervention in the stock market in August 1998, but this year the government announced a plan to sell off its holdings. Singapore, which remains a close second, saw its score decline this year due to an increase in the marginal tax rate paid by the average taxpayer. \n\n  The fact that Hong Kong and Singapore have long ranked at the top of the index is testimony not only to their overall good policies, but also to the greater policy errors of other governments. Happily for the peoples of the world, more and more governments are adopting policies that promote economic freedom and long-run economic growth. Competition for the top rungs in the index ranking is increasing. \n\n  We look forward to chronicling this healthy competition to be the world's freest economy as we enter the 21st century. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 30, 1999 03:05 ET (08:05 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910778Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:42:32.605393Z", "inner_id": 173, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5542, "annotations": [{"id": 5479, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "WplKi8fPIi", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T10:47:25.915714Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:47:25.915741Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 292.596, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "9813dcca-2c95-4134-9f6a-3b1e37ebc0d0", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5542, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(11/15): REPEAT: `Emerging&apos; Bonds Rally Much Sooner Than Expected\n\n \n  By Pamela Druckerman \n  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  NEW YORK -- The rally that was expected to sweep emerging-market bonds early next year has happened ahead of schedule. \n\n  Several months ago, conventional wisdom on Wall Street was that emergingmarket bonds wouldn't come into favor until 2000, once fears about potential computer glitches had passed. But on Friday, the main emerging-markets index hit its strongest level in 15 months, capping a 6.7% total return since the beginning of October and the index's strongest year-to-date performance in three years. \n\n  \"I think the first-quarter rally is beginning to happen right now,\" says Joyce Chang, head of global bond research at Chase Securities Inc. \n\n  The jump reflects a rosier economic outlook for emerging markets and the perception that governments and big companies are reasonably well prepared to stave off year-2000 problems. Developing Asian countries are expected to see about 5.7% growth in gross domestic product this year and next, thanks partly to an economic uptick in Japan and the rebound in global-commodity prices. Russia, whose bonds have seen the sharpest gains this year, appears to be moving toward a long-awaited domestic-debt restructuring and the release of additional money from the International Monetary Fund. \n\n  And Latin America, whose government bonds comprise the bulk of J.P. Morgan's EMBI+ index, sidestepped the potentially nasty consequences of Brazil's sharp currency devaluation earlier this year. Although the region's major markets should contract slightly in 1999, they are expected to grow as much as 4% in 2000. \n\n  \"Most of the big macroeconomic blowups have already happened,\" says Peter Petas, chief emerging-markets debt strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. He says debt from weaker-credit countries such as Algeria and Nigeria has already begun to draw interest as overall confidence in emerging markets grows. \n\n  So far, emerging-market bonds have mostly attracted investors who specialize in the asset class, although traders say they are getting inquiries, and some orders, from nonspecialists drawn to the high yields. However, trading volume remains low. In the third quarter, emerging-market bond trading was 48% below levels of the same period in 1998, according to the Emerging Markets Traders Association, an industry group. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico accounted for more than two-thirds of all trading, EMTA reported. \n\n  If interest from the generalist investors turns into more than a nibble, the bonds could rally even more. David Sekiguchi, head of Latin American debt strategy at J.P. Morgan & Co., said interest rates on some emerging-market bonds will fall 2.7 percentage points by the end of next year, a sign of improved confidence. When investors assess the markets at year end, he expects them to recognize that developing-country debt outperformed every other major category of bonds, as well as many equity markets. \n\n  There is also hope that the rally in government bonds will spill into other emerging-market securities. Ms. Chang says Mexican corporate bonds, which yield three to five percentage points more than the country's sovereign debt, could be next in line for a price surge, as investors take more risks in search of higher yields. She is keen on companies with strong trade ties to the U.S., which she says have been overlooked due to general trepidation about the developing world. \n\n  It could also spread to better-rated countries that have been left behind by the rally, often because their bonds are less liquid. Ms. Chang says debt from smaller countries such as Colombia, Panama and Peru, which are better rated than Argentina and Brazil, should be destinations for \"crossover\" buyers, although they are inherently limited by the small amount of bonds outstanding. \n\n  (END) DOW JONES NEWS 11-15-99 \n\n   2 17 AM \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 15, 1999 06:22 ET (11:22 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:24.910837Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:47:26.135590Z", "inner_id": 174, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5543, "annotations": [{"id": 5480, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "itN2H268nw", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T10:51:28.323428Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:51:28.323464Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-27T10:51:27.818401Z", "lead_time": 241.516, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "44c1eb85-e46b-4b82-8ab2-49c99db9bbc9", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5543, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(11/15): Romania Faces Tough Decisions Over Economy\n\n \n  By Cristi Cretzan \n  Dow Jones Newswires \n\n  BUCHAREST -- The Romanian government faces an almost impossible task: balancing mounting protests from workers over the sharp deterioration in living standards with demands for budgetary discipline from international lenders. \n\n  As the government undertakes increasingly desperate attempts to revive its ailing economy, market observers say the International Monetary Fund should step in to help. \n\n  \"The IMF must do something if they want to maintain relations with this government,\" said Matthew Vogel, senior economist at Merrill Lynch International Ltd. in London. \n\n  Social pressures are rising as austerity measures have resulted in a dramatic drop in living standards. \n\n  In the past week, workers at truckmaker Roman SA stormed a local government building in the city of Brasov, railway workers blocked trains for hours in the capital's main rail station and steelworkers blocked a major road in northeastern Romania. Students took to the streets and declared strikes to demand higher grants. \n\n  \"It is normal to have these protests as the government must do so much in so little time,\" said Sonja Gibbs, a London-based economist at Nomura International. \n\n  The IMF has taken a first step toward releasing more funds to Romania by agreeing to ease the requirement that Romania has to raise $470 million from the private sector before a second tranche of a $547 million standby loan is released. \n\n  Although no new amount was set, National Bank of Romania officials hope a loan of about $100 million, underwritten by foreign banks active in Romania, will be enough to satisfy the IMF board. \n\n  \"We will have details on the loan in a few days and we will have this condition fulfilled,\" central bank chief economist Valentin Lazea said. \n\n  The release of the $200 million second tranche would trigger the release of loans worth $500 million from the World Bank and European Union. \n\n  But budgetary concerns remain for the IMF, particularly after the government of Prime Minister Radu Vasile approved a pay raise for army and police and fuel subsidies for the agricultural sector. \n\n  The IMF has asked for clarification on the measures, although government officials claim they won't affect this year's budget. The budget deficit is still seen at 3.9% of gross domestic product, as agreed with the IMF. \n\n  The government has tried to defuse tensions by offering other kinds of compensation than money, although this could trigger more criticism from the IMF. \n\n  At debt-ridden Roman, the government decided to offset part of the company's government debts by taking delivery of 420 trucks for the army and police. It also exempted Roman from paying duties on imported spare parts in 2000. \n\n  Romania is scheduled to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in the fall of 2000, and the opposition leftist Social Democracy party, together with ex-President Ion Iliescu, a former communist leader, enjoy a comfortable lead in opinion polls. \n\n  Merril Lynch's Mr. Vogel argues that the IMF should continue to encourage the government even if it doesn't immediately release the second tranche. \n\n  \"It is necessary to show that they believe in the [government's] program,\" he said. \"They must come back in Bucharest and work on the 2000 budget.\" \n\n  However, Mr. Vogel said Romania should qualify for the tranche considering its good work this year. Foreign-exchange reserves at the central bank stood at $1.56 billion at the end of October, after falling below $800 million in June. \n\n  The current account deficit should be halved this year to $1.5 billion from $3 billion in 1998, helped by the gradual depreciation of the leu. The Romanian currency is expected to depreciate in real terms by 10% to 15% this year. \n\n  Still, the government will fail to meet its inflation target of 40.6% as agreed to with the IMF. But the central bank's Mr. Lazea said this will have little impact on the IMF's decision. He said Romania will work to keep the year-on-year inflation rate at the end of 1999 at below 50%, meaning a monthly inflation rate of about 2% in the remaining two months of 1999. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 15, 1999 03:09 ET (08:09 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.241613Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:51:28.557206Z", "inner_id": 175, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5544, "annotations": [{"id": 5481, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "ZqoexdLsbQ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T10:54:40.448053Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T10:54:40.448089Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 191.139, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f6e8765a-964e-47b1-b270-da8a02b326b4", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5544, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(12/27): McTeer Joined Others In Vote On Fed-Funds Target\n\n \n  By John D. McKinnon \n  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  WASHINGTON -- Evidence of inflation might still be scant, but the risk in November was enough to convince even the most reluctant Federal Reserve policy maker of the need to raise rates. \n\n  According to minutes of their Nov. 16 meeting -- which were released Thursday after the customary delay -- Robert McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, voted with all other Fed policy makers to increase the target for federal funds by a quarter point to 5.5%. Mr. McTeer had cast the sole vote against two previous rate increases, in June and August, based on his desire to test the economy's growth limits. \n\n  This time, according to the minutes, Mr. McTeer joined other policy makers who worried that the red-hot economy's increasing demand for workers could force labor costs to rise, while some of the factors that had held down other costs -- such as low energy prices and low demand overseas -- were turning around. \n\n  \"On balance . . . the unsustainable pace of economic expansion along with the reversal of factors that previously had held down overall price increases suggested a significant risk that inflation would strengthen over time given prevailing financial conditions,\" the minutes say. \n\n  Against that background, all the members supported \"a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy\"the minutes say. \n\n  The officials also expressed \"broad agreement\" on \"tentative recommendations\" to change post-meeting statements of the policy-making committee concerning its \"bias\" on the direction of interest rates, though the minutes don't mention any specific proposals.

But energy prices climbed 1.8%. Food prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.1%. Overall producer prices jumped 2.7% compared with November 1998. \n\n  The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was flat for the month. Since the core rate is often what economists examine when trying to predict the scope of price pressures, they took Friday's report as another sign that Federal Reserve policy makers won't raise interest rates when they meet Dec. 21. \n\n  \"It will suggest to officials that although inflation risks are on the high side, we have not seen any stirring yet on that front,\" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. \n\n  Even before Friday's report was released, analysts had predicted that Fed officials would be reluctant to raise interest rates this month because of concerns about possible Y2K-related glitches. \"The Fed probably prefers to stay on the sidelines,\" said Jeffrey Palma, economist at Warburg Dillon Read, Stamford, Conn. But Fed officials may switch their so-called bias -- their declaration of which way they are leaning on interest-rate policy -- toward tightening, he said. \n\n  Mr. Palma also said Fed policy makers will give more weight to upcoming reports on retail sales and consumer prices than to Friday's producer-price data. \"So far, consumer and producer prices have been very well behaved,\" he said. \n\n  Many finished goods that caused concern in the October report showed smaller increases in November. Prices for passenger cars, for example, rose 0.2% after a 1.1% increase in October. Prescription drugs, light trucks and household furniture all fell in November after rising the previous month. Durable manufacturing materials rose 0.2% last month after a 0.6% increase the previous month. \n\n  For all the good news, the new report contained some evidence of price pressure. Prices of intermediate goods rose 0.3% for the third month in a row, while crude-goods prices rose 4% after falling 1.6% the previous month. \n\n  As for energy prices, intermediate energy goods rose 1.8% in November, after increasing just 0.2% in October. Crude energy materials shot up 8.8% last month, after falling 4.8% the previous month. Electric power rose 0.7% and liquefied petroleum gas jumped 2.3%. \n\n  Even when the more volatile sectors are excluded, producer prices are inching up. The core rate of inflation for finished goods was up 1.9% for the 12 months ended in November, compared with an increase of 1.7% for the 12 months ended in October. Among finished-goods prices, eggs rose 22% last month following a 16.3% drop in October. Passenger-car radial tires rose 3.6% in November after a 2.5% decline the previous month. \n\n  Mr. Moran sees higher inflation on the horizon. \"You're seeing some important changes take place-foreign economies are improving, which will lift demand all over the world,\" he said. \"You could see the inflation rate in the U.S. creep higher.\" \n\n  Meanwhile, although consumers remain positive about the economy, their enthusiasm appears to be slipping from recent highs. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment decreased to 104.2 in November from 107.2 the previous month.

As a result, the president may soon start yet another round of campaigning - not just for the presidency, but for his coalition members who aim to land seats in federal and state legislatures, governorships and municipalities. \n\n  At the same time, Venezuela's economic problems are severe. Despite a tripling in the price of its oil basket from year lows in the first quarter, some believe the petroleum-rich country's economy will still contract 5% to 7% this year. \n\n  Unemployment stands at 20%. But the figure actually masks just how dire the country's labor situation really is: Only 36% of Venezuela's labor force is fully employed with benefits, according to Cenda, a labor market research house. \n\n  \"It's not possible to wait any longer to confront such problems,\" Domingo Maza, a central bank director, told Dow Jones Newswires. \n\n  Fiscal Faucets Seen Flowing Ahead Of Elections \n\n  While by no means a long-term solution, a quick-fix may be in the offing. \n\n  Thanks to oil, and the revenues it generates for the government, analysts reckon the Chavez administration has the resources to stimulate the economy. And with elections ahead, it also has the incentive. \n\n  Government officials project economic growth of 2.2% next year. Luis Vicente Leon, a director at Datanalisis, an economic and social polling firm, says growth will be higher, perhaps even 4%. \n\n  Leon is convinced that the government will open the fiscal faucet ahead of the elections to kick-start the economy, so that Chavez and his coalition allies will be able to bank on the improved sentiment that increased cash flow usually produces. \n\n  But analysts and business leaders alike say an intravenous money line for public works isn't enough to revive the ailing economy. Sustained growth, they argue, can only come if the private sector is permitted to flourish. For that to happen, the laws needed to apply the new constitution will have to provide a solid margin for the private sector to operate, they say. \n\n  While the private sector had its objections to the new constitution, it now has hopes that future legislators will also promote \"the important role of the private sector recognized in the constitution,\" said Pedro Carmona, vice-president of Fedecamaras, the country's largest business chamber. \n\n  Fedecamaras and other business chambers are urging the drafting of laws to mitigate articles relating to high severance pay, restrictive labor laws, a stiff tributary regime and a pervasive presence of the state as participant, planner and regulator in a slew of economic sectors. \n\n  The new constitutional articles relating to social security and education are meanwhile phrased to suggest that the state assumes full and exclusive responsibility, with even non-contributors to social security being guaranteed benefits. \n\n  Economists point out the state-run social security system is already effectively bankrupt and public health services notoriously poor. They say the added costs of honoring all the social guarantees in the new constitution could rise to 30% of gross domestic product over the next few years - outlays they maintain the government can't begin to afford. \n\n  Central Bank Hopes For Legally Defined Autonomy \n\n  Leading proponents of the constitution, including constitutional assembly President Luis Miquilena and Alfredo Pena, the head of the assembly's economic commission, have already said amendments can be made. \n\n  On Tuesday Chavez told foreign reporters that the constitutional guarantees wouldn't be applied overnight, and that employers and employees would have to join the state in making the new social and labor systems work. \n\n  Yet hopes for legislative changes aren't limited to the private sector. Maza said the central bank is also hoping for modifications. \n\n  For instance, while one constitutional article provides for the bank's autonomy, another stipulates that it must coordinate its monetary policy with the Treasury's fiscal policy. The constitution also requires the legislature to approve not only central bank directors but also its budget. \n\n  \"We hope the Central Bank Law, to be drafted within a year, will correct the inappropriate aspects (of the constitution) which could affect the bank's autonomy and monetary policy,\" said the bank's Maza. \n\n  That autonomy, he added, \"is fundamental in the fight against inflation.\" \n\n  Social Program Can't Advance Without Economic Growth \n\n  But broadly speaking, Maza said he's optimistic that with the vote on the new constitution over, the country's political and economic paralysis should end. \n\n  \"The political panorama is clearing in good measure,\" he said. \"So now the economic action of the government will have priority.\" \n\n  He added that upcoming political campaigns will have a \"different tonality\" than the one preceding the vote on the constitution. \"There is now a national consensus as to the necessity to reactivate the economy,\" he said. \n\n  In Maza's view, at least, that consensus supercedes the elections. Thus when financial markets reopen Friday after having stayed closed Thursday because of massive flooding in several parts of the country, he expects improved performance in both the bourse and the country's debt. \n\n  In New York Thursday, Venezuelan Brady bonds had a muted reaction to the passing of the constitution. The country's DCB bonds were up 1/4 to 79 bid in late activity, while bonds maturing in 2027 were off 1/8 to 65 7/16 bid. \n\n  Fedecamaras' Carmona wouldn't speculate on how local financial markets might react to Wednesday's vote. But most dealers and analysts say Venezuelan asset values should rise in the short term, now that the country's political and institutional framework has been in large part defined. \n\n  In the long term, however, financial markets will reflect performance in the broader economy.

Mr. Lannan, who works for telecommunications giant Lucent Technologies Inc., answered with pride: \"I'm the director of capital markets at Lucent.\" \n\n  Uncomfortable silence. Blank stares. The conversation quickly shifted to the weather. \"People always think the title sounds important, but they don't know what I actually do,\" says Mr. Lannan. \n\n  Mr. Lannan and other executives who decide when companies should sell bonds to investors, and how much they should sell, will never be the life of the party in the real world. But in corporate America, and to an extent on Wall Street, they're increasingly getting respect. \n\n  That's because the bond market has been as tough on the nerves as a fourth cup of coffee, and executives who guessed right and sold a ton of bonds at just the right time saved their companies hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\n  Consider AT&T Corp.'s decision in March to sell $8 billion of bonds, shattering the record for the biggest bond deal on record. Some on Wall Street questioned the wisdom of raising so much money then, after interest rates had already moved higher. But rates have continued to climb, and the move now looks like a savvy one: If AT&T were to sell the same amount of bonds today it would have to pay $86 million a year more in interest payments over the next 30 years, a whopping $680 million in today's dollars. \n\n  Lucent itself sold $1.4 billion of bonds at a yield of 6.50% in March, after Mr. Lannan's team, together with Chief Financial Officer Don Pederson, determined that the economy would keep growing, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to keep inflation at bay. \n\n  The Fed proceeded to raise interest rates three times this year, and bond investors have gone through periods in which they fled from all kinds of bonds, including Lucent's. In fact, to get the same deal done today, the company would have to pay investors a yield of about 7.20% on its bonds, meaning Lucent saved about $11 million a year for the next 30 years, or about $138 million in today's dollars. \n\n  Treasurers, directors of capital markets and even chief financial officers often make these gutsy bets and can save their companies piles of money. But while chief executive officers get lots of credit for savvy strategic decisions, and many are even household names - think Michael Eisner, Bill Gates and John Welch - finance executives are often only recognized within their own households. \n\n  \"It's not as bad as being a proctologist, but it's right up there,\" says Mr. Pederson of Lucent. Capital-raising is \"taken for granted if it's done well, but if we screw up everyone knows about it.\" \n\n  To be sure, a growing number of chief financial officers have made a name for themselves and gone on to high-profile jobs heading or helping to run companies. Douglas Ivester was the CFO of Coca-Cola Co. before eventually becoming chief executive. Jerome York was the chief financial officer of Chrysler Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. before leaving to become vice chairman of Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. \n\n  And thanks in part to savvy financing moves, Daniel E. Somers, AT&T's chief financial officer at the time of its bond deal, last week was named president and chief executive of AT&T Broadband & Internet Services, which manages the company's cable initiatives. Some even see him as a possible successor of AT&T Chairman Michael Armstrong. \n\n  To executives charged with running capital-raising efforts, the stakes are high. \"I live and die on these decisions,\" Mr. Somers said in an interview earlier this year, noting that his boss, Mr. Armstrong, encouraged AT&T's decision to jump into the bond market. \n\n  Roy Guthrie, chief financial officer at Associates First Capital Corp., says: \"In my chair, you sweat\" having to decide when to issue bonds and how much to sell. \n\n  Mr. Guthrie should know. He says some investment bankers second-guessed Associates' decision to sell $7.3 billion of fixed-rate bonds between October 1998 and June of this year. But the company has saved $77 million a year over 20 years, $383 million in today's dollars, by acting before rates jumped and investors turned lukewarm to corporate bonds. \n\n  \"Many companies got caught by paying up for financing in the third quarter but we didn't have to,\" he says. \n\n  Companies with heavy financing needs that go to the bond market regularly don't have the luxury of timing the bond market. They usually pay Wall Street firms to swap their interest-rate payments for floating-rate payments that move with interest rates. But companies without pressing needs can be choosier. Finance executives like Mr. Lannan gather intelligence on the future of rates, polling investors, Wall Street traders and analysts, with the goal of getting to the bond market when bonds are selling like hotcakes, and yields are low, rather than hot potatoes. \n\n  \"We're involved in various parts of the economy so we have a view\" of the future of interest rates, says Scott McCarthy, senior vice president of capital markets at Associates. \n\n  The task is crucial, Wall Street analysts say. The stock market tends to focus on high-profile acquisitions and new-product announcements, says Blake Bath of Lehman Brothers, \"but AT&T can save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of its bond issue and people don't appreciate that.\" \n\n  So what should companies eager to raise money do now? Head for the bond market, say top financing executives. The economy shows few signs of slowing and the Fed may have to raise rates several times next year to keep inflation under wraps. Unless you can wait until the economy slows, perhaps during the second half of the year, sell your bonds now. \n\n  \"Rates are heading higher and we see several more Fed [rate increases] in the cards,\" says Mr. Lannan of Lucent. \"There's good demand from investors right now\" so companies should sell bonds now, rather than later. \n\n  Adds Mr. Guthrie of Associates: \"Pricing power will manifest itself in inflationary biases\" in the next year, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond above 6.50%. \n\n  Associates is set to follow its own advice. \"We're going to be pretty aggressive out of the gate in year 2000 about raising money,\" says Mr. Guthrie. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 14, 1999 00:25 ET (05:25 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.241807Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T11:07:49.798159Z", "inner_id": 179, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5548, "annotations": [{"id": 5485, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "f8nbApwJzw", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T11:08:06.301302Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T11:08:06.301328Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-27T11:08:06.067241Z", "lead_time": 15.839, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "547e865a-7d6c-4bfb-b907-6b1e88262d0f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5548, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(12/9): IPO Scorecard / Update On Selected New Issues\n\n \n\n  From The Wall Street Journal \n\n  IPO investors have continued their post-Thanksgiving deal-feast.

Libya, Iraq and Iran, all price hawks on production matters, mounted a short-lived campaign for a cut of 1.7 million barrels a day. But Saudi Arabia, which accounts for nearly a third of OPEC output, prevailed. \n\n  Lower production quotas are intended to keep oil prices at about $30 a barrel for the U.S. benchmark, West Texas intermediate crude. But uncertainties in global oil markets, including how much oil Iraq actually exports in the next few months, mean OPEC's action is probably just the first of several output adjustments it will make this year. \"We may have to do more, or we may have to do less,\" said Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister. \n\n  Mr. Naimi and other OPEC ministers contend that the slowing U.S. economy, coupled with a downturn in demand that accompanies the end of the northern winter, will lead to a drop in demand by as much as three million barrels a day. That could mean another cut when OPEC meets here again on March 16. \"We were forced to cut at this meeting in order to avoid a price crash in the second quarter,\" said Ali Rodriguez, OPEC's secretary-general and a former Venezuelan oil minister. \"And we will cut by one million barrels a day in March if prices continue to fall.\" \n\n  With the latest cut, OPEC output, excluding Iraq, will decline to 25.2 million barrels a day. Oil futures fell yesterday on the news of the cut. West Texas intermediate crude dropped 69 cents to $29.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. \n\n  Analysts say yesterday's meeting illustrates OPEC's willingness to make risky decisions to prevent a price collapse. \"If OPEC is going to take risks, it's going to take them on the upside rather than the downside,\" said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst at Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. \n\n  OPEC's success in managing markets hinges heavily on Iraqi oil exports, which have been disrupted since the beginning of December. Iraqi officials say their country will resume exports of as much as 2.4 million barrels a day by the end of January. In the meantime, the intermittent nature of Iraqi exports since December -- because of spats over sales terms with buyers and the United Nations, which regulates Iraqi oil exports -- has made it difficult to ascertain just how much oil Baghdad is pumping. \n\n  But many in the industry figure Iraq has been exporting fewer than 500,000 barrels a day on average. When Iraq resumes its full exports, it alone will more than offset the reduction that OPEC agreed to yesterday. \n\n  Should Iraq resume exports, the U.S. economy continue to slow and seasonal demand drop as expected, OPEC may in fact see a glut. Industry experts expect non-OPEC oil output -- the North Sea, the U.S., Latin America and elsewhere -- to meet demand growth this year. That would mean OPEC, which added 3.7 million barrels of oil a day in the past year, would almost certainly have to keep cutting production to keep prices up. \n\n  OPEC oil ministers say they won't allow prices to drop just to give a boost to the U.S. economy. In fact, OPEC ministers say higher oil prices are not contributing to the slowdown, even while industry experts argue the opposite. \n\n  \"Economies go up and down,\" said Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, oil minister for the United Arab Emirates. \"I don't think oil is responsible.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 17, 2001 19:49 ET (00:49 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.241876Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T11:16:50.795349Z", "inner_id": 181, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5550, "annotations": [{"id": 5487, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "oj5gotbaEQ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T11:17:53.211371Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T11:17:53.211397Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 61.67, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a310f043-62cf-44f0-87c8-0933cec4edc7", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5550, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Cargill Halts Production At Corn Processing Plant\n\n \n \n\n  FARGO, N.D.

When the lights went out in California, a lot more people understood that how electric utilities are regulated matters to how we live, work and play. \n\n  In the darkness, however, some people rushed to familiar ideological corners. \n\n  One corner says that only if prices go high enough for long enough will consumers use less electricity and investors build more power plants. Painfully high prices now, this argument goes, will allow California to live happily ever after as demand and supply meet at a lower price in the future, however distant. \n\n  The other corner says the California mess proves that the market doesn't work. Never mind that California hardly let market forces act unfettered. This camp looks longingly for restored government control. \n\n  Believing firmly in one or the other school can blind you to workable solutions. Two examples: \n\n  First, should the federal government set ceilings on wholesale electric rates in the West? The market camp says, \"No!\" Backed by the Bush administration, it argues that temporary controls inevitably become permanent and that controls always discourage new supply. All good arguments, but not the right answer in a half-regulated, half-unregulated market for electricity. \n\n  \"If the price goes to $100,000 a megawatt, is that going to increase the speed with which they build a new power plant in California?\" asks Paul Joskow, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology energy economist. Not likely. \n\n  Second, should customers have to pay more for electricity at those moments when it costs more to make or buy it? The reregulate camp says, \"No!\" Yet experience in other states shows that answer is wrong. \n\n  What happens in California will shape the way the rest of the U.S. approaches electricity regulation. If California gets much messier, any remaining political support for deregulating elsewhere will vanish. \n\n \n\n  THE CASE FOR MARKETS is strong: They are better than bureaucrats at getting goods to those who will make the best use of them because they are willing to pay the most. That insight may finally dawn on Sacramento politicians as they wrestle with the fundamental issue: California is short of power. \n\n  Electricity is hard to store; it is produced as needed. Customers want it instantly and without restriction; no busy signals allowed. And utilities need generating capacity to meet demand at the one moment of peak usage, the summer afternoon when everyone turns up his air conditioner. Utilities save the least-efficient plants for those peaks. \n\n  For more than 25 years, clever economists and clearheaded regulators have been urging utilities to charge lots more during peak hours so big business customers shift demand to other periods, when power is cheaper than average. The lower the peak, the less need for new power plants. \n\n  \"It's pretty much in everyone's interest,\" says Severin Borenstein, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. He is pushing California to adopt this \"real-time pricing\" technique and sees a pinprick of light in the darkness. \n\n  Although the technology is available, few U.S. utilities have moved aggressively to real-time pricing. California has been especially reluctant. \"Under the old regulatory regime,\" Mr. Borenstein says, \"the more real-time pricing and reduction of demand on peak, the fewer generation facilities you got to build.\" And utilities existed to build plants. \n\n \n\n  THAT DAY IS GONE. And the success of pioneering utilities is instructive. At 4 p.m. this afternoon, Southern Co.'s Georgia Power Co. will send 1,600 big customers 24 separate prices for each hour tomorrow. For very big, and very flexible, customers, it offers a new price every hour; at 10 a.m., it tells them what power will cost between 11 a.m. and noon. At crunch time, prices can be as much as 50 times normal. \n\n  \"At first, many customers say, `There's nothing I can do to change my consumption,' \" says Michael O'Sheasy, the utility's project-design manager. \"But after a while, the creativity is amazing.\" \n\n  An insulation maker shifted production to a Wednesday-Sunday schedule. Grocers turned their freezers on extra cold before a peak period, and turned them off when power was pricey. A factory built inventory in anticipation of a price peak so it could turn off an energy-greedy machine during the expensive hours. Others used their own generators when Georgia Power's electricity was expensive. Georgia Power routinely sheds 800 megawatts of demand when prices get high -- a big deal for a utility with a 15,000-megawatt peak. \n\n  In the same spirit, Exelon Corp.'s ComEd unit pays big Chicago customers to voluntarily turn off the power at peak periods, much as airlines offer bribes to surrender seats on overbooked flights. The payment is linked to the price of power on the spot market. Other utilities have similar programs but don't offer big enough bribes or do enough marketing to lure substantial numbers of customers. When necessary, ComEd can shed 1,200 megawatts of demand, the output of a big nuclear plant. \n\n  While electricity was cheap, few top executives were interested in experimenting. New energy retailers were more interested in market share than managing demand. Old utilities were worried about the thinner profit margins that come with shifting risk from supplier to customer. \n\n  California changes everything. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 07, 2001 23:01 ET (04:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242037Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T11:22:25.682102Z", "inner_id": 186, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5555, "annotations": [{"id": 5492, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "-vV4e_-JPr", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T15:04:55.662698Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T15:04:55.662715Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 2014.643, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "6af83e2a-480e-483a-8ee8-11539fcf932f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5555, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Turkey&apos;s Lira Crisis Could Empty The Shops Of Intl Goods\n\n \n\n  By Selim Atalay \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n  ISTANBUL (Dow Jones)--The rapid devaluation of the Turkish lira since its float Thursday is threatening to empty the shops. \n\n  Just two working days after its free float, the lira has lost 36% against the dollar, and many international companies have stopped supplying goods to local retailers until the currency stabilizes, and they can plan a sensible pricing policy. \n\n  \"We stopped shipping to the local chains,\" said the Istanbul executive of a major multinational fast-moving consumer goods company, who declined to be named. \"Supplying in this environment doesn't make sense.\" Many international suppliers typically spend dollars on imports and are then paid in lira by local retailers 90 to 120 days after shipment. \n\n  \"There's too much risk of selling below cost and remaining exposed to the currency,\" said the executive, who predicted that the existing stocks in the supermarkets would last about two weeks. \n\n  On Saturday, famous retail chains at a mall in Istanbul were offering 30% to 50% discounts for cash purchasers. \n\n  \"We need to revise our pricing policy; maybe we'll issue monthly prices,\" another leading international company retail executive added. \"We did the same in Mexico during their crisis...But first the dust needs to settle before we can see ahead.\" He also declined to be named. \n\n  The dust is far from settling.

Interbank rates Friday were around TRL1,250,000. \n\n  So far the casualties of the crisis have been restricted to monetary officials and Central Bank governor Gazi Ercel, who has already resigned. The markets are waiting to see if there will be political scalps, too. \n\n  Oil companies, which don't want to shoulder the political risk of locking the country out with a fuel shortage, have been extending credit to retailers, however. \n\n  \"We are continuing to supply fuel to the stations,\" said an executive of an oil major, who also asked for anonymity. \"We're selling at the pre-crisis prices.\" \n\n  Another food retail executive said: \"Next week is crucial, as it will give us a sense on how things may develop.\" \n\n  From March 2 through March 12, Turkey enjoys a long religious holiday.

Earlier this month Kufuor told parliament that the previous government spent GHC6 billion a day subsidizing petrol. \n\n  Ghana's economy has deteriorated badly over the past 18 months, as increases in world prices of oil, its main import, coincide with a sharp fall in international cocoa and gold prices, its two main exports. \n\n  The government alleges former President Jerry Rawlings delayed increasing fuel prices in order to win votes for his party in December elections. \n\n  Last week, Kufuor led a team to Abuja, Nigeria, to negotiate for fuel imports under a 90-day repayment agreement. \n\n  The country's main trade union body, the Trade Union Congress, warned Thursday that any price increases in fuel should be done gradually and should be accompanied by a raise in workers' salaries. \n\n  -By Kwasi Kpodo, Dow Jones Newswires; 225 22 41 03 17; adadson@ap.org \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 24, 2001 11:14 ET (16:14 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242098Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T15:05:31.914916Z", "inner_id": 188, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5557, "annotations": [{"id": 5494, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "HvPgxaXXjB", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T15:06:28.057751Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T15:06:28.057777Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 55.056, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "45ee4530-3c48-418e-ac47-137d5f63790d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5557, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Charting Europe: April IPE Brent Crude Capped At $29\n\n \n \n   By Axel Rudolph, MSTA \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The charts are pointing to at least a short-term consolidation for the Brent crude price on the International Petroleum Exchange. \n\n  Currently trading at around $27.65, April Brent has been coming off its recent relative high at $29.15 and is probably going to retrace towards at least $26.50 within the next few days. \n\n  The combination of a loss in momentum, a bearish crossover in the highly overbought modified stochastic and a \"Bearish Engulfing\" pattern in a high probability trend-reversal time zone all indicate lower prices to come. \n\n  Following the rally from $22.90, Brent Crude came close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $29.42, taken from the all time high to December low. The fact that it only briefly traded above $29 without reaching the Fibonacci level and then closed below the $29 mark points to a spike reversal having formed. \n\n  Furthermore the \"Bearish Engulfing\" pattern on the daily Japanese Candlestick chart Friday, formed a day after the spike to $29.15, is a potential trend-reversal pattern. \n\n  For the time being no reversal of the medium-term trend is anticipated. \n\n  A correction towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracements of last year's October to December decline as well as of the current advance, at $26.92 and $26.76 respectively, are likely, however. \n\n  This price zone also encompasses the Dec. 11 and Dec. 12 highs, adding further support and making it a target on the chart. \n\n  Since Brent is still within its December and January uptrend channels, technical analysis favors the trend to continue and the market to simply correct to the lower boundaries of these channels. \n\n  They currently come in around $26.00 and $25.50. Only a daily close below the $25.50 major support zone, at $25.00 or lower, would reverse the current uptrend. \n\n  A consolidation is probable though, as the recent high has been made at a critical juncture in time from where at least short-term corrections to a trend have occurred in the past. \n\n  This time zone is where the duraction of the November to December 2000 bear move has been multiplied by 1.618 to provide the next possible high. \n\n  In the case of April Brent crude, the November to December decline lasted for 23 days. The recent high was formed after 37 days (1.618*23), taken from the Dec. 20 closing low. This time level coincides perfectly with the Feb. 8 high. \n\n  Furthermore the daily momentum has slowed over the past few days after having reached extreme levels from where recent corrections or trend-reversals have been made. \n\n  Also the %K and %D lines of the modified stochastic have just crossed in the highly overbought 80% zone and are now pointing down, further adding to a probable consolidation. \n\n  All relative highs since June 2000 have been made from the 75%-90% overbought zone in the modified stochastic. Therefore, the probability of another relative high having just taken place above $29 is high and a correction is in the making. \n\n  -By Axel Rudolph, MSTA, Dow Jones Newswires; 44 20 7842 9494; axel.rudolph@dowjones.com \n\n  Axel Rudolph is Dow Jones' Chief Technical Analyst for Europe. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 13, 2001 05:30 ET (10:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242130Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T15:06:28.262489Z", "inner_id": 189, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5558, "annotations": [{"id": 5495, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "eW6pG3NOYp", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T15:06:51.840885Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T15:06:51.840910Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 22.689, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "b46e1f20-8b1f-4e5f-b868-e3fdd71fd69b", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5558, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UK Npower To Up Domestic Gas Bills By 4.5% From April 13\n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Npower, retail arm of the U.K.'s Innogy Holdings PLC (IOG), Friday said it will increase domestic gas prices by 4.5% from April 13 due to \"volatile market conditions.\" \n\n  However, the company said new customers signing up for dual fuel before April 13 would be protected from rising gas prices until March 2003. \n\n  The company's decision follows similar price increases announced by the U.K.'s two largest suppliers Centrica PLC (U.CTR) and TXU Europe, a unit of TXU Corp.

Producers are only starting to rebuild herds that they thinned because of drought and low prices in the late 1990s. \n\n  The winter has been so cold and damp that cattle are taking several months longer than usual to fatten up. In bad weather, cattle in feedlots don't eat as much and use up energy staying warm. \n\n  \"We have basically had one of the harshest winters that we have seen in a very long time,\" said Chuck Levitt, a meat analyst with Chicago-based Alaron Trading Corp. \"The last time we had a winter this severe across the major cattle feeding areas was in 1993.\" \n\n  The previous record for retail prices was in September, at $3.13 a pound. In the late 1990s, they were averaging about $2.80. \n\n  Live cattle are selling for 82 cents a pound, up from 78 cents last month and about 68 cents in February 2000. \n\n  \"We've definitely seen the beef prices go up big time,\" said Rickey Figueroa, executive chef of Atlanta's Chops Steakhouse. \n\n  The price the upscale restaurant is paying for beef tenderloin has gone from $15 to $20 a pound in recent weeks. So far, the restaurant isn't changing its menu prices, in hopes of negotiating better deals with another supplier, Figueroa said. \n\n  Americans have rediscovered a taste for beef at the same time that U.S. meat exports are up and many producers have been sending all of their calves to slaughter, rather than holding females back for breeding. \n\n  Experts say it's too early to assess the impact on U.S. prices and supplies from outbreaks of mad-cow and foot-and-mouth diseases in Europe. \n\n  Beef sales plummeted in the European Union after an upsurge of mad cow cases in several countries last year. Since October, beef prices in Europe have fallen by about 27%. \n\n  The European Union doesn't buy most U.S. beef because the cattle are treated with growth hormones. \n\n  In the United States, \"The prices are up because the stock of cattle in the country is way down,\" said Mark McLaughlin, who ranches near Sweetwater, Texas, in a region that has been through several years of drought. \"I bet in this area of Texas we've gotten down to 30%\" of normal herd sizes. \n\n  McLaughlin sent 450 calves to feedlots this winter so they could be fattened for slaughter. That's about half the cattle he was selling a few years ago when his herds were larger. Last fall, however, he kept some female calves so he could start rebuilding his herd over the next two years to take advantage of the higher prices. \n\n  U.S. cattle supplies are down 1% this year and 6% from a peak in 1996. \n\n  Beef consumption, meanwhile, reached 99.5 pounds per person last year, up from 98.7 per person the year before and 95.6 pounds in 1997. U.S. beef sales to Japan and other export markets rose 11% in 1999 and another 4% last year. \n\n  \"Demand is holding up very strongly,\" said Agriculture Department analyst Ron Gustafson. \n\n  Retail prices will likely moderate as the weather warms and more cattle head to slaughter, but then cattle supplies will tighten over the next two years as ranchers retain their female calves, rather than send them for slaughter, he said. \n\n  On the Net: USDA's Economic Research Service: http://www.ers.usda.gov \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 05, 2001 20:07 ET (01:07 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242191Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:08:20.719486Z", "inner_id": 191, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5560, "annotations": [{"id": 5497, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "qUPn4Qmiqr", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T17:10:00.770288Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:10:00.770323Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 99.203, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "85a3c4ac-a70e-466c-a117-da48276ccbf0", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5560, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Calif Assembly OKs Investigating Power Plant Outages\n\n \n \n\n  SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)--The California Assembly took several steps Thursday to cope with California's energy crisis, passing bills that would regulate power plant outages and expand utility programs that cut rates for big power users who turn off electricity when needed. \n\n  A measure by Assemblywoman Carole Migden would give the overseer of the state power grid authority to coordinate plant outages to prevent too many from going off line for maintenance at any one time. \n\n  If a power plant seemed to have too many outages or was shut down for a suspicious length of time, the grid manager, the Independent System Operator, could investigate and the state Electricity Oversight Board could order fines. \n\n  \"We have suspected that in some instances these generators have shut down and this has not been in the public interest,\" said Migden, D-San Francisco, adding that she was not accusing anyone of wrongdoing. \"What we're trying to do is create an audit and accountability system.\" \n\n  The bill largely puts into state law an executive order issued last month by Gov. Gray Davis and goes further by giving the Electricity Oversight Board the power to issue fines. The fines would be based on the cost of power the ISO had to buy as a result of a plant's shutdown. \n\n  Senate leader John Burton on Wednesday announced a Senate committee will investigate whether electricity wholesalers illegally withheld power to drive up prices. \n\n  He cited plant outages for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance that have contributed to supply shortfalls, forcing the ISO to scramble for power at premium prices to meet demand. \n\n  Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Reliant Energy (REI) will be among major providers included in the Senate inquiry, said Committee Chairman Joe Dunn. \n\n  Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers industry group, said wholesalers will cooperate, but warned that if it becomes a \"witch hunt\" it could discourage them from building plants in California. \n\n  A similar Assembly panel has been formed to look into natural gas prices. The probes could lead to action by the state attorney general. \n\n  The Federal Regulatory Energy Commission on Wednesday ordered Williams Cos. (WMB) unit Williams Energy Marketing & Trading and AES Corp. (AES) unit AES Southland to show why they should not be forced to refund $10.8 million to California utilities for taking generating units in Long Beach and Huntington Beach off line last April and May. \n\n  That follows a FERC order last week directing wholesalers to refund $69 million in California electricity charges or demonstrate why the charges were justified. FERC, a strong supporter of deregulation, has given the companies until March 23 to appeal that decision. \n\n  The Assembly approved Migden's plant outage bill 57-5 and sent it to the Senate. \n\n  The Assembly also sent the Senate two measures on investor-owned utilities' interruptible-service programs, which give non-residential utility customers discounted rates if they agree to shut down during periods of tight power supplies. Both votes were 67-0. \n\n  The programs are considered key tools for avoiding rolling blackouts this summer, when air conditioning and other power use is expected to further strap the state's electricity supply. \n\n  The Assembly approved a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, that would extend the programs until the end of 2002 and require investor-owned utilities to offer customers more ways to participate. \n\n  It also passed a measure by Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher, R-Brea, that would let those in such programs for at least a year that have been barred by the state Public Utilities Commission from getting out of them opt out without penalty. \n\n  Customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.

Thomas Sims \n  Staff Reporter \n\n  FRANKFURT -- Unfazed by falling stock markets, the European Central Bank, as expected, left interest rates steady because the bank still detects some inflation risks. \n\n  The ECB didn't explain the decision taken at a regular policy meeting, but recent comments from officials indicate the ECB still fears workers may demand higher wages that could stoke inflation. The trickle-down effect on consumer prices from last year's oil-price increase and a weaker euro still concerns the ECB, as does increased government spending. \n\n  Unlike in the U.S., dramatic falls in European share prices have little bearing on the broader economy here. European firms don't rely as heavily on stock markets for financing. Stock market capitalization in Europe is only 66% of ouput, half the level of the U.S., according to ECB figures. \n\n  European households don't have that much money invested in the stock market either. German households' equity holdings, as a percentage of disposable income, are five times less than for U.S. households, a working paper for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says. A 20% fall in share prices would only knock 0.1 of a percentage point off output in Germany, France, and Italy - eight times less than the effect of such a stock fall in the U.S. \n\n  \"The macroeconomic impact of movements in the stock exchanges is much more limited indeed than in the U.S.,\" Wim Duisenberg, the ECB president, said last week. \n\n  The ECB has been the only major central bank in the world not to ease borrowing costs, with growth slowing nearly everywhere. Over the past two months, however, the ECB has admitted that inflation risks are deteriorating, but some caution is necessary and justifies a wait-and-see policy. This has caused economists to expect the ECB to cut interest rates in the second quarter of this year. \n\n  Inflation reports from France, Germany and Spain earlier this week suggest annual inflation quickened in February after a two-month slowdown to perhaps as much as 2.6%, well above the 2% maximum rate the ECB permits. The European Union issues the report Friday. Oil, meat and tobacco were behind the price increases in those countries. \n\n  Unlike the U.S. and Japan, the euro-zone economy is showing only moderate signs of slowing. The ECB expects growth to slow to just under 3% this year from about 3.4% last year. \n\n  Confirming views of a slowdown, Italian industrial production in January fell a seasonally adjusted 1.8% from December, according to government report Thursday. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 16, 2001 00:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242282Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:13:51.902403Z", "inner_id": 194, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5563, "annotations": [{"id": 5500, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "zwCcZT7B2l", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T17:15:21.987010Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:15:21.987045Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 89.168, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "cf6e9671-56c5-46e8-80e9-6d24e207ddcc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5563, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Calif To OK 20% Rate Hike For Utils -Commissioners\n\n \n \n\n  (This article was originally published Saturday) \n\n \n   By Jason Leopold \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission will likely approve a 20% rate increase for two of the state's largest utilities Tuesday,  ending a three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Saturday. \n\n  The rate hike would let the state recoup money it spent buying power since January, said the commissioners, who asked not to be named. The increase also would let utilities start paying small independent power producers on a forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, the commissioners said. \n\n  PUC also may approve a trigger mechanism. The move would allow utilities PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison additional rate increases of 5%, if needed, to cover future power costs. Rates could go down if the future price of power stabilizes, the commissioners said. \n\n  A PUC administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed order that does not support the rate increase and end to the rate freeze. As a result, PUC Commission President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue an alternate proposal that will call for a rate increase of about 20%, the commissioners said. \n\n  Both proposed orders are expected to be issued Sunday afternoon. \n\n  \"There is just no way we can extract 10 cents from a nickel,\" said one Democratic commissioner, who asked not to be named. \"Unfortunately, we are going to have to grant the utilities an increase.\" \n\n \n\n  SoCal Ed To Present Rate Arguments Monday \n\n \n\n  The commission is expected to hear oral arguments Monday by SoCal Ed executives regarding the company's rate stabilization plan. When first presented to the commission in November, the plan called for a 10% rate increase. PG&E also filed a rate stabilization plan at the time asking for a similar increase. \n\n  Both utilities argued last November that their costs exceeded their revenues because wholesale power prices spiked during the summer. The utilities' customers' rates were frozen, but wholesale prices continued to soar, surpassing the roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour and 6.5 cents/KWh rate the utilities were legally allowed to charge their customers. \n\n  In December, PG&E and SoCal Ed revised their rate stabilization plan, requesting rate increases of as much as 30% because wholesale power prices failed to stabilize and the utilities were getting deeper into debt. The commission denied the request in January and approved a temporary rate increase of 9% for residential consumers and 14% for large industrial customers. \n\n  PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their ratings downgraded to junk-status by Wall Street credit agencies and have defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank loans. \n\n  Gov. Gray Davis was in Palm Springs over the weekend for a fundraiser, and his staff was unavailable for comment. Representatives for PG&E and SoCal Ed were also unavailable for comment. \n\n  Earlier this month, Davis told Wall Street analysts that he would not allow a rate increase because he feared a ballot initiative by consumer advocates in the state, who would call for an end to the state's deregulation law. \n\n  \"Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in 20 minutes,\" Davis said at a March news conference. \n\n \n\n  Group Pledges 'Ratepayer Revolt' If Prices Rise \n\n \n\n  Harvey Rosenfield, executive director of consumer advocacy group The Foundation of Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, promised a \"ratepayer revolt\" and 2002 ballot initiative if electricity rates are increased. Consumer advocates are also expected to testify at Monday's hearing about why the utilities should not be permitted to raise consumer electricity rates. \n\n  Legislative sources said the rate increase is needed so the state Department of Water Resources, which in January started purchasing power for the cash-strapped utilities, can be repaid. Moreover, the utilities can begin paying the state's so-called qualifying facilities for electricity. PG&E and SoCal Ed have not paid the QFs in full since January, and the companies owe the generators about $1 billion. \n\n  In hindsight, one key Democratic state senator said, if the state allowed the utilities to raise rates in January, the DWR would not have had to spend nearly $4 billion from the general fund buying power. Further, said the senator, who asked not to be named, the state would not have had to negotiate a deal to buy the utilities' power lines in an effort to restore the companies to financial stability. \n\n  \"Think about it. PG&E and Edison could have regained access to loans and would have been able to restore their credit,\" the senator said. \"We ultimately spent more than $5 billion than we should have if a rate increase is approved. That's not counting, the billions of dollars more we spent and are going to spend on long-term contracts, transmission assets and revenue bonds. People are going to want answers and I don't know what we're going to tell them.\" \n\n  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 26, 2001 08:15 ET (13:15 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242316Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:15:22.224142Z", "inner_id": 195, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5564, "annotations": [{"id": 5501, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "0GOXA998EM", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T17:16:35.492630Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:16:35.492655Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 72.468, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "229249c1-90ec-4cb7-8a56-26b9d4027bfc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5564, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "FERC Considers Cap On Calif Pwr Prices During Top Alerts\n\n \n \n\n  WASHINGTON (AP)--Federal energy regulators are reviewing a proposal to restrict wholesale electricity prices in California during the severe power shortages expected this summer. \n\n  The proposal, which is to be taken up at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting Wednesday, also would require producers to sell power for California's grid during power emergencies. \n\n  The commission has faced growing political pressure to find new ways to address allegations of price gouging in the Western power markets, where wholesale costs have been ten times what they were a year ago, and likely will go higher in the coming months. \n\n  The agency, reflecting the views of its Republican chairman, Curtis Hebert, has refused repeated requests by West Coast officials to impose price caps on wholesale electricity sales in the West. \n\n  The staff proposal aims to avoid the term \"price caps\" and views the plan as limited \"price mitigation\" that would seek to blunt severe price increases but not threaten supplies, according to a staff summary. \n\n  The proposal \"recognizes that (power) scarcity ... will exist for the near term and that, during such periods, some extraordinary measures must be considered,\" said the summary provided to commissioners. \n\n  It proposes that price restrictions be limited to California and only at times of so-called Stage 3 emergencies, when electricity reserve margins virtually disappear, raising the prospects of rolling blackouts. \n\n  At the same time, the commission is expected to discuss a proposal to officially endorse plans where industrial power users curtail or close facilities and sell back electricity during severe shortages. \n\n  The commission has reviewed thousands of wholesale power transactions during the first three months of this year and has singled out $124.5 million in alleged overcharges. California officials say many times that amount should be recovered in refunds because of price gouging. A recent California report put alleged overcharges during the past year at more than $6.2 billion. \n\n  The new \"price mitigation\" plan is aimed at preventing the most severe price run-ups ahead of time, instead of having to seek refunds later, according to several of the commissioners. \n\n  But the staff proposal is short of what even some members of the commission have wanted, since it limits price intervention to only the most severe emergency periods. It also does not address escalating prices elsewhere in the West, particularly Washington and Oregon, where prices at times have been higher than in California. \n\n  While Hebert, the Republican commission chairman, has stood firm in his opposition to price controls, he has indicated he might go along with some very limited form of price mitigation if it can be shown not to inhibit producers from expanding power supplies. \n\n  At the same time, Linda Breathitt, one of two Democratic commissioners, has indicated in recent weeks that she is increasingly leaning toward some price intervention. \n\n  It is \"important that we place all options on the table for serious consideration,\" including some \"price mitigation plans,\" she said during a recent FERC meeting with state utility regulators from Western states. \n\n  The third commissioner, William Massey, also a Democrat, has all along argued for across-the-board price caps, based on cost of production, and said they should apply to all 11 states in the Western power grid. \n\n  The FERC has been operating with three commissioners and two vacant seats. President Bush has announced two nominees to fill the vacancies, but both still await Senate confirmation and are not likely to be on board before the summer's power crunch hits. \n\n  When the two nominees - Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, both state utility regulators - come up for confirmation, they are expected to be questioned sharply by Senate Democrats about their views on price controls and the free market. \n\n  Last week, Democratic Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Jean Carnahan of Missouri asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether FERC has complied with its duties under the Federal Power Act to ensure that wholesale electricity prices in the West are fair and reasonable. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 23, 2001 15:55 ET (19:55 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242349Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T17:16:35.717103Z", "inner_id": 196, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5565, "annotations": [{"id": 5502, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "3hR2ZqWYcl", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T18:23:32.753969Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:23:32.753988Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 4015.969, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "b147bfb3-9b54-4693-841d-813d46e6b99d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5565, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Meat Byproduct Shortages Hit Array Of Goods In Europe\n\n \n \n\n  FRANKFURT (AP)--Fruit chews pulled from store shelves in Poland. Price hikes for Italian shoes and French handbags. Animal fat abandoned by global makers of face cream and soap. \n\n  Europe's effort to rein in its bout of livestock disease isn't just hammering world supplies of lamb chops and prime rib. It's starting to hit the 40% of a cow, pig or sheep that never makes it to a store refrigerator shelf. \n\n  Consumers around the world may soon develop a newfound appreciation for these uneaten animal parts, which are skinned, ground up or melted down into ingredients used every day in a dizzying array of goods. \n\n  With fewer animals slaughtered in Europe due to fears of eating meat, hide prices are soaring. Shoppers could pay more for this summer's lineup of items like leather furniture, high-end car seats, clothing and shoes. \n\n  Costs also are rising for tallow, or animal fat, which is used in candles, soap and beauty products - though consumer prices appear unaffected for now as manufacturers absorb higher costs or use substitute ingredients. \n\n  European suppliers of meat byproducts, meanwhile, face millions of dollars in losses. \n\n  \"Our byproduct industry has taken a hammering,\" said Martin Grantley-Smith at Britain's Meat and Livestock Commission. \"In straight exports, Britain will be losing millions of dollars a year in terms of byproducts.\" \n\n  British slaughterhouses used to get GBP5 per ton of byproduct material from companies eager to turn it into tallow, leather or bone meal. But with a host of new restrictions against using those parts, slaughterhouses are now having to pay up to GBP90.50 a ton to have it hauled away. \n\n  Bans imposed by nations around the world because of mad-cow and foot-and-mouth diseases have halted 94% of the European Union's beef exports and 73% of its pork exports. They also have slowed Europe's weekly livestock slaughter from a half million head to just 350,000 head, according to Hidenet.com, an Internet market report. \n\n  Restraints on using nonedible beef byproducts have been around since the mad-cow outbreak in the mid-1990s. But a mad-cow scare that peaked in the fall and the current food-and-mouth crisis have led countries to fortify or extend those laws. \n\n  Europe is trying to halt the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, which unlike mad-cow poses no human health threat, by incinerating the animals, hides, hooves, bones, fat and all. \n\n  Europe's mass culls have torpedoed the local supply of leather, by as much as 75% in Britain, and have lifted the price of local leather by about 20%. Worldwide, the supply squeeze has pushed up cowhide prices 15% in the last two months, Hidenet.com reported. \n\n  The market claimed its first U.S. victim last month when Irving Tanning Co., a small 390-employee firm in Hartland, Maine, filed for bankruptcy protection. \n\n  Irving Tanning doesn't buy European hides, but vice president Paul Larochelle said the company was pinched by a blitz of overseas demand for U.S. skins that pushed stateside prices up 66%. \n\n  \"You can only absorb so much before you have to turn around and say, 'Enough is enough,\"' Larochelle said. \n\n  To counteract tight demand, the European Footwear Confederation has petitioned the E.U. to order member countries to remove pelts and skins before animals are destroyed. \n\n  But what's a crisis to one region is often an opportunity to another. \n\n  Increased European demand for leather is fueling a mini-boom in Brazil, where ranchers are boosting their 2001 export forecast to 1.83 billion reals ($1=BRL2.14) from an earlier prediction of BRL1.61 billion, says Jose Roberto Scarabel, president of the Brazilian Tannery Industries Center. \n\n  U.S. hide exports shot up 25% to $2 billion last year after the mad-cow scare struck, according to Leather Industries of America, another trade group. And January exports were 12% ahead of last January's. \n\n  In other byproduct markets, the impact is less direct. \n\n  About 12% of an animal is usually ground down and melted to make tallow. The animal fat is widely used in consumer and industrial goods despite a shift to substitutes in the mid-1990s by makers of cosmetics and other products seeking to address health concerns raised in earlier mad-cow scares. \n\n  But the current outbreak has forced countries such as Japan to institute full-fledged bans against animal products in such consumer goods. \n\n  That has ramifications in Europe for companies like Cognis, a Netherlands-based chemical company that makes raw ingredients for body care products as well as industrial lubricants. \n\n  Just a few years ago, it used animal tallow in nearly half of its cosmetics. Today, virtually none of its health care line uses animal products, although tallow still accounts for 20% of its industrial chemicals. \n\n  Cognis calculates it costs 10% more to make vegetable-based products. But the shift may be paying off, because tallow prices have spiked in the last month as European restrictions crimp supplies. \n\n  \"If foot-and-mouth disease lasts for one or two years, we could see a possible increase. But right now, it's really just a short-term phenomenon,\" said Albert Strube, one of the Cognis' top chemists. \n\n  At the same time, German cosmetics giant Welle AG, maker of Ultrasheen hair care products, has tripled its research budget to find plant-based alternatives to tallow - in part because consumers scrutinize ingredients more carefully than they used to. \n\n  Gelatin, derived from ground bone and cartilage, is a common ingredient in yogurt, soft cheese, medicine capsules and jelly. It's also used in candy, which it makes soft and chewy. Recently, the German makers of the Mamba fruit chew pulled them off supermarket shelves in Poland when customs officials said they posed a possible health risk. \n\n  British candy maker Cadbury hopes to avoid a similar fate by importing its gelatin from South America, where the mad-cow risk is lower. Kurt Bohlen, general manager of Leiner Davis Gelatin, Latin America's largest gelatin producer, expects Brazilian exports to jump 10% this year. \n\n  Meanwhile, German candy giant Haribo, inventor of the gummi bear, is taking a different tact.

Sanchez \n  Dow Jones Newswires \n\n  NEW YORK -- Crude-oil futures started off the second quarter at the lowest price of the year. \n\n  May crude futures skidded 70 cents to $25.59 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. A flurry of late selling briefly sent the contract to its lowest level since May 2000. \n\n  \"There's a general oversupply of crude right now,\" said Ed Silliere, vice president of risk management at Energy Merchant, an energy-marketing firm. \"It's just the posture of the cash market. You call out for buyers, you get one or two. You call out for sellers, you get three or four.\" \n\n  The steep decline in prices was a nod to conventional wisdom: The usual seasonal decline in oil demand during the second quarter is likely to be exaggerated by the slowing economy, causing a glut and sending oil prices crashing. \n\n  Crude-oil inventories have been climbing steadily during the past three weeks and added more than 11 million barrels during the latest week reported, according to a report last week by the Department of Energy. \n\n  Yesterday's retreat in the stock market also frayed nerves over the state of the economy. \n\n  Chris Schachte of brokerage firm GSC Energy said there is a general sense of an economic slowdown: \"In that environment, demand is going to ease. \n\n  \"We're waiting to see if the stock-market problems will affect the economy,\" he said. \"There are worries that demand will fall off the table if the economy gets bad.\" \n\n  Yesterday's weak performance in crude oil sets the stage for further losses, perhaps to $24 a barrel, Mr. Schachte said. \n\n  Although refined-products futures plunged, with heating oil losing three cents and gasoline sliding two cents, it was crude oil that pressured the petroleum complex lower, analysts said. \n\n  \"This is the tail wagging the dog,\" Mr. Silliere said. \n\n  Analysts also said an article in The Wall Street Journal contributed to the pessimism with a report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries isn't likely to live up to its promises to cut output. \n\n  OPEC has cut production quotas twice this year - by 1.5 million barrels a day in January and one million barrels last month - in an effort to keep the group's reference price basket of crudes near its target of $25 a barrel. \n\n  The latest output cut went into effect Sunday. However, OPEC was overproducing by 500,000 barrels a day in February, The Wall Street Journal reported, and analysts said it won't be long before OPEC members are cheating in earnest. \n\n  The OPEC basket price slipped to $22.79 a barrel Friday. To avert a price plunge in the second quarter, OPEC members have agreed informally to reduce production quotas by an added 500,000 barrels a day if the price basket stays below $22 a barrel for 10 consecutive trading days. \n\n  \"Even if OPEC production dropped by one million barrels a day over the weekend as previously announced, the market can still be confident of a supply surplus of roughly 1.5 million barrels a day [during the second quarter],\" said Tim Evans, analyst at IFR Pegasus, a research firm. \n\n  \"It's not going to hold the price here or move it higher,\" Mr. Evans said. \n\n  In other commodity markets: \n\n \n\n  HOGS: Prices soared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, fueled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's hogs-and-pigs report. The June contract rose by its two-cent limit to 71 cents a pound. The report, released after 4 p.m. Friday, showed that at 58.8 million head, the number of hogs and pigs in the U.S. on March 1 was up 2% from last year's figures, but 1% below Dec. 1, 2000. \n\n \n\n  GOLD: Futures fell at the Comex division of Nymex on the strength of the dollar, a weakening of the lease rates charged for lending gold and reduced demand for physical gold. The June contract fell $2.60 to $256.60 a troy ounce. Dollar strength is \"taking away physical demand\" and may be encouraging selling from producers in Australia and South Africa, whose currencies are way down, said Dave Meger, senior metals analyst at Chicago-based Alaron Trading Corp. \n\n  --- \n\n  David Bogoslaw contributed to this article. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 02, 2001 19:29 ET (23:29 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242419Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:24:13.455779Z", "inner_id": 198, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5567, "annotations": [{"id": 5504, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "7yWo4WXjes", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T18:24:40.837120Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:24:40.837157Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 26.572, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "ebe9ec99-9d05-4d3a-9ddd-8c7541c1dca6", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5567, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(4/13): WEEKEND JOURNAL: Travel: Takeoffs &amp; Landings\n\n \n  By Michelle Higgins and Rafer Guzman \n\n  Mileage Marathons \n\n \n\n  HERE'S ONE corporate-travel cutback you can still salvage: your frequent-flier account. \n\n  The slowing economy is forcing business fliers to fly less or even switch to cheaper flights on carriers that don't boost their frequent-flier accounts. But travelers looking to keep upping their miles should consider so-called cash-for-clicks programs, such as FreeAirMiles.com or MyPoints.com, which reward users for purchases as well as for looking at online sites and their advertising. One site, WebMiles.com, offers fliers universal \"WebMiles\" that can be swapped for travel on any airline with no blackout dates or seat restrictions. \n\n  But that doesn't do much to help your stranded miles. \"Most online shopping and other ventures will only give you one or two miles per dollar spent,\" says frequent-flier expert Randy Petersen. \"You would have to spend a lot of money clicking and shopping.\" He says \"mileage runs,\" where travelers take a quick trip solely to accumulate miles, are becoming the best way to cure a mileage deficiency. Indeed, FlyerTalk.com has a Mileage Run forum where frequent-flier fanatics share secrets to add the most miles and other tricks of the trade. \n\n \n\n  Back to Bell \n\n \n\n  LOOKING FOR CHEAP deals on the Web? Try picking up the phone. \n\n  \"A lot of suppliers don't want to post a discounted fare where all their competitors will see it and match,\" says Sam Galeotos, president of Cheap Tickets Inc., which sometimes offers deals only through its call centers. For example, a round-trip fare from Richmond, Va., to Oakland, Calif., costs $376 via the call center, but $438 if you book online. That's 16% less. \n\n  Online discounters have long boasted that they had the cheapest deals around. While the Internet drives down prices by making it easier for consumers to shop for the best bargain, it also lets online merchants monitor and match each others' prices without overtly colluding. \n\n  Other online Web sites like Expedia and Travelocity insist their Web deals are still the lowest. \"Expedia prides itself on getting the best rates online,\" says a spokeswoman. \"The low fares are the online fares.\" \n\n \n\n  Good News \n\n  Behind the Wheel \n\n \n\n  HAS ANY PART of traveling actually gotten better? \n\n  Yes -- rental-car companies have improved their customer service and car quality, according to a new J.D. Power & Associates survey. In a poll of 2,900 customers, business travelers gave Avis and National top marks, while Enterprise ranked highest among leisure travelers. \n\n  Wait times haven't improved from last year: Business renters reported average waits of 10.5 minutes for shuttle buses and 5.5 minutes for returns. Leisure travelers waited a little longer: 11 minutes for a bus and seven minutes to return cars. But customers forgave long waits when customer service was good, says Michael Taylor, director of travel services for J.D. Power. For business customers, Avis didn't score highest in speed, but compensated by having cars at the ready with their trunks open. \n\n  On the leisure side, Enterprise led the way on both speed and service. Overall, customers were happier with the cars themselves, with only 22% reporting problems such as engine failure or unclean cars. That's down from 33% last year. \n\n  Improvements have been \"trending upward\" for the last five years, Mr. Taylor says.

Today?s payroll data added to concern over slowing growth, while a pullback of \nUS equities also added to the negative sentiment.   Similar issues also placed pressure on the industrial metals sector. \n \nGrains prices moved moderately lower today, with high stock levels continuing to cause resistance to price gains.  The ongoing dispute with China is also providing a negative backdrop given the potential for a decline in US exports to \nthis region.   Supportive elements include: poor U.S. wheat conditions, expectations for a tighter world wheat balance sheet, and wet U.S. weather forecasts which could potentially reduce total corn plantings. \n \nLivestock futures moved moderately lower despite slightly higher wholesale meat values.  Speculative long liquidation in both live cattle and lean hogs pressured prices today. Expectations for lower wholesale beef prices in the near term may have also placed pressure on live cattle prices. \n \nCoffee prices continued trending lower with high stock levels continuing to indicate that producer retention plans have failed to halt significant exports. \n \nFor more information please contact: \n \nAIG International Inc. \nAdam De Chiara - U.S.        203-861-3438 adechiara@aigtc.com \nDaniel Raab - U.S.           203-861-3438 draab@aigtc.com \nBradford L.

Bray \n \n\n  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. Mr. Bray is a staff columnist at the Detroit News. He writes a column every Tuesday for OpinionJournal.com, where this article first appeared.) \n\n \n\n  DETROIT -- It's possible, of course, that the preliminary figures showing 2% economic growth in the first quarter are just plain wrong. But out here in the industrial Midwest, some of us are wondering if this will be the recession that never happened. \n\n  While the high-tech \"new economy\" may indeed be suffering from an acute inventory overhang, the \"old economy\" appears to be adjusting rapidly -- in part thanks to inventory controls made possible by the new economy. A large backlog of unsold cars, for example, has been quickly whittled down. Vehicle production is now rising at double-digit rates. \n\n  Consumers also are showing a certain amount of exuberance. Durable-goods sales were up 3% in March, while single-home sales rose 4.8%. Pressure on profits remain intense, and highly visible layoffs are still taking place. But there are still profits to be made, and the employment picture remains relatively strong. \n\n  Maybe it's a false dawn. The stock market, perhaps the best single indicator of economic expectations, has recovered some of its losses but still bounces around uncertainly, well below its 1999-2000 highs. Classified advertising at most newspapers has fallen sharply. As higher energy prices feed through the economy -- the result mainly of a lack of generating and refining capacity -- it's hard to imagine a quick return to the florid growth of prior years. \n\n  But if the growth number holds up, it will nonetheless present the Bush administration with the best of political scenarios: a slowdown that won't seriously threaten its rising popularity but will leave the Federal Reserve chastened by the threat of deflation and Congress focused on the need for serious tax and regulatory relief. \n\n  The Democrats, eager to exploit economic fears, have launched an advertising blitz designed to show Mr. Bush as little more than a pawn of corporate interests bent on protecting obscene profits, poisoning America and jeopardizing health benefits to give huge tax cuts to the very rich. \n\n  But the mere prospect of tax and regulatory relief may have helped stabilize the economic picture somewhat by persuading Americans that the slowdown wouldn't get out of hand. \n\n  Yes, consumer confidence is down, but as The Wall Street Journal revealed Monday, a clear majority of investors now think they will earn substantial returns in the coming 12 months. Indeed, the Bush team may now be in a position to argue that the stock-market collapse and brief slowdown represented little more than a return to reality after the Clinton years. \n\n  Mr. Bush has succeeded in establishing his presidential credentials, which may have lifted a big psychological weight from the economy. Mr. Bush has made some compromises, but the Democrats have made bigger ones -- going from opposition to any tax cut to yesterday reaching tentative agreement with congressional Republicans on a $1.35 trillion deal. \n\n  In so doing, they also concede Mr. Bush is not an accidental, much less an illegitimate, president. After all, he is a man who seems to know what he is doing. The malaise of the contested election has largely passed, and with it the uncertainty that the country might find itself consumed by a political firestorm, which would make it difficult to deal with unexpected crises. \n\n  In 1993, Bill Clinton's response to a perceived slowdown was to raise taxes and invoke the need for government \"investments.\" Republicans lost some of their credibility with scare talk about how the tax increase would lead straight to economic disaster, when in fact they should have argued more prudently that the tax hike would retard recovery -- as indeed it did. \n\n  But in his first 100 days, President Bush resoundingly won the big economic argument -- that growth comes from improved incentives in the private sector, not more redistribution of income. Not even the far left is arguing for a reprise of the Clinton economic strategy. \n\n  With the economy apparently still growing, Mr. Bush can continue to move forward with his aggressive agenda. If Democrats persist in their increasingly frazzled attempts to paint Republicans as nothing more than corrupt interlopers, they risk looking just as blindly partisan as Republicans ever did. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 01, 2001 23:29 ET (03:29 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242516Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:35:35.928616Z", "inner_id": 201, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5570, "annotations": [{"id": 5507, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "aNEJAcaFpm", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T18:36:48.726299Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:36:48.726318Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 71.985, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e73a9b06-1fa6-4813-84e5-94856603e3bc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5570, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJE: WEEKEND JOURNAL: Collecting: Tracking The Art Markets: Next Stop, Basel\n\n By Margaret Studer \n\n  Some 262 galleries from Europe, the Americas and Asia will show this year around 5,000 works from 1,000 artists at Art 32 Basel ( June 13-June 18), the world's leading fair for 20th century and contemporary art. And if your body revolts at the thought of tramping around an art citadel of that mass, the fair does offer the services of a Wellness Center for the first time in its 32-year-old history. Visitors can have a massage for two Swiss francs (1.30 euros) a minute to \"recover from fair-induced physical stress,\" notes the fair's arm-breaking 652-page catalogue. And paying tribute to the growing number of young collectors, the fair also has installed for the first time a kindergarten, thus relieving parents for an undisturbed art hunt in the jungle of stands. This younger group has become increasingly important as \"involvement with cultural assets enjoys a rising popularity,\" says Dresdner Bank art analyst Wolfgang Wilke in the bank's latest issue of \"Trends.\" What's more, there is a new gourmet restaurant in the VIP collectors' club manned by the city's star chefs: Pierre Buess of Restaurant Bruderholz (2 Michelin stars) and Evelyne and Werner Martin of Restaurant Martin in Flueh (1 Michelin star). Indeed, there's nothing like a good lunch to open a collector's wallet. \n\n  For six days each year, this Swiss town on the Rhine, becomes the commercial center of the global contemporary and modern art world. \"No other fair comes close to Basel. Dealers actually keep back works for the Basel fair,\" says Cheyenne Westphal, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's Europe. From the around 900 galleries that apply, only a third are chosen by the fair's selection committee. And they are a careful mix of galleries offering classical modern pieces that are priced in the millions of dollars and young art that is sold for a few thousand dollars or less. In this year's vast so-called \"Art Unlimited\" hall will be the trendy young Atelier van Lieshout's compost toilet in the form of  a fisherman's house, offered by Amsterdam's Galerie Fons Welters, for around $20,000 (23,100 euros) or the equally trendy team of Markus Muntean and Adi Rosenblum with \"Untitled\" (2000), an installation with two lost figures standing uncertainly beside a large bed priced at around $30,000 at Galerie Susanna Kulli in St. Gallen. \n\n  Coming after last week's round of benchmark contemporary-art auctions in New York but before London's big contemporary-art sales in the last week of June, the fair is the next major sales event on the art circuit. And whereas auction results are what reveal the state of the market for most of the year, Basel is the galleries' showcase where they become the barometer of the market's health. Among the trends illustrated at the New York sales is a growing interest in cutting edge, figurative art such as portraits by Karen Kilimnik and John Currin. In New York last week, a standing nude portrait of a woman by Currin was estimated by Christie's at up to $200,000 and went for $336,000. There's also a return to craftsmanship through painting, drawing and watercolors, says Sotheby's Ms. Westphal. And while the prices of stars such as Jeff Koons are nearing those of Andy Warhol, buying is very selective, she adds. For example, at Sotheby's last week Koons's \"Michael Jackson and Bubbles\" (1988) sold for a record $5.6 million, but at Phillips auction Koons's stainless-steel flower sculpture failed to sell. Demand for photo art continues, led by stars including Cindy Sherman, Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth, notes Ms. Westphal. At Christie's in New York, a work by Gursky \"N.Y. Mercantile Exchange\" (2000) was estimated at up to $180,000 and sold for $292,000. But on the other hand there were works by Gursky at last week's auctions that didn't sell. \n\n  A look through the Basel fair's catalogue shows all these trends and more. \"It will be a real mix with a lot of photography,\" says Mr. Vetsch. \n\n \n\n  Chelsea Fair \n\n \n\n  Although ArtLondon founder Ralph Ward-Jackson admits that his event with 50 exhibitors of 20th century and contemporary art is modest in comparison with Basel, he asserts the event is hard to beat for charm. The London fair takes place between June 6 and June 10 in an outdoor marquee on the King's Road, with lots of champagne on tap. Mr. Ward-Jackson encourages one-man shows. \"You tend to go gaga in Basel with all those artists. I have to take a rest,\" he says. To be included in this year's one-man shows is one devoted to British artist L.S. Lowry at the John Martin Gallery. In the same week, Christie's will auction nine Lowry paintings from the Frederick Forsyth collection at King Street on June 8. The paintings are expected to fetch a total of more than GBP 1 million (1,648,396 euros). \n\n  Prices generally range between GBP 500 and GBP 500,000. Although the fair's strongest contingent is British with top names such as Terry Frost, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, Graham Sutherland, Christopher Wood, Roger Hilton and Ivon Hitchens, collectors can also pick up top non-U.K. artists. The Coskun Fine Art Gallery will offer Andy Warhol's \"Playboy Bunnie\" (1985) for $55,000. And there will be a strong representation of Asian art. \"On the contemporary front, Asian art seems to be very strong in London at the moment,\" says Mr. Ward-Jackson. Asia Contemporary Art will offer political pop artist Wang Guang Yi's painting entitled \"Great Criticism - Elle\" (1997) for GBP 15,000. \n\n  Nevertheless, in a British election week, attention is likely to go to a set of 15 papier-mache dogs decorated in the currency of the 15 members of the European Union by Britain's Justine Smith. The Rebecca Hossack Gallery will ask GBP 1,000 per dog plus the face value of the notes on the dog's surface. \n\n  --- \n\n                     Auction Diary \n \n  - May 25 - Fine silver and jewelry sale at Phillips, Edinburgh. www.phillips-auctions.com \n  - May 25 - Garden statuary at Sotheby's South. \n  - May 30 - Medieval Art at Etude Tajan, Paris. www.tajan.com \n  - May 30 - Modern and Contemporary art including major paintings by Lucio Fontana at Sotheby's, Milan. \n  - May 30 - 31 - Important jewels, watches and clocks at Christie's, Milan. www.christies.com \n  - May 30 - 31 - Latin American art with major works by Pedro Figari and David Alfaro Siqueiros at Christie's, New York. \n  - May 31 - June 1 - Latin American art with major works by Frida Kahlo, Rufino Tamayo and Roberto Matta at Sotheby's, New York \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 25, 2001 00:31 ET (04:31 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242551Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:36:49.029893Z", "inner_id": 202, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5571, "annotations": [{"id": 5508, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "z-h9CJ51zO", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T18:38:41.824188Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:38:41.824222Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 111.84, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f9ced367-4bef-401b-8fbd-61f2b7e7cd7a", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5571, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Overnight Market Commentary\n\n \nGLOBAL STOCK INDEXES at 18:15 EDT/2215 GMT \n                         Latest     Change   %Change    %12/31 \nNew York   DJ Indus     11005.37   -117.05     -1.05     +2.03    May 25 \n           Nasdaq        2251.03    -30.99     -1.36     -8.88    May 25 \n           S&P 500       1277.89    -15.28     -1.18     -3.21    May 25 \nToronto    TSE 300       8292.84    -53.97     -0.65     -7.17    May 25 \nLondon     FTSE 100      5889.80    -26.10     -0.44     -5.35    May 25 \n           FTSE 250      6612.00    -23.80     -0.36     +0.99    May 25 \nFrankfurt  Xetra DAX     6223.57    -55.33     -0.88     -3.26    May 25 \nParis      CAC40         5581.94    -74.53     -1.32     -5.81    May 25 \nTokyo      Nikkei 225   13765.92   -129.87     -0.93     -0.14    May 25 \n           Nikkei 300     272.41     -1.29     -0.47     +3.58    May 25 \nHong Kong  Hang Seng    13753.99    -56.61     -0.41     -8.89    May 25 \nSydney     All Ords      3361.70      Unch      Unch     +6.56    Intraday \n \n \nNEW YORK STOCKS: \n \n\n  Major market averages stumbled in thin trading Friday, after government data released Friday renewed concerns about the pace of the economy's recovery. \n\n  Shares of several home builders struggled in the session with Pulte declining US$2.07 to US$40.09, while Centex lost 69 cents to 37.78, and Toll Brothers retreated 1.02 to 30.97. \n\n  The decline followed a Commerce Department report that showed existing home sales fell more sharply than economists had anticipated, which itself trailed a surprisingly weak new home sales report Thursday. \n\n  Other data released Friday, including a look at durable goods orders last month and a revision to the estimate of gross domestic product last quarter, also showed weaker-than-expected conditions in the economy, suggesting that the economy's response to the recent cycle of interest-rate reductions has been sluggish. \n\n  Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a speech in New York late Thursday, indicated that the economy's slowdown hasn't abated, which would suggest more rate hikes would be in the offing, something that, had the data Friday been more favorable, might have been taken a bit more constructively. \n\n  \"Fed Chairman Greenspan's speech last night signaled more easing ahead,\" Maury Harris, an economist at UBS Warburg, said in a report Friday, \"but didn't answer 'how much more?' or 'when?\"' \n\n  Shares of capital-goods makers, which tend to weaken in response to sluggish economic conditions, declined, with United Technologies off 98 cents to 83.25, while Boeing lost 1.87 to 63.33. \n\n  Retailers also faded on concerns that consumer spending, which has been weak, won't tick up until the economy begins to flourish again. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.69 to 51.20, while Home Depot fell 1.17 to 52.28. \n\n  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 117.05 points lower, a decline of 1.05%, to 11005.37. The Nasdaq Composite fell 31.01, or 1.35%, to close at 2251.01. \n\n  Some market watchers argued that the economic data, and Greenspan's speech, which, at least arguably holds the promise of more stock-friendly rate cuts, had less to do with the outcome of Friday's trading than did the casual nature of pre-holiday trading, especially given the market's big gains coming into the session. \n\n  Share volume fell markedly, with 818 million shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 1.1 billion Thursday, which itself wasn't an especially busy session. \n\n  \"As we ease into this holiday weekend, the stock market is acting very normal,\" Don Hays, of Hays Research, said in a report Friday. \"Stocks that broke out of consolidation or bottoming formations have been spending the last couple of days consolidating back to those break-out patterns.\" \n\n  On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,389 issues advancing, 1,637 declining and 218 unchanged. \n\n  NYSE volume totaled 816,082,120 shares, compared with 1,098,168,430 Thursday. \n\n  The NYSE Composite Index was 647.13, down 5.85. The average price per share fell 35 cents. \n\n \n \nNEW YORK PRECIOUS METALS: \n \n\n  Precious metals were trading mixed late Friday, with gold futures giving back another chunk of their gains on long liquidation by funds and other speculative players, yet bouncing back from lows, participants said. \n\n  \"It was long liquidation, end of week. A lot of people have had decent P&L (profit and loss),\" said a bullion dealer at a major investment bank in New York. \"Open interest is still up, so the funds are not completely out of their (long) positions.\" \n\n   (Prices in Dollars per Troy Ounce) \n       Friday      Chng On     Leading         Nymex \n       1515 ET     Late NY     Nymex           Range \nGold   277.70      -1.55       278.20  (Jun)   275.50-281.70 \nSilver   4.58      -0.035        4.583 (Jul)     4.555-4.62 \nPlat   616.00      +2.00       622.00  (Jul)   618.00-625.00 \nPall   660.00      +5.00       660.00  (Jun)   659.00-665.00 \n\n  Open interest in the June contract fell by 10,132 contracts on Thursday, while August open interest swelled by 13,671 contracts. \n\n  \"The only thing I read into it was the rollover, which isn't a surprise. That's going to be normal,\" said Dave Meger, senior metals analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. \"I assume they're longs in the market rolling. The shorts are under no pressure to do so.\" \n\n  June gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange finished trading US$1.20 lower at US$278.20 a troy ounce. \n\n  He cited an abundance of fund selling Friday, but emphasized that people had been looking too hard for reasons behind the collapse of the rally, when funds are motivated mainly by technical considerations. \n\n  \"You get weak longs buying up near US$290 (an ounce) and you (drop to) US$280, you're going to see long liquidation. There's no big reason behind it,\" he explained. \n\n  Everyone was now focusing on the US$275 level, which he imagined would be taken out if only because sell-stops were accumulating under there and they were likely to be targeted next week. \n\n  The bulls still might have a chance at extending the rallying back up again if they managed to wash out the weak longs and prepare to advance again, he noted. \n\n  While it was clear to him that the absence of producer selling due to reduced returns for selling forward had been a key factor in the rally, he doubted the market coud count on them remaining sidelined for a prolonged time span. \n\n  The bullion dealer predicted more volatility next week, potentially leading to prices covering much the same range seen this week. He said a US$5 move to either side of the curent price was probable. \n\n  Comex July silver fell back, ending 3.7 cents lower at US$4.583 an ounce, after testing and failing again at the 200-day moving average of US$4.62 an ounce. \n\n  The 5.0% drop in durable goods orders for April, released Friday morning, hurt silver because it boded badly for industrial demand, the bullion dealer said. \n\n  Silver hasn't been as vulnerable as gold to liquidation of speculative long positions, said Alaron's Meger, but he had little confidence it could sustain itself above US$4.55 support or even the earlier high of US$4.515 an ounce. It was stil trading on the back of gold, he added. \n\n  Commission house buying pushed Nymex July platinum into buy-stop territory above US$623, a floor trader said, but the market came off to finish at US$622, up US$3 from Thursday. While he saw the gains as likely to attract more buying from funds, they are already quite long. \n\n  June palladium rose US$5.00 to US$660 an ounce, looking stronger and possibly preparing to head back toward US$680-$700 after the long holiday weekend, another trader said. \n\n \n \nNYMEX: \n \n\n  Refined products futures retreated Friday at the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders locked in profits ahead of Memorial Day weekend, but rose from the day's lows at the close. \n\n  Crude futures closed as they had opened, trading on either side of unchanged. \n\n  Nymex closed at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) Friday, and will be closed Monday for Memorial Day. \n\n  The decline in refined products contracts extended a sell-off that was sparked by gasoline futures Thursday. The sell-off came after what traders called \"panicked\" short covering Wednesday exhausted itself early Thursday, ending a sizzling rally in which futures rose 17% in a week. \n\n  \"That took the pressure out of the market,\" a floor trader said. \"We had a good move Thursday. We aren't getting much of a bounce. That sets the tone for the next two sessions.\" \n\n  Crude futures could lose US$1 next week, traders said, barring refinery problems and other fundamentally bullish news. \n\n  Crude is being driven by declining gasoline futures and pressured by its own weak technicals and the weight of continued builds in crude stockpiles on surging imports. The nearby July crude oil contract has fallen US$2.50 from its high Wednesday. \n\n  Nearby gasoline futures trimmed most losses on short covering and bargain hunting at the close. June gasoline futures are 6 cents off their high from Thursday: an all-time record of US$1.1750 a gallon. The contract is seen expiring May 31 near US$1.065. Deferred gasoline contracts retreated sharply. \n\n  Booksquaring ahead of Memorial Day was the dominant feature of trading Friday. Volume was thin and many players were absent. \n\n  Concerns over thin supplies and regional shortages just ahead of the traditional Memorial Day kickoff to the summer driving season, coupled with refinery problems and a drop in reformulated summer gasoline stocks, may continue to support the petroleum complex. Tightness in the supply situation is making traders wary of aggressively selling the market short. \n\n  \"One refinery glitch and prices could pop 4 cents,\" an analyst said. \"Especially over a long holiday weekend.\" \n\n  A draw in key summertime inventories triggered the latest leg up. Stocks of reformulated gasoline fell 1.4 million barrels to 39.9 million barrels in the week ended May 18, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. That substantiated an earlier report by the American Petroleum Institute. \n\n  Last year, stocks were 42 million barrels. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 27, 2001 18:35 ET (22:35 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242601Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:38:42.053509Z", "inner_id": 203, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5572, "annotations": [{"id": 5509, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "r3PbmYZ8Xw", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T18:39:44.200523Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:39:44.200548Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 61.37, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "625c6946-9e56-4a75-ab8f-37830364cdd0", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5572, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Survey: Teachers&apos; Salaries Don&apos;t Keep Pace With Inflation\n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON (AP)--Teacher salaries have risen slightly in the past several years, but have failed to keep up with inflation, according to surveys released Thursday by teachers' unions. \n\n  The American Federation of Teachers said the average teacher salary in the 1999-2000 school year was $41,820, up 3.2% from the previous year but just short of the 3.4 inflation rate. AFT said the rise in salary was among the smallest in 40 years. \n\n  \"The teacher shortage plaguing school districts nationwide will not abate unless salaries improve,\" AFT President Sandra Feldman said. \"Better wages aren't the only way to retain and recruit teachers, but they sure make a difference.\" \n\n  The National Education Association's survey found that, adjusting for inflation, teacher salaries in half of the states dropped in the last decade. \n\n  The NEA said teachers in West Virginia, Arkansas and Alabama saw the largest drops in real earnings, from 12 to 16%, since 1989. \n\n  The surveys used data from state departments of education. The unions had slightly different calculations on state-by-state salaries, but both said Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania paid teachers the most, between $48,300 and $52,400 on average. \n\n  Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota were at the bottom of both lists, paying teachers, on average, about $30,000. South Dakota, at $29,072, paid the lowest average teacher salary in both lists. \n\n  AFT said the average salary increase for new teachers was actually lower in 1999 than in 1998. New teachers last year earned, on average, $27,989, up 4.2% from the previous year. In 1998, their salaries jumped 4.4%, AFT said. \n\n  The NEA report said that, between 1989 and 2000, average salaries rose by less than 1%, adjusted for inflation. It also said spending on K-12 education increased but didn't keep pace with the nation's economic growth. \n\n  While education revenue per student increased 3.6% from the 1998 to 1999, NEA said, total personal income in the United States grew 5.9%. \n\n  \"It's inexcusable that during a decade of unprecedented economic growth in this country, students were left behind. What does that say about the real value we place on education?\" said NEA President Bob Chase. \n\n  New teachers' salaries also lost ground to starting wages in other white-collar professions, the NEA said. \n\n  While a new teacher could expect to earn about $27,989, college graduates could expect an average starting salary of $47,112 for engineering jobs, $46,495 for computer science jobs and $40,242 for jobs in business. \n\n  \"I don't think there's anybody who doesn't wish teachers could be paid more, said Bruce Hunter, director of public policy for the American Association of School Administrators. \"It really gets down to, 'Can you?\"' \n\n  Hunter said many states are watching good teachers leave for states that pay higher salaries. \n\n  \"In some places the taxpayers have been very generous, and in some places they haven't,\" he said. \n\n  On the Net: \n\n  NEA: http://www.nea.org \n\n  AFT: http://www.aft.org \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 16, 2001 23:59 ET (03:59 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242633Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:39:44.414252Z", "inner_id": 204, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5573, "annotations": [{"id": 5510, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "yQ2Gy8C_8v", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T18:40:35.465488Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:40:35.465513Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 50.271, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "37c4d84c-6c88-4cd9-9933-b8e4c9d0c9ce", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5573, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(5/30): Brazil Proposal To Boost Thermal Power Comes Late\n\n By Jonathan Karp \n  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The government is poised to remove a key obstacle to the construction of thermoelectric-power plants in a move that foreign investors said is welcome but two years too late to avert the country's energy crisis. \n\n  Brazil urgently needs thermal power to reduce its almost-exclusive dependence on hydroelectricity. But many foreign investors have balked because of the high foreign-exchange risk involved in paying dollars for natural gas, used to fuel the plants, but being able to sell the electricity at prices set in Brazil's currency. Under a new plan, the government will set natural-gas prices annually and state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, which will supply most of the gas, will absorb foreign-exchange variations. \n\n  \"This is one step forward. Gas is 50% of a power plant's cost,\" said Luiz David Travesso, head of AES Corp.'s Brazil unit. The Arlington, Va., utility, one of the largest U.S. investors in Brazil, suspended $2 billion in planned power projects earlier this month in a warning to the government to clarify investment and regulatory rules. \n\n  Mr. Travesso said it is too early to resume talks over the plants because there are other issues to be resolved, such as long-term financing and provisions for electricity distributors to raise consumer rates in line with rising energy prices. \n\n  Drought and rising demand have drained Brazil's reservoirs. The country is to begin rationing energy this week in an attempt to reduce consumption by 20% and prevent blackouts. The crisis has revived efforts to accelerate the construction of power plants fired by plentiful natural gas from Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina. \n\n  A two-year-old government plan envisioned 49 new thermal-power plants, but just nine are under construction, said Paulo Feldmann, head of Ernst & Young's energy practice in Sao Paulo. \"It's a pity. If the government had resolved the gas issue a year-and-a-half ago, these thermal plants would be operating,\" he said. \n\n  The new natural-gas scheme won't satisfy all 49 planned projects, because Petrobras managed to cap its supply so as to reduce its financial exposure. \n\n  Separately, the Brazilian unit of Canada's Alcan Inc. said it is preparing to cut aluminum production in the next six months by almost 25% because of power rationing. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 29, 2001 19:54 ET (23:54 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242662Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T18:40:35.686311Z", "inner_id": 205, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5574, "annotations": [{"id": 5511, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "F-VhRNF6go", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:07:20.814537Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:07:20.814555Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 1604.345, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5cab0cc0-f310-4711-87de-a352fd6df21c", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5574, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(6/29): Column: Argentina&apos;s Econ Measures Are Pro-Growth\n\n \n  By Domingo F. Cavallo \n \n\n  (Editor's Note: Mr. Cavallo is Argentina's economy minister.) \n\n \n\n  Two weeks ago the Argentine government launched a new package of measures aimed at improving fiscal solvency, enhancing competitiveness, and reigniting domestic demand and economic growth. \n\n  No economic recovery can take place without an improvement in Argentina's macroeconomic fundamentals. This is why our earlier policy changes, announced over the past couple of months, have focused on this objective. New tax measures and cuts in public spending were designed to consolidate fiscal matters. A successful debt exchange, carried out last month, will create a substantial reduction in financing needs over the next five years. Competitiveness plans focus on reducing tax pressure on domestic producers so as to encourage investment, employment and growth. \n\n  Now we have moved to strengthen these policies. On the fiscal side we are declaring an all-out war against tax evasion and privatizing the collection of tax arrears. In terms of competitiveness, we are moving to protect domestic producers from adverse external shocks and boosting domestic demand through additional measures aimed at encouraging consumption and investment. \n\n  This government is committed to building a tax system with only two taxes: the value-added tax (VAT) and the income tax. This new tax system will require mechanisms to reduce the current levels of tax evasion. To tackle these objectives the government is establishing a uniform payroll tax of 16%. If this new rate increases an individual's tax burden, the difference may be credited toward his or her VAT. Only those who were previously evading income tax will pay more. We are also changing the VAT payment regime to a cash basis -- from an accrual basis -- in order in order to facilitate taxpayers' financial management and also compliance control. \n\n  The new measures also include the implementation of a privately managed system to collect tax arrears. The private manager will establish a trust fund, which will be made up of unpaid taxes as its assets and tax credits owed as its liabilities. The liabilities will be securitized as bonds and given to corporations that are due the credits. This will convert tax credits, previously immobilized on balance sheets, into liquid instruments. It is expected that a private manager will collect tax arrears more efficiently than the government. And collection improvements will reduce the incentive for tax evasion. \n\n  To enhance competitiveness and encourage exports the government is implementing a comprehensive set of trade-policy instruments that we call the \"convergence factor.\" Exports will be rewarded with an adjustable reimbursement equal to the difference between the present exchange rate -- one U.S. dollar -- and the rate under the enhanced convertibility law, which is a simple average of the dollar and the euro. At the present time that difference is approximately 7 cents. \n\n  Similarly, imports will pay a tariff, also adjustable, and of the same magnitude. In order to compensate for the short-run price effects associated with the convergence factor, the maximum import tariff on consumer goods and the maximum reimbursement on exports are reduced 7 percentage points. \n\n  It is worth noting that the new mechanism has nothing to do with old-fashioned dual exchange-rate regimes. It preserves dollar convertibility in its present form for peso holders, fully respecting their property rights, and does not imply a modification of the exchange system of the Argentine peso. The payments will be done through current trade-policy practices with no participation whatsoever of the Central Bank or monetary authorities, which will continue to exchange one peso for one dollar as required by the convertibility law. Reserves of the Central Bank play no role in the scheme, which in no way is related to currency transactions. \n\n  The convergence factor fluctuates on the basis of the dollar-euro exchange rate and, to the extent that these currencies approach parity, it would converge to zero. When dollar-euro parity is reached, the new dollar-euro method of valuing the peso will take effect, and therefore the need for the convergence factor will disappear. \n\n  The new mechanism also generates resources for the government. Since fuels will be excluded, and our trade has a significant surplus in this area, income will be larger than payments. The elimination of reimbursements adds to the fiscal savings of the measure. In all the government expects to collect almost $600 million from these trade-related measures. \n\n  The strengthened competitiveness of the tradable sector is a key element for sustaining long-run economic growth. However, the government recognizes that an economic recovery requires domestic demand. In order to boost domestic demand (consumption and investment) the government has designed two measures. First, to underpin recovery of domestic consumption, we have implemented an income-tax cut for families with medium and low incomes. The cut increases disposable income by about $500 million. Second, to strengthen the infrastructure plan, and to enhance its execution capacity, a Road Network Fund will be created, financed by a modification of the toll system and fuel taxes. The fuel-tax adjustment will sharply reduce gasoline prices, putting another $500 million in consumers' pockets. This will be financed by an increase in diesel taxes that can be counted as prepayment against the VAT. \n\n  The fiscal impact of these measures is estimated to be above $600 million, yet improving fiscal balance is not the main purpose of the latest policy changes. The focus is improving competitiveness and reducing tax evasion, thus increasing fairness and making it possible to lower rates for everyone. \n\n  In this sense, we address not only social concerns but also market concerns: to improve the fight against tax evasion, to consolidate fiscal resources, and to shield the economy from additional appreciation of the dollar. This completes our short-run economic policy measures, which were made in installments because of the constraints produced by the need for congressional approval of specific legislation. \n\n  We will now move to long-run structural measures such as social-security reform, the improvement of the health-care system, and even stronger trade liberalization. Friday's decision to set up a single trade negotiator for Mercosur is a good starting point. This negotiator will be given the task of working to open the markets of the European Union and the U.S. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 28, 2001 23:59 ET (03:59 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242696Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:07:21.041086Z", "inner_id": 206, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5575, "annotations": [{"id": 5512, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "5Y7K-m_y2q", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:05.195822Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:05.195857Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:04.145726Z", "lead_time": 103.45, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "4bc358a9-7234-49c4-99b3-e192f577d29d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5575, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(6/25): US Faces Fight For &quot;Smart&quot; Sanctions Against Iraq\n\n \n  By Neil King Jr. and Bhushan Bahree \n  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  WASHINGTON -- Bush administration officials enter a week of tough diplomacy at the United Nations today on fears that international opposition could thwart efforts to build a new \"smart\" sanctions system for Iraq. \n\n  Facing deep resistance among Iraq's neighbors and its allies Russia and China, the U.S. and Britain say they will continue to push for a Security Council vote on a new Iraq resolution before a July 3 deadline. But senior U.S. officials concede that many forces are stacked against them and that a vote is likely to be put off for a month or longer - and could be scrapped altogether. \n\n  Iraq hasn't exported any oil under the U.N. oil-for-food program for three weeks in protest over the sanctions initiative, depriving the world market of an average flow of about 2.1 million barrels a day. Further delays at the U.N. could keep that oil off the market for months, although Baghdad's punitive move has so far done little to affect prices or squeeze supplies. \n\n  Defeat at the U.N. would be a sharp blow to Secretary of State Colin Powell, who plunged into Iraq diplomacy in his first weeks in office in a bid to rebuild an international consensus to contain Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Failure would also leave the current sanctions system in a shambles and give weight to those within the administration who favor launching a U.S.-backed armed insurgency to topple the Iraqi government. \n\n  The U.S. and British plan, now into its third draft resolution, aims to allow a free flow of goods into Iraq except for a core list of items whose import would need U.N. approval. The administration also has promised to find ways to crack down on the import of illegal military goods into Iraq and to cut off the smuggling of Iraqi oil, an effort that has largely run aground due to opposition among neighboring states like Jordan and Syria. \n\n  Much of the diplomatic skirmishing still swirls around a list of dual-use items that would require U.N. approval before Iraq could buy them. Russia and China want a much leaner list to allow Iraq easy access to telecommunications and other equipment that they argue pose no military threat. \n\n  France and Russia, who like Security Council member China can veto any resolution, also want to open the way for some foreign investment, particularly in Iraq's decrepit oil industry. The U.S. says it will oppose any provision that could end up enriching Saddam Hussein. \n\n  U.S. officials admit they underestimated the difficulty of squeezing so many clashing interests and proposals into a three- or four-page resolution that would then win the support of all 15 Security Council members. But other developments have gone against them since the effort began. The fighting between Palestinians and Israelis got bloodier, spreading anger through the Arab world. And Iraqi threats to cut off the flow of cheap oil to its neighbors made countries like Jordan and Syria less than keen to sign onto a new sanctions system. \n\n  U.S. officials, though, say their largest obstacle now is Russia. Moscow would prefer to get rid of the 11-year-old sanctions on Iraq altogether and views the latest round of U.S. diplomacy as little more than a stalling tactic. Still, one U.S. official said the administration still hopes to win Russia over, though it remains unclear what concessions the U.S. might offer to get Moscow's support. \n\n  Russia successfully pushed for an open debate on Iraq within the Security Council for tomorrow afternoon in what many predict could be a lively session. U.S. diplomats have criticized the debate as a time-consuming distraction, but say they hope to use the forum to sway skeptics. \n\n  On the oil side, the market has largely been calmed by repeated pledges from Saudi Arabia that the kingdom will raise output if the loss of crude from Iraq begins to squeeze the world market. The Saudis have said they would boost exports if necessary in a coordinated move with others in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC's ministers have called a ministerial meeting for July 3 in Vienna, less than a month after they last met following the Iraqi shutdown and decided to hold output steady. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 24, 2001 19:30 ET (23:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242728Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:05.425670Z", "inner_id": 207, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5576, "annotations": [{"id": 5513, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "THH0NGrfGI", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:26.567736Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:26.567763Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:19.925337Z", "lead_time": 20.451, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "95671643-d82f-48b7-9819-774196f151b2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5576, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DATA SNAP: Brazil Inflation Slows On Easing Food Prices\n\n \n \nIPCA Consumer Price Index: \n              May       Apr      Mar      Feb      Jan \nForecast     +0.41%   +0.55%   +0.36%   +0.29%   +0.48% \nActual       +0.41%   +0.58%   +0.38%   +0.46%   +0.57% \n \n    By Anthony Dovkants \n    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Meeting market expectations, Brazil's key consumer price index slowed in May thanks to an easing in food inflation. \n\n  But the deceleration was partly offset by a pickup in transportation costs. \n\n  The government-run IBGE statistics institute Tuesday said the IPCA Broad Consumer Price Index advanced 0.41% in May, compared with a 0.58% increase in April. \n\n  According to a Dow Jones Newswires' survey of 15 economists, the average forecast pointed to a 0.41% rise in the IPCA Broad Consumer Price Index in May. Projections ranged from increases of between 0.21% to 0.45%. \n\n  The May figure put the 12-month inflation rate at 7.04% and the year-to-date increase at 2.42%. \n\n  The easing in food price inflation is on the back of the arrival of crops on the market following harvest, combined with a drop in beef prices on the market following a series of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the southern prime cattle-raising state of Rio Grande do Sul. \n\n  IBGE said food prices in May rose 0.58%, compared with an increase of 1.80% in April. The turnaround in food price inflation comes after months of pressure from the category on the overall index. \n\n  The slowdown in the May rate, though, was partly offset by the city of Sao Paulo boosting bus fares by 22% last month, the IBGE said. \n\n  Despite the easing in the pace of inflation, the matter continues to be a big concern as Latin America's biggest nation now deals with a six-month electricity rationing plan that is likely to cut into economic growth and push prices higher. The rationing program, which started June 1, requires industry, commerce and retail users to cut electricity use by an average 20% a month. \n\n  The slowdown in May comes ahead of electricity distributors raising fees between June and July and that this factor, combined with high international oil prices and the sharp depreciation of the local currency, is expected to drive inflation higher in coming months. The weak real, which has lost some 19% of its value since the start of the year, so far has mainly affected prices on the wholesale level. \n\n  The falling currency is also making Brazilian oil imports more expensive and the energy crunch could also send housing costs higher, as the government plans to levy a surcharge on those consumers that fail to meet their energy-saving targets. \n\n  Opinion is divided among analysts over whether the central bank, which has a 4% IPCA target for this year, will further hike interest rates to keep inflation in check. The goal has a two-percentage-point leeway either side and central bank governor Arminio Fraga recently said inflation could reach 5.5% this year. \n\n  While some advocate more hikes as inflation remains a threat, others believe that more monetary tightening this year would be useless as the moves would only affect 2002 prices. Inflationary concerns led the central bank to raise the country's benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 16.75% between March and May. That reversed a two-year policy of monetary easing. \n\n  The hikes and the energy crisis are expected to shave between one to two percentage points of the initially forecast 4% to 4.5% growth rate for 2001, while also slowing growth next year. \n\n \n\n  -By Anthony Dovkants, Dow Jones Newswires; 55-11 3145-1478; anthony.dovkants@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 12, 2001 09:03 ET (13:03 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242761Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:09:26.791300Z", "inner_id": 208, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5577, "annotations": [{"id": 5514, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "7Baj2vlHtf", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:10:37.331630Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:10:37.331656Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 69.716, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d8dd26da-55e8-4c2d-8c60-bf27ed59ee3e", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5577, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "BoE Watch: Growing Imbalances May Cause Econ To Wobble\n\n \n \n   By Gonzalo Vina \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n  (This story was originally published Friday) \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The Bank of England are becoming increasingly concerned that different parts of the British economy are moving at varying speeds. \n\n  As trade figures indicated only too clearly earlier this week, exports are being hurt by the strength of the pound and the global economic downturn while imports are soaring to meet the insatiable appetites of British consumers. \n\n  The central bank has also been confronted with trying to insulate the U.K. from the effects of a global economic downturn by cutting interest rates, at a time when the housing market, retail sales and consumer borrowing could do with the opposite. \n\n  And if that weren't enough, the big public spending increases pledged by the government will pump extra money into the economy over the next few years. \n\n  During his annual Mansion House speech, the governor of the Bank of England Eddie George, warned that these imbalances can't go on forever and the \"elastic is likely to break - possibly through an exchange rate adjustment\". \n\n  And having recently deliberately stimulated domestic demand to offset the effects of the global downturn, that demand will have to be reined back, even though the momentum could prove hard to stop, he added. \n\n  While the governor also said that this moment is not yet here, it explains the rate stetting Monetary Policy Committee's reluctance to drop rates more sharply in recent months. \n\n  For Danny Gabay, an economist at JP Morgan in London, George's comments are a clear signal that interest rates will stay on hold at 5.75%. \n\n  \"His (George's) key theme was the twin-speed economy: external weakness and domestic strength - the latter partly deliberately engineered by the MPC to offset the former. However, in an emphatic statement of rates on hold, he noted that this policy could do little to offset external weakness, but ran the risk of exacerbating the growing imbalances within the economy,\" said Gabay. \n\n  The central bank's deputy governor also did much to highlight these imbalances during a lecture in Cardiff and, while mentioning that he was keeping an eye on creeping inflation, he did much to play down any worries attributing the recent rises to seasonal food and gasoline price rises. \n\n  The central bank is in tight spot. It faces rising inflation and an overactive consumer sector which it can do little to curb because of uncertainty still surrounding the U.S. and now euro-zone economies. \n\n  Furthermore, the political necessities of the current government could also make these imbalances worsen. The Labour Party was voted in for a second term with what Prime Minister Tony Blair regards as a clear mandate to improve public services above all. \n\n  Geoffrey Dicks, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland believes that government spending pledges will add fuel to an already roaring fire. \n\n  He looks back to 1987, the last time a Chancellor loosened the country's' purse strings at a time when consumer demand was strong. \n\n  \"The parallels with 1987, when a reelected government found itself having to deliver on election promises, will worry those on the MPC with long memories,\" he said. \n\n  Dicks notes how the Conservative Chancellor of the day, Nigel Lawson, was reelected on the promise of further tax cuts.

The oil sector makes up about 40% of total GDP. \n\n  Other parts of the economy are expected to achieve good growth this year on the back of healthy oil prices. \n\n  The Saudi government owns around 70% of the domestic petrochemical industry, the largest in the Middle East. The construction sector, whose performance has traditionally tracked the price of oil, has shown consistent growth since the third quarter of last year. \n\n \n\n  By Abdulla Fardan, Dow Jones Newswires; (973) 530758; abdullah.fardan@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 18, 2001 09:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242826Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:11:52.609867Z", "inner_id": 210, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5579, "annotations": [{"id": 5516, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "hKAMLWM5-t", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:13:03.871625Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:13:03.871661Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 70.486, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "60785e41-e0d4-4d1b-abd4-42e743d5e214", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5579, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "MARKET TALK/AU-EQ: Bond Futures Drop On CPI\n\n \n \n\n  [Contact Us: Sydney 61-2-8235-2950; djnews.sydney@dowjones.com] \n\n \n\n  1144 [Dow Jones] September government bond futures down sharply in wake of stronger-than-expected 0.8% rise in 2Q CPI from 1Q, which all but wipes out chances of further RBA easing in current cycle; September 90-day bank bills now at 94.980, indicating no expectation cash rate will be eased from current 5.0% in 3Q.

Even the pound has gained 2%. \n\n  The last time the dollar slipped on this scale against the euro was back in early April, when the single currency rose by more than 3% in a week and bounced above 90 cents. \n\n  That euro rally proved to be a fake-out and the single currency promptly fell into a tailspin which culminated earlier this month with a new low for the year at $0.8350, little more than a cent about its all-time bottom at $0.8230 last October. \n\n  This time, the euro may be able to sustain a recovery as the market's tone has definitely changed. \n\n  \"The euro is now shrugging off every piece of bad news it gets - just like the dollar used to, \" said Greg Salvaggio, trading manager at Tempus Consulting in Washington. \n\n  However, the foreign exchange market is still split on whether this latest euro rally is a real indication that the currency's dog days are over. \n\n  \"I think the euro is going to crash again,\" said Laurie Cameron, currency strategist in the private bank at J.P. Morgan in New York, voting for the euro-bear approach. \n\n  On the other hand, the euro is winning some supporters. In his weekly forecasting outlook, Jim O'Neill, chief economist of Goldman Sachs in London, sees the euro rising to 88 cents in the near term and then breaking above $1.00 by the end of the year. The last time the euro was at parity with the dollar was in January 2000. \n\n  In New York afternoon trading, the euro was at $0.8723, above $0.8715 in London and $0.8710 in New York late Thursday. The dollar was at Y122.95, down from Y123.31 in London and down from Y123.24 late Thursday. \n\n  Three key factors seem to have been at the root of the dollar's problems this week and they bode ill for the U.S. currency in the future. \n\n  First, the U.S. economy is no longer the clear winner in the international growth stakes. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave a downbeat assessment of the economy, in his closely-watched Congressional testimony, stating that risks in the coming months remain clearly to the downside. \n\n  Second, the euro zone is definitely doing a little better and its economic numbers are no longer as damaging as they once were. This week, French industrial production for May increased 0.3%, compared with a 0.4% decline in April. \n\n  Inflation, which has been seen as limiting the European Central Bank's ability to cut interest rates, seems to be abating. Euro-zone consumer prices for June came in at an increase of 0.1% for the month and 3.0% for the year, better than expected. \n\n  Third, and perhaps most worrying, is a lessening of the dollar's domestic and international stature. \n\n  Currency markets have become increasingly confused by the widely publicized debate over the U.S. strong dollar policy. \n\n  There are frequent and vociferous calls for a more exporter-friendly dollar policy and Gordon Richard, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, sees the currency's strength as \"a speculative bubble that refuses to burst and needs to be deflated.\" \n\n  Both President George Bush and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have attempted to still the debate in recent days but without success. The Bush Administration has made it clear, however, it has no intention of altering U.S. sollar policy. \n\n  But doubts about the strong dollar's future are now haunting the U.S. currency's performance aheaqd of this weekend's Group of Seven leading nations' meeting in Genoa, Italy. \n\n  \"The market seems to have caught the bug that the G7 is going to successfully badger the U.S. into abandoning its strong dollar policy,\" said Salvaggio. \"Some major players honestly believe that some modification of policy may be coming - people have been very jittery,\" he added. \n\n  Finally, the dollar's international standing has been hurt in recent weeks by the market's dollar-negative reaction to the ongoing crisis in Argentina and its implications for other emerging markets in Latin America and elsewhere. \n\n  The dollar was sold as rumors of a financial crisis multiplied and the euro may have benefited by association with the Swiss franc. \n\n  \"The reason the European currencies are strong is that the Swiss franc is a safe haven against (problems in) Argentina,\" said Cameron. \n\n  This issue could easily cloud the dollar's future. \"I am still fearful that we haven't seen the end of the problems in Argentina,\" she said and added that Mexico could be hurt also. \n\n  -By John Hardy, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2122; john.hardy@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 20, 2001 14:17 ET (18:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.242989Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:18:32.813890Z", "inner_id": 215, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5584, "annotations": [{"id": 5521, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "2_da1FQCjI", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:20:05.646008Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:20:05.646022Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 92.064, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "6db2c641-dc88-4cae-9bd2-49223cfb92a6", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5584, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Venezuela&apos;s Oil Sector Badly Hurt By 1H &apos;01 Oil Cuts\n\n \n \n\n  (This article was originally published Thursday) \n\n    By Fred Pals \n    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Two consecutive oil production cuts required by agreements with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had a major impact on Venezuela's oil sector in the first half. \n\n  President Hugo Chavez revealed Thursday that the  sector contracted 3% from January to June. \n\n  Despite that contraction, gross domestic product expanded 3.4% in the first half thanks to a strong performance in the non-oil economy. \n\n   \"As you know, we follow a strategy to defend oil prices and keep them in the price band,\" Chavez said. \n\n  OPEC has adopted a price range requiring members to cut production when its reference oil basket slips beneath $22 or increase it when the basket exceeds $28 for a set number of days. \n\n  Once a notorious quota buster, Venezuela has turned into an upstanding member of OPEC under the Chavez administration. Including a third reduction in output effective Sept. 1, the country will have removed some 416,000 barrels a day from the market so far this year in compliance with its OPEC obligations. \n\n  Venezuela's new quota will stand at 2.67 million b/d, a level not seen since early 1998. The country's current quota stands at 2.79 million b/d. \n\n  In Venezuela's $100 billion economy, oil accounts for half of government revenue and 80% of its export earnings. It represents about a third of gross domestic product. \n\n \n   Incipient Criticism After Disappointing Figures \n \n\n  But Venezuela's hawkish position within OPEC is likely to come under fire again with the release of the latest numbers. \n\n  According to Hugo Hernandez Rafalli, the president of the local Petroleum Chamber, Venezuela could end up losing on both market share and oil income if the price-over-production strategy continues without adjustment. \n\n  Industry analysts see enough output from non-OPEC producers coming onstream next year to threaten OPEC's pricing strategy. \n\n  Slowing U.S. and global economies coupled with growing non-OPEC production have combined to put downward pressure on prices, prompting OPEC to cut its aggregate production. \n\n  The 2001 running average of Venezuela's basket of crude oil and refined products stands at $21.90/bbl, down from $25.91/bbl last year. \n\n  Alan Viergutz, a local oil analyst, said OPEC's  strategy to keep prices at the midlevel of the $22 to $28 a barrel range will lead to the worst-case scenario: low prices, low production and much idle output capacity. \n\n  Analysts suggest that at OPEC's target price range, many non-OPEC producers are profitable, and that their production has been coming on stream. \n\n  But the price-over-supply policy is built into Venezuela's budget: the 2001 budget is based on a basket price of $20 a barrel. Officials say a high price nets the country more foreign exchange than increased output. Hence the interest in cutting output to support prices. \n\n  Still, several government officials have already suggested that a lower average target for 2002 would be prudent. \n\n  Rafalli said it would be healthy to lower OPEC's target price to prevent more cutting. \"Lowering the $22 to $28 range is an issue for OPEC to discuss at their next meeting in September,\" Rafalli said. \n\n  However, there are some bright spots ahead. Given an expected increase in seasonal demand, OPEC is unlikely to cut its oil production a fourth time this year. Also, state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. usually starts spending most of its budget during the second half of the year on maintenance works. \n\n  That should spur economic activity among the sector's ancillary goods and services businesses, which have been directly affected by the country's oil cuts. \n\n  -By Fred Pals, Dow Jones Newswires; 58-212-5641339; fred.pals@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 24, 2001 08:58 ET (12:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243021Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:20:05.867074Z", "inner_id": 216, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5585, "annotations": [{"id": 5522, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "biDXFvmDd9", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:21:55.182232Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T13:11:40.407770Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 184.712, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e6a30c60-0528-4b60-8175-8487aa16efcc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5585, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "MARKET TALK: Hughes May See More Enticing Offer\n\n \n \n   Edited by Thomas Granahan \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n   (Call Us: 201 938-5299; All Times Eastern) \n \n   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT \n \n\n  10:44 (Dow Jones) DirecTV-owner Hughes Electronics (GMH), which received a $30.4 billion unsolicited bid from rival EchoStar (DISH) Sunday, is likely to receive a sweeter offer - either from previous bidder News Corp.

But Toshiba also followed the pack by insisting that its myriad business units are more valuable together than apart. \n\n  The company's move was sparked by a plunge in world-wide semiconductor prices. Toshiba expects a 94 billion yen ($782.9 million) operating loss in semiconductors in the year ending March 31, 2002, almost all of it from memory chips. Toshiba's revised outlook for the year calls for a group net loss of 115 billion yen, compared with a 96 billion yen net profit in the year ended March 31, 2001. Sales are expected to fall 3.4% to 5.75 trillion yen. \n\n  The specifics of the job cuts remain unclear, but no one is being fired or laid off. Toshiba said it expects attrition to account for about half of the 20,000-job reduction, while the other half would come from restructuring some of its units, and voluntary early retirement. However, the cuts, which amount to nearly 14% of the company's jobs in Japan, won't be completed until March 2004. Toshiba said it expects its domestic work force to total around 127,000 then, compared with 144,000 now, because it also plans to hire several thousand people in the meantime. \n\n  Investors welcomed the news, bidding Toshiba's stock price up 5.6% to 604 yen a share, outpacing a 1% gain on the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. \n\n  President Tadashi Okamura declined to comment on what is expected to be the biggest of the restructuring moves - a merger of Toshiba's memory-chip business with either Infineon Technologies AG of Germany or South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. People familiar with the situation said over the weekend that Toshiba is discussing a deal with the two companies but Mr. Okamura refused to confirm the talks. \n\n  Despite the cuts, Mr. Okamura insisted that Toshiba will remain a comprehensive electronics maker - known as sogo denki - amid the growing challenge of controlling an unwieldy array of business units. Toshiba's products include electronics parts such as semiconductors; consumer electronics such as TV sets, personal computers and mobile telephones; and heavy industrial equipment. \n\n  \"The biggest feature of Toshiba is that we produce synergy effects\" from the various businesses, said Mr. Okamura. He said he plans to transfer more power to the heads of company units, while at the same time encouraging those unit leaders to work more closely with each other. \n\n  Fujitsu Ltd., which announced 16,400 job cuts last week, also said it has no plans to abandon the sogo denki model. Fujitsu's president, Naoyuki Akikusa, acknowledged that American companies such as Intel Corp. have been successful by focusing on a single product area, but added, \"We don't think that is the ideal for our industry.\" \n\n  The problem with the sogo denki model is the failure of Japanese electronics companies to produce consistent profits. Most made only modest amounts of money even during the information-technology bubble that gripped the U.S. last year.

The central bank promised in March to maintain its loose policy until consumer prices - which have slid unabated for two years - clearly stop falling. \n\n  But the BOJ hasn't bound itself specifically to making prices turn around, only to waiting until the consumer price index stabilizes at zero or above year-on-year. \n\n  Hayami again this week insisted he's not considering inflation targets. The bank has long argued that targets have worked in bringing down high inflation but that setting an inflation goal for a deflationary economy would damage the bank's credibility since there are no convincing ways to achieve the target. \n\n  \"The BOJ governor is now against inflation targeting but it won't be surprising if he reverses that view,\" Kobayashi said. \"He used to be against buying JGBs too.\" \n\n  How could the BOJ create inflation? \n\n  \"Buy more mid- and long-term JGBs and increase the reserve target by around Y10 trillion,\" said dovish former BOJ official Mitsuhiro Fukao. He thinks the BOJ should target CPI rises of 2% to 8% over three years. \n\n  The BOJ now limits the size of JGBs it can hold to the outstanding amount of banknotes issued. \n\n  \"The BOJ should get rid of that limit and flood the banking system,\" said Fukao, a Keio University professor. \n\n  If that doesn't work after a year, he says, the BOJ ought to go for broke and buy other assets such as certain stock indexes or real estate investment trusts. \n\n  \"I think the time is near when the BOJ should go ahead with these drastic measures,\" Fukao said. \n\n  BOJ officials, in fact, aren't saying never. \n\n  \"If the (BOJ and the market) can agree that the situation is so critical that taking such a reckless step is necessary, then we can go ahead and by stocks or land,\" one BOJ official said. \n\n  \"We wouldn't take such a step unless the economy paints an ultra-bleak picture\" said another. \"But nonetheless, it is an option.\" \n\n  That might just happen. \n\n  The economy continues to head south and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's promised structural reforms - curbing government debt and cleaning up the wobbly banks - will only hurt demand and inflame deflation in the short run. \n\n  \"As long as the government is shrinking fiscal spending, there will always be pressure on the BOJ to ease,\" said economist Masaaki Kanno at JP Morgan Chase Asia. \n\n  Market watchers generally don't expect the BOJ's next move right away. \n\n  But, then again, they didn't expect the policy board to budge Tuesday, either. \n\n \n   -By Yukiko Tsuba, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; yukiko.tsuba@dowjones.com \n   (Michiyo Seki contributed to this report.) \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 16, 2001 21:45 ET (01:45 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243122Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243127Z", "inner_id": 219, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5588, "annotations": [{"id": 4468, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "DkVZBmAAy1", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282437Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282442Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 558.402, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "ab9a57cd-ebc9-40c2-b1f5-00e87bfa0b32", "import_id": 328, "last_action": null, "task": 5588, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Mueller Upbeat On German Econ Prospects - Handelsblatt\n\n \n \n\n  DUESSELDORF (Handelsblatt)--In an interview with Handelsblatt, German Economics Minister Werner Mueller painted a relatively upbeat picture of the prospects for Europe's largest economy. \n\n  \"We are seeing a turnaround in the fortunes of both the Dax-30 leading-share index and the euro, and inflation is likely to fall below 2% by the end of the year,\" he said, noting that a decline in inflation is needed to spur consumer spending and give leverage to the country's tax reform.

After two years of dramatic decline, the industry has now clearly seen the worst, he said. \n\n  And where, as at present, company's stocks are running down to the point where they need to be replenished, this is surely a clear sign that production is set to take off again, Mueller added. On top of that, there are industries, such as car assembly, that continue to boom. \n\n  \"There's sufficient dynamism there for real growth in gross domestic product of up to 3% in the first half of 2002,\" Mueller said.

Last May they found a better rate in three minutes by using an Internet site, saving them $6,300 in the first five years. \n\n  Yes, even after the dot-com crash and in the middle of a global slowdown, there's still a way to make money off the Internet: refinance your home. As interest rates tumble, opportunities for refinancing abound. And banks are working harder than ever to woo the average homeowner to compensate for a dwindling number of corporate clients. In Hong Kong, competition has become so intense that banks have lowered mortgage rates faster than the central bank has dropped its key rate. Average long-term floating mortgage rates there were around 1 percentage point above the prime rate three years ago; now, banks are giving home loans at close to 3% percentage points below prime. \n\n  \"Banks are shaving their (rates) quite quickly to keep their customers from walking down the street,\" to another bank, says Alistair Scarff, regional banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. That's where Web sites come in. \n\n  The last time rates were this low few people were using the Internet. Then, someone searching for the lowest rate for a new home mortgage had to do it the old-fashioned way, by comparing newspaper ads and television commercials in order to calculate the savings. \n\n  Many Web sites allow you to compare the rates on offer from the banks in your area. Some sites even have tools to help you calculate savings. A few will even let you join forces with other borrowers to get better terms. \n\n  The Singapore-based dollarDEX.com Pte. Ltd. (www.dollardex.com) for example, posts refinancing rates from more than 20 banks covering Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. In Hong Kong, the range goes from 2.75% to 4.00% for the first year of a refinancing loan. That translates to savings of as much as $12,500 on that year's payments on a $1 million loan. \n\n  Of course, refinancing is more complicated than the rate for the first year. You have to consider the rate of your current loan as well as any fees or penalties you might incur if you cancel it. You also have to look at how the rates and restrictions on a new loan will change in the future. The better mortgage sites help you break down all these factors to find the best loan package without having to waste a weekend calculating what your monthly payments might be five years from now. \n\n  With online refinancing calculators you just plug in the rate you are paying now, the amount you want to borrow and the fees you expect to pay and they tell you how much money you would save, if any, by refinancing. Five minutes with the calculator on the Singapore site Propbuzz.com.sg Pte. Ltd. will show how you can save more than $500 a year for the next five years if you refinance a three-year-old loan for $200,000. \n\n  The better Web sites will also list special promotions from each bank so you can compare them. Lenders are giving out freebies these days like premium credit cards and fire insurance as well as waiving legal fees and other costs of applying for a new home loan. \n\n  With property prices slipping in Asia, it's important to refinance your loan as soon as possible. Richard Lai, director at dollarDEX.com, says the number of applications coming through his site has surged in the past two months on concerns about falling prices. If the value of a home falls to below the amount of money owed on the mortgage, any refinancing requires the homeowner to put up more money. \n\n  \"Those who are refinancing want to do it quickly, otherwise they won't be able to,\" Mr. Lai says. \n\n  Still, you have to be careful about the sites you use. Most property sites are little more than online real-estate ads and many have outdated information and old loan rates. We found a few with information and functions useful to anyone looking into refinancing. \n\n  --- \n\n  Send comments to eric.bellman@awsj.com \n\n  --- \n\n                      Online Finance \n \n  www.redas.com \n  What clicks: The site's comprehensive calculator lets you put in all the terms of your current loan (other sites only let you put in one interest rate). \n  It's full of news, data and analysis from the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore, which maintains the site. \n  What doesn't: It only has refinancing rates from four lenders. \n  It's only for the Singapore market. \n \n  www.e-finance.com.hk \n  What clicks: Shows rates from nine banks.

Welcome to Latin America. \n\n  Perhaps no other region in the world will suffer more from the economic shock waves of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A U.S. economic recession would practically halt growth throughout the region, especially in Mexico, which sells nearly 90% of its exports to the U.S. Uncertainty caused by the attacks will also make it harder for Latin companies and governments to borrow the money they need to pay off existing debt and to invest. And with fewer foreign visitors, tourism will be stung everywhere from Baja California to Buenos Aires. \n\n  Like Wall Street, Latin America's financial markets have taken a beating since the attacks. Brazil's real is at record lows, and Argentina's stock market is at its lowest level in a decade. \"We're suffering contagion from the U.S. crisis,\" says Guillermo Ortiz, the head of Mexico's central bank. Latin America may have exported plenty of financial crises of its own in the past, including Mexico's \"tequila crisis\" from the 1994-95 peso devaluation. But this time, the financial earthquake is coming from an unexpected quarter: the world's bedrock economy. \n\n  Following the attacks, the Inter-American Development Bank cut its forecast for regional economic growth this year by half, to a paltry 1%. Most economists expect Latin American economies to rebound only after the U.S. stages its own recovery, expected next year. Even before the attack, a slowing U.S. economy had stopped Mexico in its tracks after 7% growth in gross domestic product last year. Factories assembling TV sets and automotive parts for the U.S. market have laid off 100,000 workers in Ciudad Juarez alone this year, economists say. \n\n  The attacks came as Argentina's often turbulent debt crisis had reached a period of relative calm. Indeed, the region's governments have already raised the bulk of the estimated $13 billion in debt this year that they needed to refinance. Some Argentine officials even suggest the U.S. woes could make places like faraway Buenos Aires look safer. \"As a whole, I would think that local uncertainty is less than global uncertainty,\" says Mario Blejer, vice president of Argentina's central bank. \n\n  But borrowing next year could be difficult if the crisis drags on and investors run for cover. Since the attacks, the difference in average interest rates on Argentine and Brazilian government debt compared with those on U.S. debt -- a common measure of country risk -- has widened by about a percentage point. Acknowledging the powerlessness of policy makers in the current global environment, Brazilian Central Bank Governor Arminio Fraga said he has \"no rabbit to pull out of the hat.\" \n\n  Companies expected to borrow in the coming months must wait, including anticipated deals like Mexican cement giant Cemex's $300 million offering of five-year debt. And companies with short-term debt could face trouble. The first warning shot came when Mexican auto-parts maker Corporacion San Luis SA skipped payment of $9.8 million on $200 million in debt. \n\n  Reducing perceptions of risk seems a priority. Mexico's top policy makers have agreed to push harder on a series of stalled reforms to the country's tax system and energy sector. Mexico's message to U.S. companies: \"Why go to a riskier country in a place like Asia when you can go next door to Mexico?\" says Mr. Ortiz. Even if Mexico manages to pass a tax reform to give the government more money, however, an upgrade of Mexico's debt rating by Standard and Poor's may not follow. \n\n  Tourism will suffer, too. Mexico takes in some $8 billion a year from visitors, and Cuba nearly $2 billion, more than half its foreign-exchange income. Taxis idling in wait for customers outside Havana's hotels are a bad harbinger for the island's communist regime, which has struggled to boost the economy since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Latin American airlines from Mexicana to Varig are shedding workers. \n\n  Oil is a wild card for regional players like Venezuela, where oil exports represent 40% of its total economy. Weaker demand in the U.S. and Europe could hurt oil receipts unless a Middle Eastern crisis cuts off key Persian Gulf supplies. Indeed, oil prices are already dropping from the panicky spike that followed the attack. Benchmark prices are now below their pre-attack levels. \n\n  --- \n\n  Marc Lifsher in Caracas, Venezuela, and Joel Millman in San Diego contributed to this article. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 23, 2001 19:42 ET (23:42 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243221Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243226Z", "inner_id": 222, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5591, "annotations": [{"id": 4471, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "5oE62bGoj1", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282521Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282526Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 352.475, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "4f531c30-7c1c-46a0-8435-9b8c394c0ebe", "import_id": 331, "last_action": null, "task": 5591, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Rivlin: US Fed Risks Exhausting Ability To Boost Economy\n\n \n \n\n  By Joseph Rebello \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--A former top Federal Reserve official warned Wednesday that the U.S. central bank risks running out of ammunition in its fight to boost economic growth if it cuts interest rates too rapidly. \n\n  Alice Rivlin, a Fed vice chairman for three years until June 1999, said she would favor a cut in the federal funds rate of just a quarter-percentage point when the Fed's top policymakers next meet Oct. 2. Most economists predict a half-point cut in the central bank's key interest rate, which would leave the rate at 2.5%, the lowest level since the early 1960s. \n\n  \"The Fed has to begin worrying about how fast it wants to move the fed funds rate down, because it wants to preserve the ability to keep doing (interest-rate cuts) longer,\" Rivlin said. She spoke at a panel discussion on the country's need for additional economic stimulus in the wake of devastating terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon on Sept. 11. \n\n  The Fed has cut the funds rate eight times this year, lowering it by 3.5 percentage points in what has been its fastest campaign of rate cuts in decades. The cuts have had little visible effect on the economy, which stalled in the spring and may have been tipped into a recession by the attacks. \n\n  The Fed, as a result, has said it is inclined to cut keep cutting rates. In addition, it has pumped unprecedented sums of money into the banking system. \n\n  Rivlin predicted the Fed will continue to cut interest rates. But she said the central bank now may need to avoid large cuts. \"The Fed doesn't want to get into the situation of the Bank of Japan, where interest rates are zero and there's nothing more they can do,\" Rivlin told reporters after the discussion. She said that if she were a Fed policymaker debating interest-cuts next week, \"I think I might do a quarter\"-percentage-point cut. \n\n  Congress and the Bush administration are right to consider additional ways to boost the economy, through a combination of tax cuts and spending increases, Rivlin said. But she said the government should carefully consider the nature of tax cuts or spending increases it makes. \n\n  \"The major rule is not to make this moment an excuse for everybody's tax or spending program,\" she said. \"If we have a good case for additional tax cuts, especially at the lower end, and additional spending, then we ought to do it.\" \n\n  She said that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's estimate that the country may need an economic-stimulus package  worth about $100 billion - including $40 billion in funds to rebuild Wall Street and the Pentagon - was reasonable. \"A hundred billion is a nice, round number,\" Rivlin said. \"It's certainly a good place to start.\" But she said that it will be hard to know how much money will be enough until more information is available about the damage caused by the attacks. \n\n  The stimulus, Rivlin said, is unlikely to cause the economy to overheat anytime in the near future. The depth of the U.S. economic slump, the rising unemployment rate and the decline in energy prices, she said, have defused any risk of inflation. \"I think we're in a non-inflationary situation for the foreseeable future,\" Rivlin said. \n\n  -By Joseph Rebello, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9279; joseph.rebello@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 26, 2001 12:58 ET (16:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243253Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243258Z", "inner_id": 223, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5592, "annotations": [{"id": 4472, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "f_Dz2esJ26", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282549Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282555Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 196.061, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "526777ab-3c97-430f-a105-ba85403b71cb", "import_id": 332, "last_action": null, "task": 5592, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "AWSJ(9/24)Japanese Govt Starts Crackdown On Bad-Debt Problem\n\n \n  By Peter Landers \n  Staff Reporter \n\n  TOKYO -- The terror in the U.S. has delivered a big shock to Japan, the world's weakest economic giant. But events last week suggest that Japanese leaders are beginning to see it also as an excuse to make tough decisions that will help the nation break out of its funk. \n\n  The government on Friday announced a new crackdown on banks' bad loans, which are at the heart of Japan's decade-long economic woes. The policy calls for tighter inspections of banks and more attention to \"market signals\" - a veiled reference to plunging stock prices and credit ratings of troubled borrowers such as supermarket chain Daiei Inc. \n\n  \"We will greatly tighten our assessment of assets,\" said Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka, who is Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's point man for economic reform. Mr. Takenaka quoted Mr. Koizumi as telling a meeting of ministers, \"We are in the process of achieving what was thought to be unachievable.\" \n\n  Such promises, of course, have been made before. In the past decade Japanese banks have consistently played down their bad loans, putting aside only minimal reserves even for loans to companies that were clearly on their last legs. Past governments, fearing higher unemployment and temporary economic pain, have encouraged or winked at this tactic. But it has left the economy overloaded with crippled companies too weak to do anything except go ever deeper into debt. \n\n  Mr. Koizumi might have an easier path than his predecessors, because he has made clear many times that his reforms will be painful and he still retains strong public support. The bankruptcy of retailer Mycal Corp. on Sept. 14, the second-largest nonfinancial bankruptcy in Japan's history, received favorable market reaction and little of the teeth-gnashing in the Japanese press that accompanied earlier big failures. \n\n  \"Barring strong public opposition, a bad-loan resolution looks more realistic than at any time in the past decade,\" Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., wrote in a note to clients. \n\n  Still, it's too early to say whether Mr. Koizumi can succeed, because many details remain unclear. The most important is how to use public funds to prop up the banking system. If banks conduct stricter assessments of their loans, many would have to record huge losses. Analysts say some banks could become insolvent as a result and most others will be undercapitalized. \n\n  Daiei, the supermarket operator, and some troubled construction companies are likely to be test cases of how sensitive the government is to \"market signals.\" Daiei's share price fell 12% Friday, closing near a record low after it lowered its sales and profit forecasts. Daiei has more than two trillion yen ($17.23 billion) in interest-bearing debt and virtually no operating profit to repay its loans. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's credit rating Friday to Caa1, which means Daiei's bonds are in \"poor standing\" and in danger of default. \n\n  By the twisted logic of Japanese politics, Mr. Koizumi will have a better chance the worse the crisis gets. History has shown that Japan responds best when under severe duress - the most recent example coming in October 1998, when parliament passed a bank bailout to stave off a near-meltdown in the financial system. \n\n  The terror attacks in the U.S. may have also handed the Bank of Japan an excuse to wriggle out of a policy that was drawing intense criticism. The central bank has long resisted radical measures to eliminate deflation but is now beginning to adopt some steps advocated by critics because of the deteriorating global economy. \n\n  Several times last week the Bank of Japan conducted what is known as \"unsterilized intervention\" in currency markets as it sold yen for dollars. Normally when the bank sells yen it \"sterilizes\" the transaction by removing an equal amount of yen from circulation. In effect, unsterilized intervention means dumping a batch of new yen notes into circulation, the sort of monetary easing that proponents hope will create inflationary expectations among Japanese consumers. \n\n  The central bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, is a staunch foe of easing but his position appears to have weakened, in part due to attacks from a vocal group of ruling party legislators. \"The last 10 years of monetary policy by the BOJ have been a total failure,\" says Yoichi Masuzoe, a former politics professor who was asked by Mr. Koizumi to run for parliament in July elections and won easily. \n\n  --- \n\n  Journal Link: What do you think Japan should do to boost its flagging economy?

(A.SBG) Chief Executive Tom Park as its new head, effective mid-October. \n\n  This came as Goodman said profit before significant nonrecurring items for the year ended June 30 slipped to A$118 million, pressured by increased wheat and petroleum costs. \n\n  Including one-time items, Goodman recorded a A$78.3 million net loss due to a A$196.3 million restructuring charge as it looked to focus on its retail branded food businesses. \n\n  However, the profit before one-time items was within market expectations. Sales for the period gained 1.1% to A$3.22 billion. \n\n  Investment bank ABN AMRO upgraded Goodman Fielder to Add from Reduce following the appointment of Park. The investment bank believes his appointment will \"see an acceleration of business improvement. We were impressed with the improvements Tom Park made at Southcorp wines in the year he was there.\" \n\n  Existing CEO David Hearn said earlier in 2001 he would depart before his five-year contract ended in 2003. Under Hearn's leadership, Goodman Fielder has whittled its operations to a core portfolio of branded businesses. \n\n  \"I love the food business, I'm thrilled to death to be back in it,\" Park told reporters. \n\n  Shares in the company ended up 1.8 cents, or 1.4%, at A$1.32. \n\n \n              Company Expects Better FY02 \n \n\n  Turning to the latest earnings, Hearn said, \"The performance of our milling & baking business in both Australia and New Zealand was adversely affected by rising input costs, including higher wheat and petroleum prices.\" \n\n  Still, Chairman Jon Peterson said the company is confident of improving its performance in the next 12 months. \n\n  \"At this early stage of the year, the business is trading satisfactorily, which gives us confidence that we will improve performance in 2002,\" Peterson said. \n\n  The company also said it expects to make A$90 million of cost savings in fiscal 2001-02. \n\n  In June, Goodman Fielder detailed a profit warning and, anticipating the market's negative reaction, said it would look for a new chief executive and accelerate restructuring plans to clean up before 2001-02. \n\n  The previously detailed sale of the company's Leiner Davis Gelatin business is moving through a regulatory process in the U.S., while the sale of the Germantown specialty ingredients business is expected to take place in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. \n\n  Goodman's Hearn reiterated that the company is keen to conduct a A$200 million share buyback, but that is mainly contingent on U.S. approval of the gelatin division sale. \n\n  One Sydney-based analyst said a delay in a much-expected share buyback is a minor disappointment. \n\n  In addition to the Leiner Davis and Germantown disposals, Goodman Fielder's restructuring plan included the integration in New Zealand of GF Milling and Baking, Bluebird and Meadow Lee into a single national food business. This was followed in Australia by the combining of Uncle Tobys and Meadow Lea into a \"billion dollar\" grocery business. \n\n  Goodman will pay an unchanged total dividend of 7.5 cents a share. \n\n  -By Ambereen Choudhury, Dow Jones Newswires; \n\n  61-2-8235-2965; ambereen.choudhury@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 07, 2001 02:35 ET (06:35 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243318Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243323Z", "inner_id": 225, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5594, "annotations": [{"id": 4474, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "iOOKxx6qt9", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282616Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282621Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 161.419, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "0da55f7e-0072-4dd6-ac9a-d85e61c54c55", "import_id": 334, "last_action": null, "task": 5594, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Schroeder: EU Economic Support Plan May Be Needed In 4Q\n\n \n   (This item was originally published Thursday.) \n \n\n  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder held out the prospect of a European Union initiative to boost the economy even as he emphasized the need for budget discipline across the 15-member bloc. \n\n  At a press conference in Quedlinburg with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Schroeder indicated the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. could justify E.U. economic-support measures. \n\n  \"The task in the current situation is to observe the markets very closely, to see how the U.S., Japanese and European markets after Sept. 11 develop,\" Schroeder said. \"Then we'll see during the course of the last quarter of the year whether it's necessary to undertake something.\" \n\n  Schroeder said any unilateral German economic-support measure would be pointless. \"We live in a globalized world, in global markets and so there's no sense in talking about any national programs,\" he said. \n\n  The comments follow the announcement this week of a U.S. government economic-stimulus proposal of up to $75 billion, in the form of tax cuts and new spending. \n\n  But the remarks also come amid relatively tight budget constraints on E.U. governments. E.U. members are committed under their 1997 Stability and Growth Pact to aim for budgets in balance or surplus in the medium term, and to ensure deficits don't exceed 3.0% of gross domestic product in any one year. \n\n \n   Budget Discipline Seen Key \n \n\n  Schroeder said Germany and its E.U. partners must heed the Stability and Growth Pact. \n\n  \"The agreed budget consolidation course in Europe must be continued,\" he said. \n\n  Those remarks come nearly two months after German Finance Minister Hans Eichel cast doubt on the E.U. budget pact, saying it didn't give states enough leeway to overshoot annual public-sector deficit targets during an economic slowdown. \n\n  Eichel, the architect of a budget-austerity program to tackle Germany's debt mountain, has since insisted he didn't intend to spark a debate about loosening the budget accord. \n\n  In any case, Schroeder appeared to rule out any imminent E.U. economic-support measures, in part because they could alarm the European Central Bank, which runs monetary policy in the 12-member euro zone. \n\n  \"In the current situation, I would advise against hasty announcements,\" he said. \"Hasty announcements could have negative consequences for the actors responsible for monetary policy.\" \n\n  A German Finance Ministry official said the government remained committed to its austerity plan, which seeks to balance the federal budget by 2006 through steady cuts in new borrowing. \n\n  The official reiterated a ministry claim that new tax cuts and large spending programs couldn't be justified and downplayed the likelihood of any other economic-stimulus measures. \n\n  That said, the official didn't rule out the possibility of a modest E.U. economic-support initiative before the end of the year. \n\n  Many economists expect German real gross domestic product growth to slow to 1.0% or below this year, from 3.0% in 2000. The slowdown would result mainly from global economic weakness, particularly in the U.S., and recent high energy and food prices. \n\n  The Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. have diminished the chances of a German economic rebound later this year, and arguably have clouded the outlook for early 2002. \n\n  -By Jonathan Stearns, Dow Jones Newswires; +49 30 288 8410; jonathan.stearns@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 05, 2001 02:21 ET (06:21 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243349Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243355Z", "inner_id": 226, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5595, "annotations": [{"id": 4475, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "L0j4ZSfWiu", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282644Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282650Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 1594.892, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "29d0c4fd-31ab-4da6-8cb8-45860c9bb6f8", "import_id": 335, "last_action": null, "task": 5595, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DATA SNAP: NZ&apos;s 3Q CPI Rises In Line With Expectations\n\n \n========================================================= \nNZ CPI       % Change   % Change    !Surprise: No       !

'And core inflation really isn't doing anything right now - it's moving sideways, but I expect it will begin to drop lower in the next few months and into next year as the economy continues to slow down.' \n\n  Other analysts predict that another contributor to lower inflation rates in coming CPI data will likely be aggressive Christmas season discounting by retailers eager to boost fragile consumer confidence in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the unfolding U.S. anthrax scare. \n\n \n   BOC, Economists' CPI Forecasts Point To Lower Rates \n \n\n  All told, neither September's CPI data nor CPI reports in coming months are likely to deter the Bank of Canada from easing interest rates further to cope with the fallout from September 11 on an already faltering economy. \n\n  When it eased interest rates at the end of August, the central bank said it expected 'reduced pressures on production capacity and inflation through the rest of this year and into 2002,' and Bank officials have stuck to this view in subsequent statements. \n\n  On Tuesday, Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Malcolm Knight said in Toronto that the more pronounced economic weakening that has taken place since September 11 will keep inflation on a downward trajectory. \n\n  'World petroleum prices have recently been volatile, but assuming that on average they remain around current levels, overall CPI inflation should continue its recent downward trend,' he said. \n\n  Most economists have no trouble in subscribing to this view, along with its implication that inflation will be no impediment to continued Bank of Canada rate easing on Tuesday, and likely at the central bank's last rate announcement of the year on November 27. \n\n  Senior economist Marc Levesque of Toronto-Dominion Bank said that the September CPI data should be 'little more than a blip on the radar screen, given current economic conditions.' \n\n  'In any event, core inflation will remain close to the mid-point of the Bank of Canada's 1%-3% target band - leaving the Bank with all the necessary leeway to continue to cut interest rates,' Levesque noted in a recent commentary. \n\n  - By Paul Evans, Dow Jones Newswires; (416) 306-2022 \n\n  paulr.evans@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 17, 2001 14:03 ET (18:03 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243440Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243445Z", "inner_id": 229, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5598, "annotations": [{"id": 4478, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "oQq2pJGImq", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282729Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282735Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 152.35, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "1f49e69e-b5be-4813-9b80-9a227d8ce3ec", "import_id": 338, "last_action": null, "task": 5598, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "AWSJ(10/22) Convention Business Is Battered In Asia\n\n \n  By Cris Prystay \n  Staff Reporter \n\n  First, it was the British car dealers, then the European pharmacists. The bankers from Hong Kong were next. \n\n  About 80% of conferences booked at Hyatt International Corp.'s Bali Hyatt in November have been canceled in recent weeks, and general manager Brad Kirk is bracing for more. He is on tenterhooks waiting to hear back from 450 computer techies scheduled for a date early next year. \n\n  \"Absolutely nobody is confirming for the first quarter,\" he says. \"It's a pretty serious situation.\" \n\n  Asia's multibillion dollar conference and exhibition business, already wobbly from the slowing global economy, is getting battered by America's war on terror. In Singapore, 24,000 hotel-room nights were left empty after the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, called off a five-day industry exhibition just one week before the start date. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.'s Sheraton Nusa Indah Resort in Bali lost half a million dollars in revenue when the World Bridge Championship pulled the plug, leaving a gaping hole of 2,700 room nights. The industry itself isn't immune: This week, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives called off its industry seminar in Kuala Lumpur on recession-proof travel management. \n\n  Corporate events are big business for hotels and other organizers in Asia. \n\n  Only four cities in the world played host to more international meetings in 2000 than Singapore, according to the Union of International Associations. Meetings, conventions and exhibitions contributed 1.13 billion Singapore dollars (US$624.3 million) to that economy last year. \n\n  In Bali, conferences account for 25% of Mr. Kirk's business, and 40% at the nearby Sheraton Nusa Indah Resort, which manages the Bali International Convention Centre. \n\n  The scratching of the Swift convention, which was slated to draw more than 6,000 bankers and finance professionals, has made the biggest splash so far. \"In 38 years of being in the business, I've never seen this large an event canceled just (a few) days out,\" says Robert Guy, managing director of Pacific World Destination Management Pte. Ltd., which coordinated the event in Singapore. \n\n  The board of Belgium-based Swift met after the Sept. 11 attacks, but opted to go ahead. Once bombs started falling on Afghanistan, the board changed its mind. \"It was the announcement that more (terrorism) was to come, anywhere, at any time, that did it. If something did happen, an important part of the world's payments community would be far away from where they needed to be,\" said Leonard Schrank, Swift's chief executive officer. Many financial institutions have slapped a ban on corporate travel, which would prevent delegates from reaching Singapore anyway. \n\n  A group of 15 hotels are now negotiating with Swift for compensation. \"We're trying to come up with an amicable solution, and we recognize our obligations,\" said Patrik Neutjens, director of the Swift International Banking Operational Seminar. Mr. Schrank estimates Swift's total loss, including the hotel settlement, refunded fees and lost preproduction costs, will come to about $10 million. \n\n  After Swift withdrew, Nat Wong scrambled to keep his own client from opting out. Mr. Wong, the CEO of Meeting Planners International Pte. Ltd., hired an emergency team of telemarketers to tell the 18,000 people who had registered for the International Textile Machinery Exhibition that despite the start of bombing raids in Afghanistan, it was safe to come ahead. \n\n  But that crisis was quickly overtaken by another: On Oct. 11, the Singapore government imposed new visa restrictions on travelers from five countries, including Pakistan, Iran and Egypt -- home to some 2,500 of the exhibition's delegates. After a meeting with government officials, Mr. Wong obtained approval the following Saturday morning for a visa waiver for his delegates -- just two days before the five-day event was to begin.  \"I was sitting in bed, on my handphone at 3 a.m. both Saturday and Sunday night,\" he says. \"It was absolutely crazy.\" In the end, about 14,000 people, from 67 countries, turned up for the convention last week. \n\n  Conventions and exhibitions aren't the only casualty in the function business. In Malaysia, the inaugural Le Mans auto racing Series Race of Champions was postponed for \"international security concerns.\" U.S. promoter Don King canceled a world heavyweight boxing title match scheduled for Beijing next month after broadcaster HBO, citing U.S. State Department advisories, expressed concerns about sending employees to China. \n\n  Even government conferences aren't unaffected. The Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting scheduled for Brisbane, Australia, from Oct. 6 to Oct. 9, was postponed after a large number of government leaders indicated they might not be able to come. Only 29 of 56 tourism ministers from Organization of Islamic Conference, or OIC, states turned up at a ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Oct. 12. \n\n  Event organizers are scrambling to cut deals with airlines and hotels to keep some of this business from drying up. The Sheraton Nusa Indah Resort is now offering 40% off for any group of 10 or more. Singapore-based Pacific World, which served as organizer for the now-scotched Swift exhibition, managed to win a 200-person convention that had canceled in Dubai after it wrung an extra 20% discount on pre-Sept. 11 prices from airlines and Singapore hotels. Singapore Exhibition Services Pte. Ltd., meanwhile, is pledging extra services, such as company visits and tailored seminars. \n\n  Another survival tactic is to target Asia-based customers, who have proved far more resilient than those outside the region. \"We're going to look at markets closer to home,\" said Mr. Guy, at Pacific World, which traditionally specialized on the long-haul corporate travel and convention market. \n\n  Singapore Exhibition Services, for instance, managed to draw a record 8,500 people to a three-day annual franchise exhibition that kicked off Sept. 19, just days after terrorists struck New York and Washington. Only 14% of that crowd came from outside Singapore. \n\n  In Bali, the handful of conventions that have kept their bookings have all come from within Asia, says Raymond Tait, director of sales and marketing for the Bali International Convention Centre. \"The long-haul market won't be as prevalent next year because people just don't want to go the distance,\" he says. \n\n  --- \n\n  Zach Coleman contributed to this article. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 21, 2001 17:01 ET (21:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243482Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243487Z", "inner_id": 230, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5599, "annotations": [{"id": 4479, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "tCBh6fdF8F", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282758Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282763Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 943.502, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "577dcffa-03ad-4ac7-a2e0-72912ef9634e", "import_id": 339, "last_action": null, "task": 5599, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DJ Oil Stocks -2: Shares Rebound After Morning Losses &gt;BHI\n\n \n \n   By Lingling Wei \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n \n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Shares of oil drillers and service companies rebounded \nfrom morning losses Friday after the price outlook for crude oil was further \nmuddled by Russia's refusal to acquiesce to the bigger output cut called for by \nthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n \n  Russia, the second-largest oil exporter after OPEC, agreed to reduce its \nexports by 50,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year, a move which fell \nbelow OPEC's expectations. \n \n  The cartel ministers, who met in Vienna last week in hope of shoring up oil \nprices, have decided to put off planned production cuts until Russia, Norway \nand other non-OPEC countries join in. \n \n  Without a joint agreement, some analysts speculated that crude prices, having \ndropped 30% since mid-September, could fall to $15 per barrel over the next few \nmonths, while others projected a price level around $20 a barrel. \n \n  George Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co., said a larger \nproduction-cut agreement between Russia and OPEC remains possible in the next \ntwo to three weeks. \n \n  But even if that happens, Gaspar said, \"what the market is failing to \nrecognize is that there is a considerable buildup (of oil production) among \nnon-OPEC members,\" including Norway, Angola and Brazil. The capacity buildup \ncould still result in a crude glut given the sagging oil demand amid the \neconomic slowdown worldwide. \n \n  Gaspar estimated that non-OPEC members will produce nearly 2% more oil a day \nnext year, further diminishing the cartel's grip on world oil prices. \n \n  Falling crude prices tend to discourage exploration and production companies \nfrom committing to long-term projects. \"Spending is going to be skinny in the \nfirst half of next year,\" Gaspar said, as compared with the projected 18% \ngrowth in overall capital expenditures by oil explorers and producers this \nyear. \n \n  Kevin Simpson, an oil service analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., wrote in a \nmorning note that \"we assume that upstream capital expenditure will fall 7.5% \nin 2002, with the U.S. down 20% and overseas relatively flat.\" \n \n  Simpson reduced his 2002 earnings estimates for 10 oil service companies, \nincluding Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI), Halliburton Co. (HAL), Schlumberger Ltd. \n(SLB), BJ Services Co. (BJS), Cooper Cameron Corp. (CAM) and Transocean Sedco \nForex Inc. (RIG). \n \n  But Simpson said the lowered earnings forecasts are already priced into the \ncompanies' stocks. \"Investors are beginning to look past the near-term earnings \ntrough to potential second-half cyclical recovery in assessing the oil service \ngroup.\" \n \n  In recent market activity, many oil stocks rebounded from initial losses, \nwith Transocean - earlier the biggest percentage loser in the sector - trading \nup 1.2%, or 33 cents, to $28.84, and Schlumberger up 0.6%, or 27 cents, to \n$47.48. \n \n  Industry leader Exxon Mobil Corp.

Montana, at 27 cents \nper gallon, is highest. \n \n  Georgians also benefit from their proximity to a major pipeline that carries \npetroleum through Atlanta, said Dale Shuirman, motor fuel tax administrator at \nGeorgia's Department of Revenue. \n \n  \"The longer you have to haul the product, the more transport costs you get in \nthere,\" said Shuirman, who plans to \"buy as much fuel in Georgia as I can\" for \nhis 750-mile round trip this week to Raleigh, N.C., to visit his son. \n \n  For many of those who couldn't drive, flying was a slightly fearsome \nproposition, according to a handful of travelers interviewed at Hartsfield \nAtlanta International Airport, the nation's busiest air hub. \n \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 21, 2001 00:14 ET (05:14 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243543Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.243549Z", "inner_id": 232, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5601, "annotations": [{"id": 4481, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "zLHUkzUurq", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282815Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282820Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 121.329, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "5ef0ad56-3041-46f4-ad54-435cc037635e", "import_id": 341, "last_action": null, "task": 5601, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DJ Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index &amp; AIG Daily Commentary\n\n \n \n \nThe Dow Jones - AIG Commodity Index  (SM) \n \n                            11/16/01  11/19/01    Change    MTD  YTD \n \nDJ-AIG Commodity Index        89.473    89.561    0.1%    -1%    -22% \nDJ-AIGCI Total Return        149.244   149.413    0.1%    -1%    -19% \n \nDJ-AIG Energy                125.150   126.434      1%    -13%   -40% \nDJ-AIG Petroleum             111.288   111.759    0.4%    -13%   -29% \nDJ-AIG Livestock              71.966    72.630    0.9%    -3%   -7% \nDJ-AIG Grains                 47.084    47.242    0.3%     2%   -16% \nDJ-AIG Industrial Metals      60.567    60.133   -0.7%     10%   -19% \nDJ-AIG Precious Metals        50.660    50.273   -0.8%     -3%   -7% \nDJ-AIG Softs                  64.606    64.124   -0.7%     15%   -21% \n \nAIG International Inc.

The plan has opponents, though, including Brazilian Finance Minister \nPedro Malan, and IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler recommended a cautious \napproach. \n \n  The IMF did say it stands ready to provide additional financial assistance to \ndeveloping countries during the current economic downturn. \n \n  But there was no indication that Argentina, teetering on the edge of default, \nwould be getting any more bailouts from the official sector anytime soon. \nInstead, the recession-wracked country was encouraged to continue seeking a \ndebt restructuring accord with private sector creditors, who hold $95 billion \nin bonds. \n \n  The three-day gathering drew a small but sometimes raucous group of \nantiglobalization protesters. The protests were not nearly as violent or \ndisruptive as those at other global meetings, however, and had no impact on the \nproceedings. \n \n  G20 and IMF leaders emphasized the pledge to crack down on terrorist \nfinancing as a key development from the session, one that mobilized the \nresources of all of the world's largest economies and some pivotal developing \ncountries. \n \n  \"It would have been understandable, at a time like this, (for countries) to \nhave turned inwards and focus on their domestic concerns. But I believe today's \nmeeting has been a reaffirmation of the importance of global cooperation,\" said \nGordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer for Britain and chairman of the IMF's \n International Monetary and Financial Committee. \n \n  The plans ask member nations to ratify the U.N. resolutions dealing with \nterrorist financing and adopt such measures as creating \"financial intelligence \nunits\" to monitor suspicious transactions and share information with other \nnations. \n \n  Although the G20 and IMFC plans both require member countries to provide \ntechnical and even financial assistance to other countries that need it, none \nof the officials were willing to attach a cost to the initiatives. \n \n  The IMF/World Bank meetings were originally scheduled for Washington in \nSeptember. The G20 session was moved from India because of security concerns in \nthe wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. \n \n  -By Don Curren and Mike Esterl, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2020; \ndon.curren@dowjones.com \n \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 18, 2001 18:59 ET (23:59 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247114Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247120Z", "inner_id": 235, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5604, "annotations": [{"id": 4484, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "jImWYHout2", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282900Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282905Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 186.031, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "d70ebe22-fccc-4baf-a990-0c9b371fc398", "import_id": 344, "last_action": null, "task": 5604, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(12/27) What&apos;s News, Business And Finance\n\n \n  From The Wall Street Journal \n \n  HOLIDAY SALES ROSE to better-than-expected levels at Wal-Mart, the country's \nbiggest retailer, and at its rival Target, helped by a surge in last-minute \nshopping over the weekend.

Wu \n \n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n \n  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Taiwan's oil market deregulation, which went into \neffect Wednesday, will hit the island's only two oil refiners, eroding their \nmarket shares next year, analysts say, but new players to the oil import \nbusiness will benefit from being able to import cheaper feedstocks. \n \n  Sales of oil products by Chinese Petroleum Corp. (Q.CPC) and Formosa \nPetrochemical Corp., which currently monopolize Taiwan's oil market, will fall \n20% next year as abundant supply amid dented demand and prices further prompt \nprice wars in the business, analysts say. \n \n  But deregulation should give a boost to the bottom lines of companies ready \nto venture into the oil import business, such as normal paraffin maker Ho Tung \nChemical Corp. (Q.HOC) and oil container and warehouse operator Pan Overseas \nCorp. (Q.PO). \n \n  Ho Tung's earnings per share could rise to NT$2 next year from around NT$1.40 \nthis year as it imports cheaper kerosene, an upstream raw material for use in \nproducing normal paraffin, a detergent chemical. That means in the first half \nof 2002, Ho Tung's share price could climb to NT$25, from Wednesday's close of \nNT$19.50, said Julian Chen, an analyst at National Securities in Taipei. \n \n  In anticipation of more oil imports into Taiwan, Pan Overseas could enjoy \nincreased business as foreign oil importers need somewhere to store their \nproducts, analysts note. The company's stock, which ended Wednesday's session \nat NT$9.10, has an upside of nearly NT$11, Chen said. \n \n  According to the Petroleum Management Law passed by the Legislative Yuan in \nSeptember, the government will allow non-oil companies with storage facilities \nable to store oil for consumption for 60 days, or registered oil sales of \n50,000 kiloliters in the last 12 months, to engage in the oil import business \nbeginning Jan. 1 next year. \n \n  The deregulation of oil product imports is partly aimed at increasing \ncompetition in the mostly state-dominated domestic oil market. Taiwan began \nallowing non-state oil companies to import fuels other than gasoline and diesel \nin January 1999. \n \n  An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said the government doesn't \nexpect the new law to spur a building spree of oil storage facilities in the \nshort term, because investment in such an area is subject to approval from \nlocal governments regarding land use and environmental protection concerns. \n \n  \"Building such facilities involves complicated approval procedures,\" he said. \n \n \n       CPC Won't Reduce Refinery Runs \n \n \n  Still, the likelihood of reduced sales of oil products on the heels of \nderegulation doesn't mean Taiwan's largest oil refiner CPC will reduce \noperations or cut its oil throughput next year. \n \n  \"We will maintain our operation at 80-90% next year and there are no plans to \nreduce production,\" a CPC spokesman said, adding that the company is \nconsidering exporting oil to China. \n \n  With Taiwan's economy expected to show a mild recovery in 2002 from an \nexpected first-ever annual contraction this year, analysts say demand for oil \nproducts will likely underpace supply. \n \n  Indeed, the domestic supply of diesel already outstrips demand by around \n20-30%, said Chen at National Securities. \n \n  He pointed out that the 2,000 or so gas station outlets dotting Taiwan now \nshould shrink by one-fourth in two years as price wars force closures. \n \n  In the next six to 12 months, foreign oil imports are expected to seize about \n10%-15% of the domestic oil market share, said Michael Wang, an analyst at \nPolaris Investment Advisory Co. in Taipei. \n \n  The CPC spokesman said the oil refiner is seeking to export part of the \nsurplus across the Taiwan Strait to the mainland, starting next year, as one \nway to ease pressure on sales as a result of competition from independent \nplayers. But such cross-strait trade is subject to government approval, he \nadded. \n \n  CPC currently has about 70% of the domestic market share while Formosa \nPetrochemical, Taiwan's only private oil refiner, has the other 30%. Formosa \nPetrochemical will see its market share cut by about 5% after deregulation, \nWang said. \n \n  Taiwan consumes about 10 million kiloliters of gasoline and 6 million \nkiloliters of diesel a year. The consumption rate has been growing at an annual \naverage 3%, according to an official with Taiwan's Energy Commission. \n \n          New Market Players \n \n \n  Among the expected gainers post-deregulation are Ho Tung Chemical and Pan \nOverseas, which both meet the government standard for importing oil. \n \n  The two companies are expected to take a combined 20% of market share next \nyear following deregulation, the official with Taiwan's Energy Commission said. \n \n  Ho Tung also owns oil storage tanks with capacity of 220,000 kiloliters in \nTaichung, central Taiwan. \n \n  Pan Overseas, which owns 30% in Taiwan Esso Petroleum Global Co., has \ninvested NT$1.4 billion to build seven oil tanks in Taichung with total \ncapacity of 215,000 kiloliters. The company has completed construction on five \nof the seven oil tanks. \n \n  Gas station chain operator National Petroleum Co. (Q.NPU), meanwhile, may \nhave also a chance to import cheaper oil products, though it already is in a \nstrategic alliance with Formosa Petrochemical, said National Securities' Chen. \n \n  However, the Energy Commission official said the Taiwan government hasn't \nreceived any applications from the two companies for oil import licenses. \n \n  -By Xu Yihe, Dow Jones Newswires; 65-415-4068; yi-he.xu@dowjones.com \n \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 26, 2001 03:00 ET (08:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247189Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247195Z", "inner_id": 237, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5606, "annotations": [{"id": 4486, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "SwsoEeW_7K", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282956Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282962Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 1150.012, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "2932c0d2-768f-4c94-863b-0fa7caa09a0e", "import_id": 346, "last_action": null, "task": 5606, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "BARRON&apos;S: Current Yield\n\n \n  Fed Ready To Ease Again, Even Absent Enron Fallout \n  By Jennifer Ablan \n \n  The swan dive by Enron, the fallen-angel energy trader, will likely continue \nto reverberate through the credit markets this week and next, increasing the \nlikelihood that the Federal Open Market Committee will cut short-term rates for \nthe 11th time when it meets December 11. \n \n  The December federal-funds contract implied a 93% chance that the FOMC would \ntrim its federal-funds target, currently at a 40-year low of 2%, by 25 basis \npoints (one-quarter of a percentage point) and a 46% likelihood of a \n50-basis-point reduction -- twice the odds the futures market was giving a week \nearlier. \n \n  Comments that two voting FOMC members made prior to the Enron collapse made \nclear that another easing is on the table. On Tuesday, Fed board member \nLaurence Meyer said the central bank shouldn't be deterred from further rate \ncuts simply because rates have already been pushed to such low levels. The same \nday William Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed, added that \"the only \nstopping place is zero, and if going to zero is constructive, then we ought to \ndo it.\" The remarks came on the heels of Monday's confirmation by the National \nBureau of Economic Research that the U.S. economy entered a recession in March. \n \n  While the financial markets discounted the official recession designation as \nold news, the statements by Meyer and Poole helped spur a sharp rally in \nTreasuries at midweek. Adding to the surge was news Thursday of a \nsharper-than-expected jump in the latest week's unemployment claims. The yield \non the benchmark 10-year note plunged to 4.764% from Wednesday's close of \n4.948% -- the biggest daily decline since January, according to Salomon Smith \nBarney. \"I've never seen intraday volatility like this,\" notes Michael \nSchumacher, head of interest-rate product strategy at that firm.The 10-year \nnote closed the week at a yield of 4.73% Friday, down from 5% a week earlier. \n \n  The November employment data, slated to be released Friday, should confirm \nthat the labor market continues to deteriorate, he says. The consensus forecast \ncalls for a 200,000 decline in nonfarm payrolls and a rise in the jobless rate \nto 5.6% from 5.4% in October. \n \n  Schumacher also notes that the two-year Treasury, the maturity most sensitive \nto Fed moves, has seen its yield soar to 2.83% from its bottom of 2.30%, \"and \nyet the economy hasn't shown any signs of bouncing back yet.\" The equity \nmarket, for its part, points to a recovery with an 18% jump in the S&P 500 from \nits September 21 low. \n \n  \"I think this would be more important\" [than the collapse of Long-Term \nCapital Management three years ago], Larry Jeddeloh, chief investment officer \nof the TIS Group, which produces the Market Intelligence Report, says of the \nEnron fiasco. \n \n  \"That is likely why a bankruptcy filing is being delayed, and why there will \nbe a ripple effect,\" he writes. \"The world over, a credit implosion is \nunfolding, in slow motion. Sabena Group, Swiss Air, two Japanese companies on \nWednesday, Bethlehem Steel, Polaroid and now Enron have all folded or are \nfolding in just the last 90 days. This matters.\" \n \n  Tom Gallagher, political economist at the ISI Group, adds: \"There's certainly \nno systemic risk that would call for Fed intervention. But having said that, \nthe discount window must be available for banks that have loans to Enron.\" \nMoreover, the Fed is furiously pumping liquidity into the financial system. The \nISI Group points out that the surge in money supply is looking a lot like a \n\"Y2K liquidity repeat.\" \n \n  Credit conditions haven't entirely deteriorated. Ratings of six U.S. banks -- \nincluding Citigroup, FleetBoston and Union Planters -- have been upgraded since \nthe start of the fourth quarter, according to Moody's Investors Service. \"Core \nearnings have thus far remained strong enough to offset an increase in problem \nloans,\" it says. \n \n  But total U.S. rating downgrades thus far in the quarter have topped upgrades \nby 85 to 40. Among financial institutions, however, 14 upgrades have \ncomfortably exceeded three downgrades, only one of which was linked to \nasset-quality deterioration. \n \n  Nonetheless, the Enron issue has made the markets nervous because of the lack \nof transparency about credits. \n \n  \"There could be something out there that certain people know because they \nwere over the wall . . . bankers or companies,\" says Glenn Reynolds, chief \nexecutive officer at CreditSights. \n \n  \"We don't know the scope of the counterparty-risk issues and what exactly are \nthe legal structures on those counterparty exposures, things like swaps and \nforex and plain vanilla,\" he continues. \"But what else is going on with the \ncreative structured deals that they have not fully disclosed, such as the \nderivative issues?\" \n \n  With $13 billion in debt and, according to The Wall Street Journal, up to $17 \nbillion in derivatives contracts, says Reynolds, \"we clearly haven't seen the \nlast of the Enron hits taken by the banking sector and by energy traders.\" \n \n  Already, the hits have been crushing. Enron's 6 3/4% unsecured debt due 2004 \nwas quoted at 20 bid, 24 asked Thursday, down from bid 47 on Monday. The debt \nwas quoted 83-85 on November 9, when Dynegy announced its merger agreement with \nEnron, then rated high-quality investment grade before falling to high-yield \n\"junk\" status on Wednesday. \n \n  Enron's bank debt has been spiraling in similar fashion. Its unsecured bank \ndebt, ranked on par with the bonds, is quoted at 19-19 1/2, while the secured \nbank debt is not trading actively. \"It's almost impossible to find a fall like \nthis for a leading industry benchmark like Enron,\" Reynolds says. \n \n  So-called vulture investors, which specialize in buying distressed debt, have \nbeen flocking to the debt of Enron. If a company undergoes restructuring or \nbankruptcy, holders of the bank debt or the claims stemming from the bank loans \nthat finance the company get paid first on whatever money the company has. If \nthere's any money left after that, holders of the company's bonds are next in \nline. Equity holders stand at the end of the queue. \n \n  Vulture investors buy big stakes in the debt of bankrupt or ailing companies, \nwhich gives them leverage during a reorganization. Their debt securities may be \nconverted to equity, which can yield juicy profits when a restructured company \nemerges from bankruptcy. \n \n  In the past year, many companies have seen prices on their bonds plunge long \nbefore bankruptcy or default seemed imminent. That's created a ballooning \nsupply of distressed debt, generally defined as bonds with yields 1,000 basis \npoints or more above comparable Treasuries. \n \n  CreditSights estimates the distressed-debt universe at about $250 billion, \nwhich includes bonds in default plus bonds trading with a yield-to-maturity of \ngreater than 20%. \"You are going to see a lot of investors involved in Enron \nand they will retain counsel looking at legal structure; looking at \nresidual-value estimates; evaluate time to clear bankruptcy, what the legal \nrights to different classes of creditors are,\" says Reynolds. \"This is the \nmother of all vulture research projects.\" \n \n  The risk-reward symmetry -- what the assets of Enron are worth versus how \nmuch capital vultures will pay -- is compelling enough to attract vultures, and \n\"this is what they live for,\" he adds. \n \n  Third Avenue Funds' Marty Whitman, one the biggest vulture investors in the \nmarket, says at some point he will buy the debt of Enron. \"I don't have to \nunderstand too much if I am a secured lender, but there doesn't seem to be much \nanywhere around here,\" he says. \"I don't think we will have that much of a \nproblem appraising the assets, but getting our arms around what the liabilities \nare, all of this off-balance-sheet stuff, will be difficult.\" \n \n  The financial markets certainly seem to agree. \n \n  --- \n \n  E-mail: jennifer.ablan@barrons.com. \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 01, 2001 00:15 ET (05:15 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247233Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247238Z", "inner_id": 238, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5607, "annotations": [{"id": 4487, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "XLLa8UBCXS", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282984Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.282989Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 92.065, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "bb0281dd-4025-499d-ab91-8ab5fd3d0e1d", "import_id": 347, "last_action": null, "task": 5607, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DJ Welteke: Productivity, Not CPI, Key For Wage Talks -Press\n\n \n \n \n  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Negotiators in Germany's coming round of wage talks \nshould take productivity as a guidepost but shouldn't consider inflation \ncompensation, as the European Central Bank will keep prices stable, Bundesbank \nPresident Ernst Welteke told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. \n \n  \"Wage negotiators can be certain that (the European Central Bank) will keep \nprices stable,\" said Welteke, who is a member of the ECB's governing council. \n\"Therefore, (wage negotiators) would be well advised to come to agreements \naround productivity and not to push for an inflation compensation.\" \n \n  An advance copy of the interview, to be published Saturday, was available \nFriday. \n \n  In addition, the paper quoted Welteke saying that \"wage agreements should be \ndesigned so as to help unemployed people become people with jobs.\" \n \n  IG Metall, the labor union that represents 3.6 million workers in Germany's \nmetals and electronics industries, will announce Monday its recommendations for \nthe regional wage talks.

Late Thursday, the euro was trading at PLN3.8995, from PLN3.8870 late Wednesday. The dollar was at PLN3.0050, from PLN2.9910. Trading was quiet, with most investors apparently done for the week ahead of the rate decision, which will be accompanied by the first commentary from the bank's new Governor Slawomir Skrzypek. \n\n \n\n  THE HUNGARIAN FORINT: Dresdner Kleinwort sees the Hungarian central bank cutting interest rates later in 2007, but says that risk is on the side of hikes before then. While the prospect of rates remaining higher for longer should ultimately prove forint-supportive, there is a risk of forint weakness in the near term, the bank says. \n\n  The forint weakened against the euro Thursday, despite a firm start. A trader said that Fitch's rating of Hungary's eurobond helped to support the forint early in the day. Rating agency Fitch late Wednesday assigned Hungary's EUR1 billion, 10-year eurobond a 'BBB+' rating. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at HUF254.85, from HUF253.35 early Thursday and from HUF254.30 late Wednesday. The euro came close to breaking through resistance at HUF255 Wednesday. \n\n \n\n  THE CZECH KORUNA: Traders see the euro continuing to rebound against the region's currencies Friday, following losses earlier in the week. \n\n  The koruna weakened a tad against the euro Thursday, in line with currencies across the region. There was little reaction to the Czech National Bank monetary policy board's decision Thursday to leave interest rate unchanged, in line with market expectations. Analysts expected the bank to keep its monetary policy on hold amid tame inflationary pressure.    In December, the country's annual inflation rate was 1.7%, up from 1.5% in November. The central bank's key two-week repurchase rate stands at 2.50%. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at CZK28.160, from CZK28.110 late Wednesday. \n\n \nFIXED INCOME \n \n\n  POLISH BONDS: Focus is on the central bank's interest rate meeting next week, with investors unlikely to take new positions ahead of this. \"We expect market players to wait for next week's rate-setting meeting and the new inflation projection of the central bank,\" says Calyon Bank. \n\n  Polish government bond prices were little changed Thursday, after a volatile, low-volume session. Bond prices strengthened early in the day, boosted by a firmer zloty and by weaker-than-expected German Ifo data. German business confidence fell unexpectedly in January, with companies' assessment of their current environment less positive than in December, the Munich-based Ifo research institute said. \n\n  By midday, Polish bond prices had recovered most of the losses posted over the previous two sessions, with yields falling across the curve. But by the end of the day, prices moved back, with yields towards the short end of the curve ending unchanged from late Wednesday. \n\n  Late Thursday, the average yield on the two-year bond was unchanged at 4.41% late Wednesday. The five-year bond yield was also unchanged, at 4.85%, while the 10-year yield was at 5.16%, from 5.14%. \n\n \n\n  HUNGARIAN BONDS: Volumes are set to remain thin and trading uneventful Friday, a trader says. \n\n  Lehman Brothers says the continued slowdown in Hungarian retail sales growth - demonstrated by data released Wednesday - is encouraging, suggesting that the government's fiscal measures have started to erode consumer demand. This should also be reassuring for the central bank, which is concerned about potential second-round effects of the expected surge in inflation, the bank adds. \n\n  Hungarian adjusted annual retail sales growth continued to slow in November due to lower demand for both food and nonfood products. \n\n  Regarding the upcoming appointment of a new central bank governor, Lehman Brothers believes Hungary's Andras Simor could be politically more acceptable than former central bank head Gyorgy Suranyi, who is also seen as a candidate. \n\n  Speculation continues about when the appointment will be made. The prime minister will announce the new governor after the ruling Socialist Party's congress Feb. 24-25, national daily Magyar Nemzet reported Thursday. \n\n  Hungarian government bond prices firmed Thursday, despite a weakening of the forint in late trade. Yields dropped across the curve. Late Thursday, the three-year bond yield was at 7.80%, from 7.92% late Wednesday. The five-year bond yield was at 7.50%, from 7.53%, while the 10-year yield was at 7.00%, from 7.07%. \n\n \n\n  CZECH BONDS: The market is likely to take a breather Friday, following volatile trading Thursday, says Ceska Sporitelna trader Petr Kaspar. \"In all I think there's now room for a little correction (in price terms),\" said Kaspar. \n\n  Czech government bond prices weakened Thursday, after spending much of the session seesawing either side of flat.

TVN ended down 5.6%, while Prokom was down 4.8%, Bioton down 3.4%, BZWBK down 2.9% and BRE down 3.8%. Bucking the trend, KGHM ended up 2.2% in a rebound from recent losses. \n\n \n\n  IN BUDAPEST: Traders are downbeat about the Hungarian pharmaceutical sector after drugmaker Egis issued a profit warning Thursday. Egis blamed slack sales in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States for lower-than-forecast first-quarter profit. \n\n  Fellow Hungarian drugmaker Richter said Thursday that it sees no need to adjust its earnings projections for this year. \n\n  But Raiffeisen trader Akos Herczenik says: \"Bad news is coming from Russia and the CIS, exactly where Richter expects its largest growth potential to come from.\" \n\n  The strengthening forint will also bite into Richter's financial results, he adds. \n\n  A second trader called the profit warning \"very brutal\" and said there was \"raging pessimism\" regarding pharmaceuticals in the wake of the warning. Another trader said that the selling pressure could persist for days as both pharmaceutical stocks are rather illiquid. \n\n  The BUX index ended down 0.6% at 24066.03 Thursday as Egis and Richter fell in the wake of the warning. Volumes were high. \"The Egis announcement was the only negative news today but it set the tone for the entire market,\" the trader said. Egis ended down 2.4%, while Richter was down 2.6%. At this price, Egis shares are attractive, says Wood & Co. MOL weathered the day well, ending up 1.4% on the back of rebounding oil prices. \n\n  One trader said he expects the BUX index to continue falling Friday as \"MOL alone won't be able to turn the entire market around,\" with further heavy selling possible over the next two weeks. OTP ended down 2.3% as weakening regional currencies put pressure on the banking sector. \n\n \n\n  IN PRAGUE: With no significant scheduled domestic news Friday, the PX index is expected to track movements on core international stock exchanges. A correction is possible Friday, if U.S. stock markets weaken, traders say. \n\n  The PX index ended up 0.9% at 1675.4 Thursday. CEZ was the most heavily-traded gainer, ending up 1.1%. Among other gainers, CETV ended up 1.3%, Erste Bank up 1.3% and Telefonica up 2.1%. Gains were driven by a steady bullish mood, a trader said. Zentiva was the most heavily-traded faller, ending down 0.6%, as investors sold the region's drug stocks amid Egis-prompted concerns about slowing sales growth of generic drugs in Russia, where most regional drug makers used to enjoy solid gains. Other losers included Komercni Banka, down 0.6%, and Philip Morris, down 3.2%. ECM and Pegas, the index's newest members, both ended lower, down 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in very thin trade. \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 26, 2007 00:52 ET (05:52 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247370Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-06T11:02:43.039691Z", "inner_id": 242, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5611, "annotations": [{"id": 5526, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "fiDvMdbRSt", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:27:42.475198Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:27:42.475224Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 79.082, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "741d33d8-5e91-4985-8d2d-64d451f51322", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5611, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DATA VIEW: Korean Current Acct Surplus Falls, Outlook Gloomy\n\n \n       By Jung-Ah Lee \n       Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  SEOUL (Dow Jones)--South Korea's current-account surplus narrowed sharply in December and in 2006 as higher prices for oil and other commodities pushed up the value of imports and as more Koreans traveled overseas. \n\n  The Bank of Korea said it expects the current account to deteriorate further in 2007 to its weakest point in 10 years. \n\n  Economists say the deteriorating performance adds to other recent weak economic indicators, which will encourage the central bank to keep policy steady and not tighten despite its concern about a property sector bubble. Indeed, housing prices seem to be stabilizing in the wake of the government's recent measures to cool the property sector. \n\n  The current account surplus narrowed sharply to a seasonally adjusted $600.5 million in December from $2.46 billion in November. That meant that the surplus for 2006 totaled just $6.09 billion, less than half the revised $14.98 billion surplus in 2005, the central bank said Wednesday. \n\n  In unadjusted terms, the surplus fell to $146.7 million from $4.24 billion in November. \n\n  The Bank of Korea predicts the current account surplus will narrow further to just $2 billion in 2007 as the service account deficit is likely to widen. The service account includes foreign travel, shipping costs and companies' overseas businesses. \n\n  Economists agree with the central bank's forecast. \n\n  \"Export (growth) is likely to decrease to a single-digit this year, while the service account deficit won't likely improve in one or two years time as the stronger local currency will further encourage Koreans to travel overseas,\" said Lee Sung-Kwon, an economist at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. \n\n  Lee expects that the dollar will continue to weaken against the won, exacerbating these trends. He forecasts the dollar will average KRW938 in 2007 after averaging KRW955.1 last year. At 0230 GMT, the dollar was quoted at KRW942.05. \n\n  Korean financial markets weren't much moved by the data, which was in line with expectations. \n\n  The dollar was only down slightly from KRW942.50 Tuesday, while the yield on benchmark five-year treasury bonds was last at 5.01% compared with 5.05% yesterday. \n\n  \"The (sharply lower) current account balance could have a psychological effect, but its impact should be only marginal as such a deterioration has been widely anticipated\" due to the nation's already widening service deficit, said a trader at a local bank. \n\n  The service account deficit widened to $18.76 billion last year - the biggest services deficit ever recorded - from $13.66 billion the previous year largely due to a rise in shipment costs and an increased number of Koreans traveling overseas. In December, the service account deficit widened to $1.88 billion from a revised $1.43 billion shortfall in November. \n\n  Despite a double-digit growth in exports, the goods trade surplus narrowed to $29.21 billion in 2006 from $32.68 billion in 2005, due to higher prices for raw materials, including oil. \n\n  Exports rose 14.5% to $325.7 billion last year. In December, exports climbed to $28.87 billion from $25.63 billion a year earlier. \n\n  Exports were largely led by strong demand for petroleum, machinery, steel and ships. \n\n  Imports increased 18.4% to $309.3 billion in 2006. In December, they rose to $27.50 billion from $24.19 billion a year earlier. \n\n  The income account deficit narrowed to $538.6 million last year, from a $1.56 billion deficit in 2005, due to an increased returns of overseas interest payments, the central bank said. The income account surplus widened slightly to $285.0 million last month from $236.3 million in November. \n\n  South Korea also saw $18.62 billion of capital flowing into the country in 2006, compared with a $4.76 billion capital inflow in 2005. \n\n  The capital account surplus for December rose sharply to $5.46 billion from $436 million in November. \n\n \n\n  -By Jung-Ah Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 822-732-2165; jung-ah.lee@dowjones.com \n\n  -Edited by Iain McDonald \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 30, 2007 21:51 ET (02:51 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247404Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:27:42.682052Z", "inner_id": 243, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5612, "annotations": [{"id": 5527, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "nbi4qCQyi7", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:29:31.947991Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:29:31.948026Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 108.519, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "73a0b42f-b8ba-42b6-92e1-7cdde90886d6", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5612, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "SURVEY: Brazil Seen Cutting Key Interest Rate 25bp Wed\n\n \nSelic rate history (annual percent): \n Nov     Oct     Aug    July     May     Apr    Mar  Jan/06 \n13.25   13.75   14.25   14.75   15.25   15.75  16.50  17.25 \n \n\n  Gerald Jeffris \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  BRASILIA (Dow Jones)--Amid concerns over a creeping acceleration of inflation and signs of a warming economy, Brazil's central bank is expected to slow the pace of interest rate easing at its monetary policy meeting Wednesday, a Dow Jones Newswires survey showed. \n\n  Among forecasts from analysts at 18 financial institutions, 12 said the bank would cut the reference Selic rate a quarter percentage point, while six saw a half-point rate cut. \n\n  \"Even though there's a general perception that inflation will remain under target this year, price pressure in the first quarter favors a more moderate stance by the central bank,\" noted Newton Rosa, economist at SulAmerica Investimentos in Sao Paulo. \n\n  With a cut, the Selic would reach its lowest level since the bank established its Copom monetary policy committee in June 1996. \n\n  The bank has reduced the rate by 6.5 percentage points since September 2005 to a current 13.25% annually, with 10 half-point cuts and two cuts of three-quarters of a point each. \n\n  Speculation over a shift to a slower pace of easing gained strength in November, however, after the central bank's rate policy committee split in its decision, with three of eight members voting to cut the Selic rate by only a quarter point. \n\n  Since that time, further indicators have suggested continued cause for caution. \n\n  While Brazil easily met its inflation target in 2006, posting an annual rate of 3.14%, monthly IPCA consumer price inflation rose to 0.48% in December from 0.31% the previous month, coming in slightly ahead of market estimates. Additionally, core inflation rose during the month to about 0.4% from around 0.25% the previous month. \n\n  Rising domestic food, fuels, and transportation costs were seen as responsible for the price pressure, which some observers see possibly spilling into further data going forward. \n\n  The short-term increase, meanwhile, caused analysts to revise inflation projections upward for the coming 12 months. \n\n  According to the central bank's latest market surveys, the IPCA index is seen rising in 2007 to 4.07%. The government has set targets for IPCA consumer price inflation at 4.5% this year and next. \n\n  Additionally, Brazil's industrial production rose by 0.8% in November, far surpassing market expectations and suggesting the economy could be seeing the first signs of heating due the central bank's long string of interest rate cuts. \n\n  Beyond those indicators, some analysts have also cited other domestic factors that could be taken into consideration at the rate meeting, including a wide ranging economic stimulus package that is scheduled for release this week. \n\n  \"The rate committee will likely reduce the rhythm of rate cuts now to evaluate during the coming month what impact the package will have on the economy,\" said Walter Machado, President of Brazilian Institute of Financial Executives in Sao Paulo. \n\n  Still, for other observers it remains unclear to what point the central bank will allow concerns over recent inflation to influence its rate decision amid pressure for accelerated economic growth and favorable factors on other fronts, including falling international oil prices. \n\n  \"With expectations of declining inflation, low sovereign risk, low oil prices, low GDP growth, high investment growth and a higher interest rate than the international financial arbitrage rate, it is difficult to justify a smaller reduction of the Selic at the Copom meeting,\" argued Jose Marcio Camargo analyst at the Sao Paulo based Tendencias consultancy in a recent research note. \n\n  Following his re-election to a second four-year term in office in October, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for a target to increase Brazil's economic growth by 5% annually. \n\n  Brazil posted annual economic growth of 3.2% in the third quarter of 2006. \n\n  Meanwhile, according to the central bank's latest market surveys, economic growth likely ended 2006 around 2.7% and is seen expanding to 3.50% in 2007. \n\n   The same surveys show the Selic rate falling to about 11.75% annually by the end of 2007. \n\n  -By Gerald Jeffris, Dow Jones Newswires; (5561) 4501-7143, geraldjeffrisdowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 19, 2007 15:34 ET (20:34 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247438Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:29:32.144872Z", "inner_id": 244, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5613, "annotations": [{"id": 5528, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "NtHAHJarrr", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-27T19:31:10.354305Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:31:18.891085Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 102.735, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f05a88f4-a30c-4069-9e9a-f92fd039a6f9", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5613, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "RATE FUTURES REPORT: Expectations Steady As Data Awaited\n\n \n    By Jesse Thomas \n    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--For the first time in more than a week, interest rate futures prices Tuesday didn't settle lower, breaking a trend of the market reducing its expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate this year. \n\n  However, despite a weak data report released Tuesday, Eurodollar futures prices settled mostly flat, a signal that market participants are showing little conviction in pushing prices higher ahead of inflation data reports and speeches from Fed officials due later in the week. \n\n  \"The market, right now, has no interest in rallying,\" said Howard Gussis, an independent Eurodollar floor broker. \n\n  A report from the New York Federal Reserve on the area's manufacturing activity provided support throughout Tuesday's session to Eurodollar futures, which had settled lower on Friday for the sixth-straight session. \n\n  The New York Fed's Manufacturing Index dropped to a reading of 9.13 in January, compared with a revised 22.19 in December. The consensus among 11 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a January reading of 20.00. \n\n  Immediately following the report, Eurodollar futures prices climbed, indicating increased market expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. Yet, prices struggled to post gains by the end of the session. \n\n  \"There's just not a strong conviction that this market's going to go higher,\" said a market source in the Eurodollar options pit, adding that when prices do move up, \"traders are quick to take profits,\" which sends prices lower. \n\n  \"The bigger question is the inflation numbers starting tomorrow,\" he said. \n\n  The Labor Department is due to release the December producer price index at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) on Wednesday, followed by the December consumer price index at 8:30 a.m. EST on Thursday. \n\n  Both reports are watched closely by the Federal Reserve and seen as key measures of inflation. Market participants agree that the two reports - known as PPI and CPI - could sway the market, in either direction, with more authority than was seen Tuesday. \n\n  Also Thursday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify on the fiscal and economic outlook before the Senate Budget Committee in Washington. \n\n  Gussis put it simply, saying, \"Bernanke's always big.\" \n\n  The downward price trend throughout last week in Eurodollar futures was a result of comments from Federal Reserve officials who cited inflation as their primary concern, along with data reports that suggested economic strength. \n\n  At Tuesday's close, the June Eurodollar contract priced in a 48% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee reduces its key target rate from 5.25% to 5% in the second quarter. Those odds are unchanged from Friday; markets were closed Monday. \n\n  For the third quarter, the September Eurodollar contract at Tuesday's close showed a 92% probability for a 5% rate, also unchanged from Friday. The market fully expects 5% by year's end, along with a 40% odds for 4.75%. The FOMC has held the rate at 5.25% at its last four policy-setting meetings. \n\n  Eurodollar futures, traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are commonly used by traders to bet on short-term U.S. interest rate expectations, although they are actually linked to three-month projections for the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. \n\n  For longer-dated contracts, Treasury futures tied to longer-maturity bonds at the Chicago Board of Trade saw moderate price gains in Tuesday's session as contracts lifted off their 2-1/2 month lows seen at Friday's close. \n\n \n   CONTRACT            PRICE           CHANGE \n \n   Mar  Eurodollars    94.65         Unchanged \n   June Eurodollars    94.72         Unchanged \n   Sep  Eurodollars    94.83         Unchanged \n   Dec  Eurodollars    94.95         Up 1 basis point * \n   Feb  Fed Funds      94.76         Unchanged \n   Mar  10-Year Notes  107-07+       Up 4/32 \n   Mar  30-Year Bonds  110-31        Up 5/32 \n \n\n  *A basis point is equivalent to 1/100th of a percentage point. \n\n \n\n  -By Jesse Thomas, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4117; Jesse.Thomas@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 16, 2007 15:38 ET (20:38 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247471Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-27T19:31:19.154737Z", "inner_id": 245, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5614, "annotations": [{"id": 5563, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "5Dx2_f88BD", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-28T23:34:58.792964Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-28T23:34:58.793001Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 92.72, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d9292c9b-76dd-4c85-bdd9-5ca0263f3a3d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5614, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJA(1/2) China&apos;s Oil Hunt Heats Up Abroad\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \n   By Shai Oster \n\n  BEIJING -- China's private entrepreneurs are joining its big companies in striking abroad to search for oil to satisfy their nation's insatiable thirst, in the latest sign of how the world's fastest-growing major economy is roiling energy markets. \n\n  Perhaps the most successful of this new breed of wealthy Chinese wildcatter is Ni Zhaoxing, a 50-year-old businessman who has spent the last year prospecting for oil in western Canada after amassing a fortune in China's real-estate market. Mr. Ni's ZhongRong Group has struck oil in its Saskatchewan field, a find that eventually could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue a year, based on his projections. \n\n  China has been encouraging its big state oil companies to go abroad for years, aware that domestic oil fields don't have enough supply to meet growing demand in China. Government-run companies including China National Petroleum Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. have bought oil and gas fields in Central Asia, Africa and the Americas. \n\n  That push -- often into countries such as Sudan or Iran that have troubled ties with the U.S. -- coupled with China's stated aim of improving its ability to use armed force abroad to protect its global interests, has raised alarms in Washington and other capitals. Western politicians and oil executives worry that Asia's state-owned oil companies are trying to lock up the world's resources in a bid to boost their nations' energy security. Some analysts counter that Chinese oil companies are actually spending only a fraction of what their western peers are in acquiring overseas oil fields. \n\n  Mr. Ni's efforts are incidental by the standards of those giants and their foreign Big Oil counterparts. But even in its early stages, the emergence of private-sector oil developers in China's state-dominated industry illustrates both the country's growing obsession with energy and the rise of its entrepreneurial class. It also shows how, amid today's high oil prices and tight supplies around the world, even small-time players with no experience or expertise believe the search for oil can be lucrative. \n\n  China has become more dependent on energy exports amid rapid industrialization and the rise of a middle class snapping up cars, as well as flat-lining production from its domestic oil fields. Its demand for oil is expected to reach 7.4 million barrels a day in 2007, up from 7 million barrels in 2006 and 35% ahead of the 5.5 million barrels in 2003. But its domestic supply this year is expected to be just 3.7 million barrels a day, only slightly more than the 3.4 million barrels a day it pumped out in 2003. \n\n  Private Chinese companies are looking well beyond Canada to fill the gap, to places such as Indonesia and Ecuador. In April, 40 such companies traveled to Pakistan and signed deals to develop oil fields, refineries, pipelines and coal mines worth a total of more than 10 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), according to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. \n\n  The highest profile member of that delegation was Gong Jialong, chairman of Great United Petroleum Holding Co., a consortium of several dozen private Chinese companies involved in small-scale oil production and refining. One of Great United's biggest shareholders is Guangcai 49 Holding Co., whose directors include Charles Zhang, chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Sohu.com Inc., one of China's biggest Internet companies. Mr. Zhang couldn't be reached for comment. \n\n  Mr. Gong also heads China's Chamber of Commerce for Petroleum Industry, a group of about 1,000 private oil companies that is lobbying for fewer government restrictions in China's heavily regulated domestic oil market. Mr. Gong's future was thrown into question by his detention last month on suspicion of unspecified economic crimes. His detention was disclosed by Tianfa Petroleum Co., a listed company he controls. \n\n  Another Chinese oil entrepreneur is Cui Xinsheng, chairman of the China International Petroleum Investment Union, a group that includes investors from China as well as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Singapore. The group has paid about $400 million for rights to four fields in Indonesia and two in the Middle East. It hopes to sell the rights to China's big state-owned companies, Mr. Cui says. \n\n  Mr. Ni started off running a small village-owned construction-materials factory near the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou in 1980. After early success with the factory, he moved to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, then an emerging economic hothouse where China's leaders were testing capitalism. Mr. Ni says he was repeatedly swindled by business partners in Shenzhen, losing almost all his money. \n\n  He persevered, though, setting his sights on the rough-and-tumble real-estate market with the founding of ZhongRong in 1992 -- just as China's property market was getting ready to take off. ZhongRong blossomed, too. Among its current projects are a 43-story building in Shanghai's financial district and a collection of 78 neoclassical villas in the mountains west of Beijing, called in a promotional brochure a \"royal Xanadu.\" \n\n  Mr. Ni now has a net worth estimated at $190 million. He says the assets controlled by ZhongRong, which he and his wife own, are valued at around $770 million. \n\n  Mr. Ni says he first got the idea to invest in energy during his early-morning newspaper reading. \"I saw there was a need,\" he says in an interview at ZhongRong's Beijing office, a restored former bank in the city's prerevolutionary diplomatic quarter. \"We have a responsibility to increase the world's resources, either by conserving energy or finding more,\" he says. \n\n  Despite China's obvious need for more oil, regulators at first balked at granting ZhongRong the permission necessary to convert the $30 million needed for its investment in Canada from Chinese yuan. ZhongRong eventually prevailed, and in 2005 began buying Saskatchewan tracts that eventually totaled 15,000 hectares. \n\n  Trevor Dark, assistant deputy minister of petroleum and natural gas at Saskatchewan Industry and Resources, says ZhongRong's subsidiary has licenses to drill six wells over a 12-month period in the Weyburn region. Canada Capital Energy Corp., the ZhongRong subsidiary set up for the project, says it has found oil in two wells so far, but has not said how much they are producing. The company says its goal is to reach a production rate of 20,000 barrels a day in five years. That would be valued at about $438 million a year at today's prices. \n\n  China's big oil companies haven't always been welcomed overseas. State-run Cnooc's bid to buy California-based Unocal in 2005 was defeated in part because of fears China was trying to lock up oil resources at America's expense, a charge Cnooc denied. \n\n  Mr. Ni's reception has been better. \"We're very pleased,\" says Mr. Dark. \"We're absolutely happy for more firms from China to invest in Saskatchewan.\" \n\n  Mr. Ni says China's growing oil demand has fueled the soaring prices that attracted him to the business. But he says his investment has nothing to do with China's political agenda, or an effort to secure resources for the motherland. \"I'm an investor,\" he says. \"Not just a Chinese investor. I'll sell the oil where I find it. \n\n  --- \n\n  Zhou Yang in Beijing and Norval Scott in Calgary contributed to this article. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 01, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247508Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-28T23:34:59.006303Z", "inner_id": 246, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5615, "annotations": [{"id": 5564, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "lCr_YC5O3z", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-01T17:55:59.911252Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T17:55:59.911277Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 243.505, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "99c10a26-3a3f-486e-b607-23fede40c55d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5615, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJA(2/12) Insurers Target Developing World\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \n   By Ian McDonald, Liam Pleven and Eric Bellman \n\n  JHALAWAR, India -- Last year, global insurance giant American International Group Inc. opened a garage-size office in this dusty town of about 50,000. Coming up soon here: a policy that insures a cow for a $10 annual premium. \n\n  Seeking potential sources of future growth, AIG and its international rivals are racing to sell insurance in the developing world, from sprawling markets like India and China to smaller ones like Romania and Nicaragua. In remote areas, insurers must teach the concept of insurance to populations who have never bought any. Sometimes, as in parts of northern Uganda, the local language doesn't even have a word for it. \n\n  To penetrate these markets, insurers are devising unusual policies, charging as little as 50 cents to insure everything from television sets to burial costs. They are forgoing conventional documentation requirements, sometimes selling life insurance to people who don't know when they were born. \n\n  Instead of relying entirely on agents, AIG and many others are partnering in some markets with nonprofit microloan programs, operations that lend small amounts of money to the poor. Many microlenders sell a form of life insurance that will pay off the loan and sometimes also compensate survivors if the debtor dies. AIG has roughly 2.25 million life-insurance policies on microloan recipients, mostly in Uganda, Mexico, India and Brazil. \n\n  Microlenders say selling insurance benefits borrowers by teaching them greater financial sophistication. It is a \"natural extension of our role,\" says Scott Graham, senior manager of strategic alliances for Washington-based Finca International, a nonprofit group that operates microlending programs in 21 countries. \n\n  Microlending won Bangladeshi banker Muhammad Yunus the Nobel Peace Prize last year. And just as big banks are being drawn to that business, big insurers are increasingly lured by what they call \"microinsurance.\" It is a way for insurers to wedge themselves into new markets -- markets they see as crucial to the future of the industry, which in 2005 collected $3.4 trillion in premiums. \n\n  That year, insurance premiums world-wide edged up 2.5% from the year before, according to Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world's largest reinsurer. That is because half the total market is driven by the U.S. and Japan, where insurance is ubiquitous and growth opportunities can be limited. \n\n  In that same year, insurance premiums in emerging markets rose nearly 7% after inflation, more than three times the growth rates of developed markets, according to Swiss Re. Increasing car and home ownership in those countries are boosting demand, as is rapid economic growth. \n\n  \"The premiums are not very high, but selling these policies allows you to build up relationships with these customers as their markets develop, and that's going to be important,\" says James Schiro, chief executive officer of Zurich Financial Services AG, which sells microinsurance in four Latin American countries today and is launching a pilot program in South Africa sometime this year. \n\n  Ugandan Fred Adriko, 20 years old, didn't know his mother had insurance until she was killed in a car accident in 2005. She had taken out a microloan from Finca to develop a business selling produce and purchased a policy at the same time. \n\n  Because of the policy, Mr. Adriko received a payment of about $650, which he can use to take care of his family, he said in an interview through a Finca-provided translator. \n\n  AIG knows the benefits of getting in early. Former AIG Chief Executive Maurice R. \"Hank\" Greenberg, hewing to the style and approach of his mentor Cornelius Vander Starr, started building relationships with government and business leaders in China more than a quarter century ago, before the government allowed foreign insurers to sell policies there. \n\n  Today, AIG is the only foreign insurer allowed to have a wholly owned unit sell life insurance in China, a right it won in 1992. Other foreign insurers are piling into the China market, but they typically need to work with a locally based partner. \n\n  Emerging markets can present logistical and cultural hurdles as well as daunting local bureaucracies. What is more, since the premiums collected are small by Western standards, the revenue generated by the microinsurance sector also is tiny. While developing markets are profitable for a few companies, insurance executives say they remain unprofitable for many others. \n\n  AIG, which does business in about 130 countries, says its microinsurance business is profitable, but total premiums from life insurance sold to microloan recipients in developing markets add up to only about $45 million a year. That is just 0.15% of the $29.4 billion in life insurance premiums AIG took in world-wide in 2005. \n\n  Some insurers are sitting out the global rush. Northwestern Mutual, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, company that is among the U.S.'s largest life insurers, doesn't sell insurance abroad. The company relies on agents who aim to establish long-term relationships with customers, explains CEO Ed Zore, and \"I don't think we could\" build such a sales force in another country. Mr. Zore says the company may expand to other countries in the future. \n\n  The insurance race is particularly heated in India, which opened its market to foreign insurers in 2000. Not only does the country boast a young population and a British-influenced legal system, but it also is relatively virgin territory. The country's 1.1 billion people spend $21 billion on premiums, a little more than what 13 million Illinois residents paid for property-casualty coverage in 2005, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a New York trade group. \n\n  A number of the world's biggest insurers, including AIG and Aviva PLC, Britain's largest insurer, expanded into India in the past seven years. Allianz SE, a German insurance giant, says it has 180,000 full and part-time agents in India and is hiring 10,000 more every month. Britain's Prudential PLC, India's leading foreign life insurer in 2005, arrived even before the market opened to establish local ties. \n\n  India also presents some obstacles. As in China, local players are dominant. The Life Insurance Corp. of India boasts more than one million agents and collected well more than 90% of the country's life-insurance premiums in 2005, according to the Insurance Information Institute. \n\n  Under India's laws, all foreign companies must partner with locally based companies to sell insurance. India also requires that companies generate some of their business from the countryside, preventing insurers from focusing solely on the affluent urban customers they are often most interested in. \n\n  India stipulates that 5% of foreign insurers' premiums for property-casualty coverage must be generated by rural customers. Rural customers must represent 7% of all life insurance policies in the insurer's first year, a number that rises to 18% in its fifth year. \n\n  In rural India, in addition to using their own agents, both AIG and Aviva typically sell basic life-insurance policies through local women's groups and microlending agencies. This lowers distribution costs because the person processing the loan also sells and processes the insurance policy on the loan. \n\n  Finca, which works with AIG in many places but not India, says its local offices keep as much as 25% to 50% of the premiums left over after claims and expenses in some areas. In others, Finca's local offices get nothing. \n\n  Some companies working in India say married women are often their best representatives because they tend to stay in their community and know it well. That knowledge is helpful given how much insurers have relaxed traditional standards, accepting thumb prints on policy applications and eliminating death-certificate requirements, since few rural clients die in hospitals. In India, AIG says it accepts the signatures of a village elder or groundskeeper at cremation facilities. \n\n  Without local expertise \"we would be too scared to go into this market,\" says Sriram Gopal, head of the rural, nonlife insurance business for the Tata AIG Life Insurance Co., which is AIG's local joint venture with Tata Group, an Indian conglomerate. \n\n  To market its brand in rural areas, Aviva representatives tour villages and stage festivals in a promotional van festooned with a big loudspeaker. \n\n  In Nandurdi village -- a few brick and mud homes amid sugar-cane and grape fields five hours' drive from Mumbai -- roughly 200 villagers gathered recently to spin a giant wheel in hopes of winning key chains and pens. As they handed out the prizes, Aviva agents talked to the crowd about the value of life insurance. \n\n  The reps told the crowd that Aviva is the world's fifth-largest insurer and assured them that insurance isn't just for the rich. They asked villagers who would take care of their family if they died. \n\n  \"Who here has insurance?\" asked Aviva representative Sushil Gaykawad, and only about six hands went up. \"Who plans to get insurance now?\" he followed up. All hands went up. \n\n  To reach its core urban audience, Aviva plasters its logo on the clocks that count down to green lights at traffic stops in Delhi. It advertises during televised cricket matches, and, in 2005, Aviva paid for more than 2,000 airings of TV advertisements for the Bollywood family drama, \"Viruddh.\" The movie ads ended with the India megastar, Amitabh Bachchan, saying the Aviva slogan: \"Kal Par Control,\" or \"Control Your Future.\" \n\n  After four years in India, Aviva covers more than one million lives and operates 113 branches, says Vivek Khanna, head of Aviva's Indian operations. \n\n  Rival AIG has already written policies covering the lives of about 15,000 cattle. While local insurers pioneered cow coverage years earlier, those policies became problematic because of fraudulent claims. To avoid bovine fraud, AIG employs retired veterinarians who, armed with digital cameras, visit farms to verify a cow's death. The policy typically pays more than $200 when the animal dies. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 11, 2007 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247549Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T17:56:00.136415Z", "inner_id": 247, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5616, "annotations": [{"id": 5565, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "zFQ0I8lOqa", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-01T17:59:08.395270Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T17:59:08.395295Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-01T17:56:59.128563Z", "lead_time": 187.499, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e57d398c-f996-4696-9af0-250a6ce3527b", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5616, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UPDATE: Euro-Zone Jan Services PMI 57.9 Vs 57.2 In Dec\n\n  (This updates an item that ran at 0900 GMT with new sourcing, additional detail and analysts' comments) \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The euro zone's services sector grew at the most rapid pace in six months in January, while private sector companies raised their prices more aggressively than at any time since November 2000, a survey of purchasing managers conducted by NTC Research showed Monday. \n\n  The headline measure of activity in the services sector - the purchasing managers index - rose to 57.9 in January from 57.2 in December.    The rise in the PMI was unexpected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires last week had forecast the PMI would decline to 56.7. A reading above 50.0 indicates a period of expansion for the sector, while a reading below 50.0 indicates a contraction. \n\n  The pickup in the services sector was broad-based, with activity strengthening in Germany, France and Italy. \n\n  However, a similar survey of purchasing managers published Thursday showed manufacturing activity slowed in January as exports were hit by the strong euro, so the composite PMI fell to 56.6 from 57.5. That indicates  the euro-zone economy continued to grow at a strong, but slightly slower pace as 2007 began. \n\n  The strength of the services sector relative to manufacturing also suggests that the composition of growth in the euro zone may be changing, with expansion becoming less reliant on exports and more reliant on domestic - including consumer - demand. \n\n  \"The euro's strength against the US dollar appears to have hit manufacturing exports, but this has been offset by faster growth in the service sector,\" said Ken Gaynor, head of economics at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which sponsors the survey. \"This suggests that 2007 may see a changing growth dynamic from that seen in 2006, away from exports towards improved domestic demand in the euro area's main national economies, particularly Germany.\" \n\n  Strengthening domestic demand makes the recovery less vulnerable to developments elsewhere in the global economy, for example a housing-led slowdown in the U.S. \n\n  But it may also mean that manufacturers and service providers feel more confident that they can raise prices without losing customers. \n\n  In January, private sector companies raised the prices they charge at the fastest rate since November 2000, when NTC first began compiling data on that component of the PMI. Although partly the result of an increase in Germany's sales tax rate, that is likely to cause concern at the European Central Bank, and increases the likelihood that the central bank will raise interest rates again in March, and possibly once more before the end of June. \n\n  \"The ECB will be concerned by the sharp rise in both the input prices and prices charged indices for the euro-zone service sector in January,\" said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. \"Reports of improved pricing power among service providers and higher wages will be particularly worrying for the ECB.\" \n\n  Private sector companies reported that they continued to hire new workers for the seventeenth straight month, a development that suggests the pickup in domestic demand should continue. \n\n  -By Paul Hannon; Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842 9491; paul.hannon@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 05, 2007 05:12 ET (10:12 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247589Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T17:59:08.630299Z", "inner_id": 248, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5617, "annotations": [{"id": 5566, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "eRA_8LvZEF", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-01T18:02:54.369907Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T18:02:54.369942Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-01T18:02:46.205540Z", "lead_time": 225.01, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f47d45d6-d451-40ae-9415-74a2f4779a41", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5617, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "G7 Aims To Curb Carry Trades, Stressing Risk Of Yen Gains\n\n \n\n  (This article was originally published Saturday) \n\n \n\n  By Paul Hannon \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  ESSEN, Germany (Dow Jones)--Finance ministers and central bankers from Europe and Japan Saturday launched a concerted effort to curb the growth of carry trades, which European officials believe have been a key factor in pushing the euro to record highs against the Japanese yen on the foreign exchange markets. \n\n  Carry trades refer to investments in assets denominated in high-yielding currencies that are funded by low-yielding currencies. With the Bank of Japan's key interest rate set at 0.25%, borrowed Japanese yen are nowa popularsource of cheap funding for those investments. \n\n  European expressions of concern about the yen's recent weakness and the role carry trades have played in pushing the euro higher against the Japanese currency fueled speculation in the foreign exchange markets that action would be taken at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven leading economies here. \n\n  The G7's final communique made no reference to the yen, but noted that Japan's recovery is \"on track and is expected to continue.\" G7 members said they \"are confident that the implications of these developments will be recognized by market participants and will be incorporated in their assessments of risks.\" \n\n  According to G7 officials briefing later, those statements were intended to draw investors' attention to the possibility that the yen will strengthen  and Japanese interest rates will rise as the recovery continues. That would threaten carry trades, since an appreciation of the Japanese currency would cut investors' profits. \n\n  In press briefings after their joint statement, some G7 finance ministers and central bankers highlighted those statements with coordinated language that made clear the yen-funded carry trade was their primary target. \n\n  \"We want markets to be aware of the risks in one-way bets in general,\" said European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. \"We, in particular, think of carry trades, but not only carry trades.\" \n\n  At exactly the same time, but in a different room, Germany's finance minister delivered a nearly-identical warning. \n\n  \"We want to strictly stick to one language,\" Peer Steinbrueck said. \"It's the common view of finance ministers and central bankers that markets should be aware of risks stemming from one-sided bets, particularly on foreign exchange markets. This addresses the problem linked in particular to carry trades.\" \n\n  Japanese Minister of Finance Koji Omi added his voice to the chorus. \n\n  \"Market participants ought to be aware that acting in one direction could bring a risk,\" he said, referring to some traders view that yen weakness is a sure bet. \n\n  Despite Steinbrueck's claim that all G7 members had signed up to the common phrasing, U.S. officials didn't speak about the danger of one-sided bets in general or carry trades in particular.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters that as a general rule he doesn't believe he should ever comment on the value of freely-floating currencies or evaluate particular trading strategies. \n\n  The success of efforts to curb the growth of carry trades may depend on how consistently officials stick to the agreed message. European officials felt that their Japanese counterparts departed from an agreed position shortly after the last G7 meeting in Singapore in September, undermining their initial success in talking the yen higher. \n\n  An official at a European G7 delegation insisted the lesson from that experience has been learned. \n\n  \"Believe me, everyone will stick to the current wording, all parties concerned are fully aware of the risks, notably the Bank of Japan,\" he said. \n\n  The mix of an oblique reference in the communique and more direct comments in press briefings may reflect the G7's desire to avoid an overly dramatic reaction in foreign exchange markets. A more direct statement on the yen's value or Japanese interest rates - unlikely in the face of Japanese opposition and U.S. disinterest - could have risked a rapid unwinding of carry trades, sending assets prices into a spin. \n\n  Despite the immediate focus on the yen in response to European concerns about a loss of competitiveness in markets in which Japanese exporters compete with their European counterparts, the Chinese yuan remained an ongoing concern for G7 members. \n\n  In their communique, they said that \"in emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur.\" \n\n  The G7 had previously called on China to allow the yuan greater flexibility to move in response to market forces. The more direct reference to movement in the exchange rate represents a departure from previous statements. \n\n  The G7 said it welcomed \"China's commitment to rebalance growth.\" \n\n  China's strong record of economic growth in recent years has been driven by an investment boom and exports, while G7 members want the government to encourage stronger consumer demand as part of a shared effort to reduce trade imbalances. \n\n  U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Tim Adams described the change in language as a \"technical fix.\" U.S. officials say their message to China hasn't changed, and they continue to believe China should allow the yuan to appreciate in the short term, and move to a freely-floating currency regime in the longer run. \n\n  However, European officials pointed out that while the yuan appreciated by 3.4% against the dollar last year, that was partly the result of the greenback's weakness. But the euro is now stronger relative to the yuan than it was when China ended its peg with the U.S. dollar in 2005, and linked its currency to a basket of currencies. In their view, the new stress on the \"effective exchange rate\" reflects the need for the yuan to strengthen against currencies other than the dollar. \n\n  The G7 sounded a generally upbeat note about the outlook for the world economy, noting that growth is more balanced. \n\n  \"The US economy is experiencing solid activity, while adjusting to a more sustainable growth path,\" the communique said. \"Canada and the UK remain on a strong and balanced growth path. The euro area is experiencing an increasingly broad-based upswing.\" \n\n  They noted that with energy prices falling, inflationary pressures are \"moderating,\" although G7 central bankers said they said they will \"remain vigilant.\" \n\n  -Paul Hannon, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 20 7842 9491, paul.hannon@dowjones.com \n\n  (Monica Houston-Waesch, Elizabeth Price, Geraldine Amiel, Andrea Thomas, Natsuo Nishio and Dennis McMahon contributed to this report) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 11, 2007 15:00 ET (20:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247627Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T18:02:54.590954Z", "inner_id": 249, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5618, "annotations": [{"id": 5567, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "AnxNy4X6-c", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-01T18:08:31.042084Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T18:08:31.042118Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 335.648, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a0b564fc-e3a2-460b-8c69-88a5b94af46e", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5618, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Signs Mount Of End Game For Zimbabwe&apos;s Robert Mugabe\n\n  JOHANNESBURG (AP)--Signs are mounting that Zimbabwe is finally reaching the end game, witnessing the last, desperate throes of a regime that has destroyed one of Africa's few successful economies, forced a third of its people into the diaspora and the rest into poverty that is killing hundreds of thousands. \n\n  It may not happen Saturday, when President Robert Mugabe celebrates his 83rd birthday with bubbly and cake at a $1.2 million party while hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans struggle to survive on bread and water. \n\n  And it probably won't happen in the weeks leading up to April 18, the 27th anniversary of an end to racist white rule and Mugabe's ascension to power. \n\n  But years of abuse and neglect are culminating in untenable crises. \n\n  \"People's anger is mounting,\" said Zimbabwean political scientist John Makumbe. \"They're no longer afraid to go into the streets and I think the government is growing very afraid of what may happen.\" \n\n  Hyperinflation that brings shortages of food, fuel, medication, electricity, is spiraling out of control. Opposition from within his ruling party, which is divided over the timing of his succession and his successor, is mounting. \n\n  \"Each and every individual on the upper echelons\" is jockeying for his position, Mugabe complained in an interview on his actual birthday, Wednesday, broadcast over the country's sole and state-owned television station. \n\n  But, he announced categorically: \"There are no vacancies because I am still there.\" \n\n  Mugabe blames sanctions, drought and former colonizer the U.K. for the collapse of an economy based on exports of a wealth of agricultural and mineral products. \n\n  Others blame land grabs in which Mugabe encouraged blacks to violently force out most of the 5,000 white commercial farmers who owned 40% of all agricultural land and produced 75% of agricultural output. White farmers had employed the country's largest work force and their ejection led to the displacement of 300,000 families. \n\n  Today, the farms, most given to Mugabe relatives, allies and cronies, lie fallow and Zimbabwe doesn't have the foreign currency to import food. \n\n  On Mugabe's birthday, police announced a three-month ban on protests, following weekend clashes in which they fired tear gas and turned water cannon on opposition rallies. \n\n  The National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of human rights, church and grass-roots organizations, in a statement Friday said: \"It's not a crime to defend oneself from an unlawful attack, and if need be (people) should protect themselves from a partisan, violent police force that aims at perpetuating dictatorship and increasing the suffering of the ordinary masses.\" \n\n  Mugabe is \"at war\" with the people, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai declared this week. \n\n  Opposition supporters wanted to protest the high cost of living and Mugabe's plan to extend his term of office to 2010. \n\n  A rate of hyperinflation - running at near 1,600% - that economists say soon will be represented by an upright line on a graph has the country in revolt. The number of Zimbabwe dollars that bought a three-bedroom house with a swimming pool and tennis court in 1990 today will buy one sole brick. \n\n  A lifetime public worker's monthly pension can't buy a loaf of bread. Charities have reported depression, suicide and malnutrition among retirees - including a type of vitamin deficiency affecting gums, bones and hair loss. \n\n  Doctors and nurses have been on strike since December and the rest of the civil service is threatening to join them. \n\n  The list of deserters on the walls of army barracks grows ever longer despite a 300% pay raise in January. The military want a 1,000% increase. The police chief in the capital, Harare, has said in a confidential memo that he fears his constables will riot. \n\n  A hairdresser paid the minimum monthly wage of $30,000 said her bus fare to work cost more but she went anyway to get the tips from clients that keep her and a daughter alive. \n\n  Political scientist Makumbe said a 16-year-old who broke his collar bone falling out of a tree has lain at home in pain for days because his widowed mother doesn't have the million Zimbabwe dollars needed to have the bone set. \n\n  Makumbe said an estimated 70,000 people have died this year not because of the doctor's strike but because there are no drugs and because medical equipment like dialysis machines doesn't work any more. \n\n  Bread disappeared off the shelves this week after the government increased the price of grain sold to millers by 10,000% but didn't increase the controlled price for bread. \n\n  Water shortages have brought a cholera epidemic that is killing people. \n\n  Children are among the first to suffer, with one in four Zimbabwean children orphaned and more than 2 million vulnerable to starvation, the U.N. Children's Fund says. \n\n  The government tries to control inflation by printing money and setting the exchange rate. Last year, when half a dozen eggs cost more than a million Zimbabwe dollars and the poorest Zimbabweans were millionaires, the government simply knocked three zeros off the currency. The minimum monthly salary for a house cleaner went from $15 million to $15,000. The official exchange rate is set at 250 to the U.S. dollar, but the real trading rate is 5,000 to the dollar. \n\n  Some Zimbabweans are getting rich off the misery. Party and government officials with access to foreign currency buy it at the official rate and sell it at the real rate. \n\n  The World Bank estimates it would take more than 20 years for Zimbabwe's economy to return to 1980 levels. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 23, 2007 12:00 ET (17:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247662Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T18:08:31.273831Z", "inner_id": 250, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5619, "annotations": [{"id": 4489, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "QBOjl1VJeJ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283040Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283045Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 144.495, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "13ed5036-dd1c-479c-b282-06e0f4cfd930", "import_id": 360, "last_action": null, "task": 5619, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UPDATE:CEA:China Yuan Policy May Not Change Its Export Prices\n\n \n\n  (Updates with further detail.) \n\n \n   By Henry J. Pulizzi and Elizabeth Price \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--China's policy of depressing the value of its currency pushes domestic inflation higher, and leaves the relative price of goods the country trades unchanged, the White House said Monday. \n\n  \"Chinese intervention does not systematically change the relative real prices between the United States and China,\" the Council of Economic Advisers said in its annual economic report of the president. \n\n  China has been under heavy pressure from Congress and manufacturers to ease its tight grip on the yuan, which critics say undervalues the currency and gives Chinese products an unfair advantage in global markets. China's central bank buys dollars on foreign exchange markets each month to control the value of the yuan, also known as the renminbi. \n\n  According to Monday's report, the increase in China's inflation rate, spurred by the intervention, offsets any price declines resulting from the exchange rate movements. That conclusion suggests the intervention may have little impact on the U.S. trade balance with China, and raises the question of why the U.S. Treasury is devoting so much of its time and energy to persuading Beijing to allow the yuan to appreciate. \n\n  \"Fixing the nominal exchange rate does not tend to move countries away from purchasing power parity,\" the idea that identical goods and services should cost the same in different countries, CEA said. \"The only effect is that domestic goods prices have to do all of the adjustment since the exchange rate is fixed.\" \n\n  CEA said there is no \"clear preference\" between conducting monetary policy with a fixed exchange rate or through short-term interest rates. \n\n  \"In the end, central banks that choose to fix the value of their exchange rate relative to another currency and central banks that choose to set a short-term interest rate are each choosing a different tool to conduct monetary policy,\" CEA said. \n\n  Though the panel said economic theory doesn't dictate a preference between the two systems, it said interest-rate targeting is the preferred tool because no major industrialized nation's central bank uses a fixed exchange rate. CEA Chairman Edward Lazear said the panel is \"agnostic\" on the issue. \n\n  \"Our goal in this chapter was simply to explain the effects of a variety of different strategies, and that's why we said we don't want to take a position on one over the other,\" Lazear said. \n\n  In July 2005, China officially ended its policy of pegging its currency to the dollar, moving to a system of managing the yuan against an unpublished basket of currencies. \n\n  Though the yuan has appreciated more than 6% since July 2005, U.S. exporters, lawmakers and the Bush administration believe it needs to rise further against the dollar. The Treasury Department is pushing China to let the yuan appreciate in the short term, and move to a freely floating currency regime in the longer run. The disagreement between Washington and Beijing is over the pace of reform. \n\n  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the White House's point man on the issue, told lawmakers last month that Beijing needs to take four steps toward floating the yuan. It must widen the currency's trading band, lower central-bank purchases of dollars, develop a bond market and create central bank policy targets to avoid inflation and boost confidence in the yuan. \n\n  \"China does not yet have the currency policy we want it to have and that it needs,\" Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee. \"China's cautious approach to exchange rate reform exacerbates distortions in its domestic economy and impedes the adjustment of international imbalances.\" \n\n  Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries, meeting over the weekend in Germany, urged China to focus on the trade-weighted value of the yuan. \"In emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur,\" the finance ministers said. \n\n  Earlier Monday, the Chinese government said the country's trade surplus jumped 67% last month from a year earlier to $15.88 billion. \n\n \n\n  -By Henry J.

If interest rates and investor sentiment changes, these often-complex carry trades could sour quickly and roil the economy of Switzerland and perhaps elsewhere. Last year when Japan indicated it might raise its superlow rates, the announcement rattled global markets as traders tried to adjust their strategies. \n\n  Yesterday, the SNB raised its base interest rate by a quarter-point to 2.25%. The SNB targets a range for the three-month franc London interbank offered rate, and aims for the midpoint of the range, now 1.75% to 2.75%. \n\n  Low Borrowing Costs \n\n  Still, Swiss borrowing costs remain the second-lowest in the industrialized world, after Japan's 0.5% rate. \n\n  The low Swiss interest rates, according to the bank, are still stoking growth in the domestic economy, where annual inflation in February was zero. But the carry trade raises concerns that local inflation could start galloping higher. \n\n  That is because one byproduct of the carry trade is to weaken the Swiss franc compared with other currencies. A weaker currency means Swiss companies and consumers must shell out more francs for imported goods. (The carry trade weakens the Swiss currency because essentially, speculators are selling it in order to buy, say, Icelandic kronur; all that selling pushes down the franc's value.) \n\n  Indeed, the franc is hovering near eight-year lows against the euro. It has also fallen nearly 10% against the dollar since 2005, putting the value of one Swiss franc at about 82 cents. A weak franc is good news for Swiss exporters, because it makes their products more affordable to buyers in other countries. \n\n  There are also concerns that the currency speculation could destabilize economies in Eastern Europe, where the sale of franc-denominated mortgages is booming. The risk is that any rise in the value of the franc would increase the debt burdens and mortgage payments for people whose earnings are in, say, the Hungarian currency, the forint. \n\n  \"We've tried to say, don't assume it's always going to be this way,\" says Philipp Hildebrand, a member of the Swiss central bank's board. \n\n  In addition, Swiss-franc loans often offer floating interest rates, which means debt burdens will spike if Swiss interest rates do. Mr. Hildebrand noted that the franc recently bounced back a bit against major currencies as worried global investors unwound some of their currency bets -- a small warning of what can happen. \n\n  Market estimates of the yen carry trade typically start around $200 billion, and increase from there. Though experts say the franc trade is smaller, in part because Swiss interest rates are higher, few doubt that hedge funds and currency traders could lose billions of dollars if the yen or Swiss franc suddenly rose in value. \n\n  Pain of Franc Spike \n\n  A spike in the franc also could break many ordinary borrowers' backs. With interest rates in the euro zone and many Eastern European countries outpacing Switzerland's, banks outside the country increasingly offer loans in Swiss francs. \n\n  \"It's like a carry trade for the household,\" says Michael Saunders, a Citigroup economist in London. He warns that typical carry-trade investors are steeped in the complexities of currency risk, and far more likely to protect themselves when engaging in currency bets than ordinary borrowers. \n\n  According to the Bank for International Settlements, which collects data from 40 central banks, the value of Swiss loans granted to companies or individuals outside Switzerland rose to $138 billion in the third quarter last year, from $61 billion in the same period of 2002. Economists suspect much of that increase was accounted for by these so-called household carry trades. \n\n  Austrians, who have been borrowing in Swiss franc since the mid-1990s, held 34 billion euros ($45 billion) of foreign-currency loans last December. Several banks in Greece started offering Swiss-franc mortgages last fall. Both Austria and Greece belong to the euro zone, where interest rates hit 3.75% last week and are likely to rise to at least 4% this year. \n\n  Eastern Europeans with historically volatile currencies have also recently embraced the franc. Hungarian households held about 6.6 billion euros of Swiss-franc debt last December, a jump of 87% from 2005. \n\n  Much as Switzerland's central bankers might like to raise interest rates further to make the carry trade less attractive, they are limited in what they can do. The bank targets a medium-term inflation rate of 2%, and inflation is at zero. \n\n  The bank's most recent forecasts, released yesterday, show inflation nearing the 2% target again in 2009, and markets expect another rate increase to 2.50% at the bank's next meeting in June. But with interest rates in many major economies high or rising as well, the Swiss franc looks unlikely to lose its allure for foreign borrowers anytime soon. \n\n  --- \n\n  Dollar Rises Against Yen \n\n  In Bumpy but Tight Trade \n\n \n\n  Meanwhile, in New York trading, the dollar was higher against the yen in a bumpy but range-bound session that shadowed U.S. equities and paid little attention to a spate of mixed, second-tier data. \n\n  But investors, nervous over U.S. subprime mortgage weakness and the U.S. economy in general, failed to make any big moves. \n\n  \"There was limited participation as the choppy moves of the last couple days discouraged people from being overactive in currencies,\" said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. \n\n  Late in New York, the dollar was changing hands at 117.56 yen versus 117.07 yen late Wednesday, while the euro stood at $1.3237, up slightly from $1.3229. The euro traded at 155.59 yen versus 154.63 yen.

Fifteen of 16 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the RBNZ to raise rates by 25 basis points, while the Overnight Index Swap market had priced in an 86% chance of a hike. \n\n  The RBNZ raised interest rates nine times and by a total of 225 basis points between January 2004 and December 2005 to cool pricing pressures brought on by five years of robust economic growth. \n\n  While the pace of growth in New Zealand has been slowing since mid-2005, recent data have sent mixed signals on the health of the economy, with near-term inflation pressures abating, but housing and labor markets remaining stubbornly tight, retail spending resilient, and business confidence at multiyear highs. \n\n  New Zealand's on-year inflation eased to 2.6% in the fourth quarter from 3.5% in the third quarter to fall back within the RBNZ's 1%-3% target band. But domestic inflation, which excludes import prices, remains at an uncomfortably high 3.8%. \n\n  House price growth, a major concern for policymakers, moderated to 9% on year in January but failed to provide the clear slowdown sought by the central bank. \n\n  The RBNZ revised lower its short-term CPI forecasts to 1.9% for the first half of 2007 from its December forecast of 2.4%, and to 1.6% in the second half from 2.3%, due mainly to a higher New Zealand dollar exchange rate and lower gasoline prices. \n\n  However, inflation is expected to accelerate in 2008, hitting a peak of 2.7% in the first half of 2009. \n\n  \"A return to a moderating trend in housing and domestic demand will be essential if we are to see a reduction in medium-term inflation pressures,\" Bollard said. \n\n  He noted the central bank continues to assess alternative measures to support the official cash rate, such as a tightening of tax rules on housing investment and changes to bank capital requirements to moderate the \"amplifying effect of credit on the housing cycle.\" \n\n \n \nInflation, Monetary Conditions Projections \n                      1H07    2H07    1H08 \n90-Day Bill (Avg)     7.80    7.90    7.90 \nNZD TWI (Avg)        68.60   68.30   67.30 \nCPI (Annual)          1.9%    1.6%    2.4% \nEconomic Projections  - March Years \n                      2007    2008    2009 \nGDP                   2.40%   3.00%   2.20% \nTerms Of Trade       -0.80%  -0.90%  -1.80% \nCurr Acct % GDP      -8.60%  -8.50%  -8.10% \nWorld GDP             3.50%   3.40%   3.60% \nWorld CPI             2.00%   2.00%   2.10% \n \n\n   -By Rachel Pannett, Dow Jones Newswires; 64-4-471-5990; rachel.pannett@dowjones.com (Symon Ross in Wellington also contributed to this article) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 07, 2007 15:03 ET (20:03 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247767Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247773Z", "inner_id": 253, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5622, "annotations": [{"id": 4492, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "gKH3mQW8LE", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283122Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283127Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 144.775, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "7a66d7be-3e5e-46ca-91f4-146f197e60b2", "import_id": 363, "last_action": null, "task": 5622, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DATA SNAP: Colombia Feb CPI +1.17% Vs +0.90% Consensus\n\n \n     Consumer Price Index: (percentage increases, month-on-month) \n          Feb    Jan     Dec    Nov    Oct     Feb/06 \nForecast +0.90%  +0.65%  +0.17% +0.24%  +0.20%  +0.77% \nActual   +1.17%  +0.77%  +0.23% +0.14%  -0.14%  +0.66% \n \n\n  By Diana Delgado \n\n  Of Dow Jones Newswires \n\n  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--Colombian consumer prices advanced a higher-than-expected in February owing to a sharp hike in education costs and due to a strong increase in the food sector as dry and cold weather damaged crops, the national statistics department, known as DANE, said late Thursday. \n\n  The statistics department said consumer price index rose 1.17% in February, while a Dow Jones Newswires survey of nine economists had produced a median estimate of a 0.90% increase of the index. \n\n  Colombian consumer prices were up 5.25% in the 12-month period to February. \n\n  The sharpest advance in February came from the educational sector which accounts for 4.8% of the CPI measurement. With the start of the school year leading to higher tuition expenditure and books costs, prices in the sector surged 3.94%. \n\n  The closely watched food sector, which has a 30% weighting in the CPI, increased 2.11%, as prices of vegetables and fruits climbed sharply in February. \n\n  El Nino warm current in the Pacific Ocean has caused drought in several parts of the country and night frost in the region around Bogota over the past two months. \n\n  \"The data is madness,\" said Cesar Tovar, analyst at the local unit of Stanford Group. \"The market was an expecting a maximum of 1%,\" he added. \n\n  Tovar expects yields on peso-denominated debt to increase Friday as a result of the higher-than-expected inflation figure. \n\n  He added that the data could comprise this year's central bank's target range of 3.5%-4.5%. \n\n  The central bank may be inclined to keep increasing rates at a faster pace as a result of the data, Tovar added. \n\n  On Friday, the monetary authority decided to hike its benchmark interest rate to 8% from 7.75% to tame rising inflation pressures. That was the eighth time the central bank has raised its benchmark rate since last April, when it stood at 6%. \n\n  Alberto Ramos, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a report Friday that if the Colombian economy doesn't show signs of cooling off, the bank could increase rates to as high as 9%. \n\n  Colombian inflation rose 4.48% in 2006, in line with last year's target range of 4% to 5%. \n\n \n\n  -By Diana Delgado, Dow Jones Newswires; 57-315-3088934; diana.delgado@dowjones.com \n\n  (Luis Enrique Hurtado contributed to this article) \n\n \n\n  Corrected March 2, 2007 14:45 ET (1945GMT)\n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 01, 2007 20:06 ET (01:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247797Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247803Z", "inner_id": 254, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5623, "annotations": [{"id": 4493, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "vVkOhfD7VU", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283150Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283156Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 150.202, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "7a30e16c-c058-42b4-b7ae-d9389aeb76b5", "import_id": 364, "last_action": null, "task": 5623, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "CHINA WATCH: Rate Hike Shows Beijing Favoring Market Tactics\n\n \n   By Rick Carew \n \n   A Dow Jones Newswires Column \n \n\n  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--China's efforts to tame resurgent lending and investment won't stop at Saturday's interest rate hike and the central bank could soon back up its tightening with a second rate increase in coming months, economists said. \n\n  By raising interest rates, the central bank has put market-based tools back at the forefront of its battle against economic overheating. Most economists expect inflation, investment and other data in coming months to show economic growth momentum remains strong, encouraging further tightening. \n\n  Still, the People's Bank of China is unlikely to let up on other tightening measures, including bill sales, higher bank reserves requirements and administrative steps aimed at soaking up excess liquidity. The broad package of measures won't likely include a formal widening of the yuan's daily trading band against the U.S. dollar although the Chinese currency's appreciation trend could accelerate, economists said. \n\n  China's monetary policy, said Goldman Sachs analyst Hong Liang, is still \"far from where the neutral policy stance should be\" and the yuan's rise so far, including initial revaluation, isn't enough for China to regain monetary policy independence. \n\n  She expects another 27 basis-point rate rise in June or July, and a 7% rise in the yuan against the U.S. dollar over the next 12 months. \n\n  \"The symmetric hike suggests the PBOC no longer considers it necessary to protect banks' margins,\" said ING, adding it regards rate hikes as \"data-driven, especially data on loan growth.\"   \"We forecast another 27-basis-point hike in lending and deposit rates in 4Q 2007 and one 50 basis-point hike in the reserve requirement every quarter for the next couple of years.\" \n\n  The central bank increased banks' reserves requirements twice so far this year, hiking the ratio by 50 basis points each time. \n\n  The stock market initially took a hit opening sharply lower. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index opened down 2.3% at 2864.26 and the Shenzhen Composite Index opened down 2.8% at 753.08. But within the hour the indexes turned around, rising steadily with large capitalization banks leading the path. The Shanghai index was up 2.5% at 3003.98 by midday and the Shenzhen index was up 1.1% at 782.88. \n\n  The U.S. dollar fell to CNY7.7350 midday on the over-the-counter market versus CNY7.7360 on Friday after the yuan was set at its strongest-ever level versus the dollar, CNY7.7351, in the central bank's central parity. China's bond prices also edged lower, and could continue to fall in coming weeks. The government bond index on the Shanghai exchange was at 111.71 at midday, down from Friday's close of  111.83, but also up from a morning low of 111.50. \n\n  Saturday's well-flagged rate increase announcement came after a string of strong data in recent weeks, with the most recent showing capital investment continued to increase strongly. China's urban fixed-asset investment in January and February rose 23.4% from the same period last year, faster than the average 21.8% forecast of seven economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and is an acceleration from December's FAI growth rate of 13.8%. \n\n  Although inflation remains within the central bank's under-3% target, PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan reportedly said Monday that he's more concerned about the trend. \n\n  China's consumer price index rose 2.7% in February from a year earlier, picking up from the 2.2% rise in January. In the first two months of the year, CPI rose 2.4% from the same period last year. \n\n  Economists expect rate hikes and a faster pace of yuan appreciation this year to overshadow stricter investment approval and control measures that have dominated the past tightening cycle. \n\n  The primary reason: China's huge and widening trade surplus. The gap between exports and imports rose 74% to $177.5 billion last year. The most recent data shows that hasn't eased as February's surplus hit US$23.76 billion widely outdoing the expected $8.3 billion surplus. \n\n  \"It should have become clear by now for Chinese policy makers that each time domestic investment got hit hard by policy tightening, China's trade surplus would surge,\" said Goldman Sachs in a note. \n\n  That could mean that China's other major economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, may play a smaller role in this round of tightening as Beijing fears tightening investment will depress the imports it wants to increase to close the trade gap. \n\n  The shift would also allow policy makers to test the ability of China's deepening financial markets' ability to respond to market-based controls. \n\n  China's economic planning agency may have also played a larger role last year as it was the start of a five-year planning period, where local governments set investment targets and start new major outlays. \n\n \n\n  -By Rick Carew, Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588-5848; rick.carew@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 19, 2007 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247831Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247837Z", "inner_id": 255, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5624, "annotations": [{"id": 4494, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "BuKgXpPry5", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283178Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-06T11:04:30.731914Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 206.414, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "b988b94e-0223-49b7-b144-e100cc448a78", "import_id": 365, "last_action": null, "task": 5624, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "PREVIEW:Indonesia Mar Inflation Milder; Feb Trade Surplus Up\n\n \n\n  By I Made Sentana \n\n  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  JAKARTA (Dow Jones)--Indonesia's inflation rate likely decelerated this month as the government managed to tame basic food prices, while stronger global commodity prices probably supported a trade surplus last month, analysts said. \n\n  Market-watchers will scrutinize the inflation and trade data more closely than usual as the central bank is seen as being at a crossroads on its rate policy. The Central Statistics Bureau is due to issue both sets of data around 0630 GMT Monday. \n\n  The average forecast of a Dow Jones Newswires survey of regional economists is for the Consumer Price Index to have risen 0.23% on month in March and 6.46% on year. Those projections compare with a rise of 0.62% on month and 6.30% on year in February. \n\n  The expected higher on-year inflation rate is due to a low base. \n\n  \"We expect to see a moderate level of inflation in March...as the prices of rice and sugar have been stable with a slight decline (in) the last week of the month,\" said Anton Gunawan, an economist with Citigroup in Jakarta. \n\n  On the trade front, the country's performance likely continued to be robust on the back of high prices and strong demand for oil, gas and commodities exports, analysts said. \n\n  Still, the trade surplus is projected to have edged up only slightly to $3.13 billion from $3.11 billion in January, the survey showed. \n\n  Exports are expected to have increased 13.05% on year in February, while imports are forecast to have risen 15.34%. In January, Indonesia's exports were $8.35 billion and imports $5.24 billion. \n\n  Given the likely inflation and trade data, four economists called for a 25-basis point cut in Bank Indonesia's policy rate when the central bank meets next. If Bank Indonesia keeps the rate unchanged, it will mark the second such pause since monetary policy easing began in May last year. \n\n  Bank Indonesia's Board of Governors will decide on possible adjustments to the benchmark rate, now at 9.00%, on April 5. \n\n \nFORECASTS OF INDONESIA MARCH CPI, February TRADE DATA \nINSTITUTION        CPI   CPI    EXPORTS IMPORTS TRD SURPLUS                                                      \n                  ON-MO ON-YR    ON-YR   ON-YR \nBII               +0.02% +6.29% +11.48% +10.45%  $3.23B \nDanareksa         +0.22% +6.50% +18.06% +14.95%  $3.53B \nCitigroup         +0.40  +6.69% +07.70% +11.50%  $2.92B \nMandiri Sekuritas +0.22% +6.50% +12.30% +15.40%  $3.08B \nLippo Bank        +0.33% +6.62% +12.40% +24.40%  $2.66B \nAction Economics  +0.20% +6.50% +17.00% +13.20%  $3.50B \nIdeaGlobal.come    n/a   +6.15% +12.40% +17.50%  $2.99B \nAVERAGE           +0.23% +6.46% +13.05% +15.34%  $3.13B \nPREVIOUS          +0.62% +6.30% +10.50% +19.50%  $3.11B \n \nFORECASTS OF BANK INDONESIA'S RATE DECISION APRIL 5 \nINSTITUTION                       CHANGE IN BPS \nBank Internasional Indonesia           -25 \nIdeaGlobal                             -25 \nLippo Bank                             -25 \nAction Economics                       -25 \n \n\n  -By I Made Sentana; Dow Jones Newswires; 62 21 3983 1277; I-Made.Sentana@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 28, 2007 23:56 ET (03:56 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247863Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-06T11:04:31.024499Z", "inner_id": 256, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5625, "annotations": [{"id": 4495, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "f6z0Gy0aFQ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283205Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283210Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 1723.715, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "a0d6f7f1-fd66-42e9-b4d8-e743fb7a0ac1", "import_id": 366, "last_action": null, "task": 5625, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Barron&apos;s(4/9) Other Voices: Golden Rules For Growing Economies\n\n   (From BARRON'S) \n   By Jack White and Doug Ramsey \n\n  How can we explain the economic miracles of the last 40 years? Why have some nations prospered and others not? \n\n  India was positioned for the new world of outsourcing because so many Indians inherited the language of Shakespeare from the British Raj. \n\n  Japan's vertical, soup-to-nuts zaibatsu, or conglomerates, were well equipped to compete in export markets. \n\n  South Korea's early years of benevolent but undemocratic rule allowed the country to invest heavily inhigh-tech industries that would have foundered in a less-ordered economy. \n\n  Ireland turned its relative poverty into a prime asset, since it could be the European Community's low-wage magnet for international manufacturers. \n\n  These widely accepted explanations of economic success are mostly accidents of geography or history. \n\n  If speaking English were a guarantee of economic success, many former British colonies -- such as Malawi and Tanzania -- would not currently rank among the poorest nations in the world. \n\n  Greece succeeded Ireland as the poor man of today's European Union, but a flood of investment never materialized there. \n\n  If government intervention could ensure economic success, most Third World nations would no longer need to be international beggars to stay afloat. \n\n  And if democracy were the acid test of financial bounty, communist China would not be today's greatest economic turnaround story. \n\n  Economic miracles depend on three old-fashioned rules that also apply to career and business success. \n\n \n\n  -- Do it differently and do it better. \n\n \n\n  Whether companies are looking to gain market share or nations are aiming to boost gross domestic product, they need strategies that are both different and better. \n\n  Take South Korea. Through the 1980s, the country successfully modeled its economy on that of another resource-poor neighbor, Japan. With its cheaper labor, Korea slowly took heavy industries away from Japan-shipbuilding and steel, for example. \n\n  But Korea's greatest success dates back to the early 1990s, when the country finally stopped mimicking Japan and decided that it had the wherewithal to leap ahead of its neighbor and, indeed, most of the world. \n\n  With a combination of moral persuasion as well as judicious doses of government investment, Korea Inc. made a bold bid to become one of the world's first knowledge economies. \n\n  Understanding the importance of connectivity in an R&D-based economy, Korea resolved to make high-speed Internet access available to all Koreans, becoming the world leader in broadband penetration within five years. The country is doing the same with wireless broadband. \n\n  In retrospect, an important milestone was Korea's decision to adopt a little-known digital wireless technology called code-division multiple access, developed by a then-small San Diego company called Qualcomm. CDMA is a spread-spectrum technology that uses digital coding to allow many more wireless-phone calls to share the same bandwidth -- greatly increasing capacity and reducing costs. \n\n  By focusing on a new wireless standard rather than the entrenched system used primarily in Europe, Korean manufacturers could address their own market, and obtain a pole position in the U.S. cellular market. If you use a Samsung or LG phone today, it is because of a decision to do it differently and do it better made in Korea nearly 20 years ago. \n\n \n\n  -- Accept change, don't reject it. \n\n \n\n  Volumes have been written about how to master change, and about companies that have failed to do so. To its peril, Lucent was slow to make the transition from analog to digital technology. Many U.S. manufacturers failed to wake up to the fact of globalization until it was too late. \n\n  The Internet and broadband wireless are revolutionizing the information infrastructure and the way products are distributed and sold, and any company that fails to adapt to the new realities is likely to be left behind. \n\n  So what happens when it is an entire country that must accept change? \n\n  Recognizing that its economy was stymied by the failures of socialism, China opted for a different path. It instigated a parallel, free-market economy that would gradually become untethered from the political apparatus of the communist state. \n\n  The reforms began in 1979, a full decade before the fall of the Soviet Union. The ensuing boom proved that a 5,000-year-old country could turn on a dime if its mandarins largely stayed out of the market's way. \n\n  Within the global economy, China used its economies of scale to capture entire industries where its cheap labor gave it an advantage, while rotating its earnings into high-end technology industries that could compete head-on with the best in the West. \n\n  Of course, acceptance of change is, of itself, no guarantee of success. Unlike China, Russia embraced wholesale political as well as economic change almost overnight, but the ensuing free-for-all made a mockery of both democracy and free markets. A few \"oligarchs\" prospered, but the Russian economy took a decade to recover from the shock to its system. \n\n  Today's seeming health of the Russian economy stems from one of those accidents of geography: plentiful oil reserves. But as oil prices decline, so will Russia's economy. So it's not just accepting change, but how nations embrace change that makes the difference. \n\n \n\n  -- Educate your citizens. \n\n \n\n  Like the old adage about the importance of location in retailing, education is of paramount importance to every economy. Japan, Korea, Singapore -- indeed all the so-called 'tiger' economies of Asia --  stressed the importance of literacy and invested heavily in education long before their economies took off. \n\n  The rapid ascent of India and China in recent years, in large measure, is due to their ability to bring masses of literate, numerate workers into high-tech industries that depend increasingly on research and development for growth. \n\n  China and the U.S. awarded roughly the same number of undergraduate engineering degrees in 1986; since then, U.S. degrees have steeply declined, to 60,000 a year -- and many of these are awarded to foreign-born students -- while China is producing more than 250,000 a year. As part of its plan to become a developed nation by 2015, India has plans to educate more than 4 million engineers annually. \n\n  Increasingly, the call-center jobs for U.S. consumer-products companies outsourced to Bangalore are making opportunities for research and development jobs. \n\n  High-tech multinationals recognize that innovation can happen anywhere, as long as the workforce is highly trained and has good incentives. This comes as no surprise to the Indians, or Chinese, or Japanese, who watched the great clusters of innovation in the United States grow up in Silicon Valley, San Diego, Chicago, Boston, Research Triangle, Seattle and other places, always with good access to major universities. \n\n  Even in labor-intensive sectors where R&D is not as big a factor, skilled workers can play a critical role in devising new quality-of-service methods and improvements in manufacturing. A culture of education permeates societies where economic miracles have occurred. \n\n  Economic miracles do happen, but there is nothing miraculous about them. Countries from China to Chile, India to Ireland, went back to basics and followed a few golden rules to succeed. They now welcome change and count on knowledge workers and innovation to keep their economies growing. \n\n  The United States can and must do the same. \n\n  --- \n\n  Jack White was a pioneer in the discount stock-brokerage industry, and Doug Ramsey is director of communications for the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology at UC/San Diego. \n\n  --- \n\n  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 07, 2007 00:09 ET (04:09 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247902Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.247908Z", "inner_id": 257, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5626, "annotations": [{"id": 4496, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "WU_hWiz4Di", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283233Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.283238Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 133.514, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "b39ebcb7-eb73-4d90-828d-a3e8f7a7fa86", "import_id": 367, "last_action": null, "task": 5626, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(4/28) Abreast Of The Market: Microsoft, GE, 3M Rise Fri\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n   By Karen Talley \n\n  As the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its record run to a third straight session Friday, the might was provided by Microsoft, General Electric and 3M. \n\n  The Dow industrials rose 15.44 points to 13120.94, passing Thursday's record of 13105.5.

It is an issue of monetary policy. Meddling in each other's monetary policy is usually avoided (by G7 officials). In that sense, (the yen) probably won't become an openly debated topic.\" \n\n  Sakakibara served as vice finance minister for international affairs between 1997-1999 and was known as Mr Yen for his ability to move the exchange rate of the currency with his comments. He currently is director of Waseda University's Indian economic studies institute. \n\n  His comments are in line with currency traders' expectations that the Japanese currency will take a back seat to other issues at the coming G7 talks because the dollar and the euro have slowed their pace of appreciation versus the yen after a global stock market selloff and temporary yen surges in late February and early March. \n\n  Still, G7 officials don't all agree with Sakakibara. \n\n  Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi said earlier Tuesday that he doubts G7 officials will discuss the yen, but his Canadian counterpart, Jim Flaherty, said Monday that he \"wouldn't be surprised if (the yen's exchange rate) was the subject of some discussion.\" \n\n  Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the U.S., Japan, Germany, England, France, Italy and Canada will meet in Washington, D.C. on April 13. \n\n  G7 May Warn Vs Yen-Carry Trades Again \n\n  Sakakibara said that while G7 representatives may skirt around the yen's value, they will likely repeat their warning made in February about yen-carry trades, a risky investment strategy that many analysts blame for the yen's persistent weakness. \n\n  \"The markets are continuing carry trades,\" he said. \"There's no question that the yen is abnormally weak.\" \n\n  For example, the euro's \"fair value\" against the yen is Y110.00 to Y115.00 based on Japan's trade competitiveness and other factors, said Sakakibara. That is well below the common European currency's current level of Y158.34. \n\n  As for the dollar-yen exchange rate, he said that given Japan's international competitiveness, the country's manufacturers \"can easily live with rates of around Y100.00 to Y110.00.\" \n\n  \"For the time being\", however, the greenback will hug a range of Y115.00 to Y120.00, underpinned by Japanese investors' appetite for overseas assets that pay higher returns than those at home, he said. \n\n  At 1000 GMT Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at Y118.60. \n\n \n   Bank of Japan May Raise Interest Rates Next Month \n \n\n  Turning to Japan's monetary policy, Sakakibara said the Bank of Japan may increase interest rates in May because the country's economy is in its \"best condition\", growing at a price-adjusted annual pace of around 2.5% while prices are stable. \n\n  \"I think a May rate hike is possible,\" he said. \n\n  \"To be sure, things would evolve differently if the (Japanese) economy slipped into a downtrend or stock prices make a nosedive,\" he said. \"But as long as the current economic conditions are maintained, a May hike would be nothing strange.\" \n\n  Sakakibara's prediction is at odds with consensus that the central bank will stand pat until after parliamentary elections in July. \n\n  \"The markets have been wrong recently,\" forecasting a rate hike in January, when the bank stayed put, while anticipating no tightening in February, when the bank lifted rates by a quarter percentage point to 0.50%, he said. \"It may be wise not to put your faith on the markets.\" \n\n  Sakakibara himself urged the BOJ to \"normalize\" Japan's \"unusually low interest rates\" and stop fueling yen-carry trades by pumping money into the world's money markets. \n\n  \"There're various opinions (on what levels constitute normal policy rates in Japan), but ... they may be around 2.0%,\" he said.

(KMB) reported a 64% increase in its first-quarter profit, propelled by growth in its North American personal care business, strength in emerging markets and higher prices for some of its products. \n\n  The company, which sells brands like Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, continues to face inflationary pressures due to an escalation in fiber costs. Kimberly Clark's first-quarter earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, but the company left its forecast for the year unchanged due to commodity cost pressures. The lower end of the company's guidance range for the year is below Wall Street's average estimate. The stock was recently down $1.04, or 1.4%, to $70.90. \n\n  Like most other consumer-product companies Kimberly-Clark has been grappling with higher commodity prices and has been forced to prune costs in order to keep increasing profits. In July 2005, the company announced a cost reduction plan that would streamline its manufacturing and administrative operations. The company said it continues to execute this plan and is in a good position to meet or exceed its target to save $75 million to $100 million for the first year. \n\n  The Irving, Texas, maker of personal-care and health-care products earned $452 million, or 98 cents a share, compared with $275.1 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. \n\n  Excluding items related to the company's ongoing restructuring, earnings rose to $1.03 a share from 93 cents a share a year earlier. \n\n  Sales for the first quarter totaled $4.39 billion, up from $4.07 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial, on average, expected the company to earn $1.01 a share in the latest period on revenue of $4.27 billion. \n\n  \"Overall I think they are making small steps in the right direction,\" said A.G. Edwards analyst Jason Gere. The company's personal-care business is doing extremely well, he said. \n\n  Still, Gere said he found Kimberly-Clark's guidance for the full year somewhat conservative. \"I don't blame them - fiber costs are still going up,\" said Gere. \n\n  JPMorgan analyst John Faucher wrote that sales volumes  in the company's consumer tissue segment - which were down 2% - came in below his expectations. \n\n  In developing and emerging markets, sales increased 16%. Kimberly-Clark said sales growth was particularly strong in Latin America, China and Russia. \n\n  Sales of personal-care products, which also include Kotex feminine care items, increased 11% in the quarter to $1.8 billion. Sales of Huggies diapers, baby wipes and Pull-Ups training pants were strong. \n\n  Sales of consumer tissue products, such as Kleenex and Scott bathroom tissue, grew 6.4% to $1.59 billion. \n\n  Kimberly-Clark had recently said it expects first-quarter adjusted earnings to be at or slightly above the high end of its previous guidance of 99 cents to $1.01 a share. \n\n  Kimberly-Clark expects adjusted earnings for the second quarter of $1.01 to $1.03 a share. For 2007, the company projects adjusted earnings of $4.10 to $4.20 a share. On average, Wall Street is expecting second-quarter earnings of $1.02 a share and full-year earnings of $4.20 a share. \n\n  \"We also remain focused on cutting costs although the industry experts are predicting that fiber costs will come down later this year,\" Chief Executive Thomas Falk said in a conference call. \"We'll continue to monitor input costs and the competitive environment carefully to see if any other actions are required.\" \n\n  Kimberly-Clark was a client of A.G. Edwards and JP Morgan in the past 12 months. \n\n  -By Anjali Cordeiro, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2408; anjali.cordeiro@dowjones.com \n\n  (Josee Rose and Arthur Daniels contributed to this article.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 23, 2007 11:06 ET (15:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248033Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-01T18:17:36.378782Z", "inner_id": 261, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5630, "annotations": [{"id": 4500, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "kSuRTMRqKO", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.341704Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.341710Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 54.789, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "d7104b7f-33cf-4cd4-8242-3ab083b7b62b", "import_id": 371, "last_action": null, "task": 5630, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Romania Ctrl Bk Cuts 2007 CPI Forecast To 3.7%-Mediafax -2-\n\n \n\n  The bank is sticking to its previous forecast of an acceleration in annual inflation to 4.2% in 2008, he told a news conference.

Dean Foods Co., which makes ice cream, Horizon organic milk and yogurt, earlier this month warned it would only meet the lower end of a previous forecast. \n\n  Dean Foods' stock price is off 25% so far this year, while Hershey's stock is up 5%. \n\n  \"We are increasingly concerned about rapidly rising raw-milk prices and industry estimates for continued increases through the balance of the year,\" Dean Foods Chief Executive Gregg Engles told analysts and investors in a conference call in early May. \n\n  A confluence of factors are propelling dairy prices higher. Prices for corn, which is used in the production of ethanol, have been rising because of a surge in demand for biofuel. The higher prices for corn, coupled with higher costs for soybeans and hay, have been making livestock feed more expensive. \n\n  There also are other forces in play. According to Chris Galen, spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, a number of food companies have been looking to buy milk produced without the use of the artificial bovine growth hormones known as RVST. While use of those hormones can help increase productivity, a drop in usage crimps supply, he said. \n\n  At the same time, demand for dairy products has been strong internationally because of a weaker dollar, strong demand from fast-growing Asian economies and a slowdown in the dairy industries of Australia and New Zealand, Mr. Galen said. \n\n  \"Demand is going to be very strong globally and that is going to push market prices higher this year,\" said Kenneth Bailey, associate professor for agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University. \n\n  Class III milk futures, which represent milk used in cheddar cheese, have risen roughly 32% on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange so far this year. Class IV milk futures, which represent milk used to make butter and nonfat dry milk, are up about 26%. \n\n  Food companies have been grappling with a variety of inflationary pressures. Energy prices are off last year's peak, but oil remains above $60 a barrel. Most food companies have to raise prices for their products in order to fight the cost pressures. Prices for grains like wheat have increased in tandem with corn. \n\n  Kraft Foods Inc. said it increased prices earlier this year on some of its dairy-based products because of rising commodity costs. The company -- whose stable of brands includes Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft singles -- said it continues to monitor the market, and will adjust its prices accordingly. \n\n  Raising prices can be a difficult decision for food companies like Kraft, which are facing competition from cheaper private-label, or store, brands, said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. Still, he added that the rise in a commodity such as milk tends to be felt by private-label producers too. \n\n  \"If everyone is feeling pinched, it's easier to get pricing,\" Mr. Warren said. \"In this case it is probably likely everyone will be able to take some incremental pricing.\" \n\n  Food companies sometimes try hedging techniques to protect themselves against higher commodity prices. But commodity prices can be volatile and the hedging process complicated. \n\n  \"We did a very small hedging operation with regard to dairy about 18 months ago, but we couldn't get sufficient interest from a counterparty [for it] to be significant for us,\" said Starbucks Corp. Chief Financial Officer Michael Casey on a conference call this month. The coffee chain has felt the impact of higher dairy costs, and has said its outlook for the year takes those pressures into consideration. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 15, 2007 20:02 ET (00:02 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248093Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248099Z", "inner_id": 263, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5632, "annotations": [{"id": 4502, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "KFAmArVmEU", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.341767Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.341773Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 94.289, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "1c12b2c9-aa70-4201-882d-184e5265941f", "import_id": 373, "last_action": null, "task": 5632, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Zimbabwe Pres Tells African Trade Bloc Seek Econ Independence\n\n  NAIROBI (AP)--Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, whose country is in a financial tailspin, told Africa's largest trading bloc Wednesday that the continent will achieve true economic independence by producing finished goods for sale to the rest of the world. \n\n  Mugabe spoke during the final day of a summit by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, which is trying to make it cheaper and easier to do business on an impoverished continent that is struggling to lure foreign investment. \n\n  \"Because we are producers of primary products, the commodities we produce are not priced by us,\" Mugabe told leaders of the 20-nation bloc, known as COMESA. \"They go to markets where they are priced for us.\" \n\n  Zimbabwe is struggling through its worst economic crisis since independence in 1980, with an inflation rate in the thousands. The problems have been blamed on corruption, mismanagement and the often-violent seizures of thousands of white-owned commercial farms ordered by Mugabe beginning in 2000 that disrupted the agriculture-based economy. \n\n  On Tuesday, COMESA endorsed a standard customs tax as part of a deal designed to make doing business in Africa more attractive to investors. The agreement is set to go into effect in 2008. \n\n  The deal calls for charging 10% tax on semi-processed products and 25% on finished goods being imported into most of COMESA's member countries - lower than the taxes in place in many African nations. But not all COMESA's 20 members were prepared to join quickly, despite endorsing the deal, and some may never take part. \n\n  Still, COMESA's outgoing chairman, President Ismael Omar Guelleh of Djibouti, said the union would lead to more foreign investment and \"deeper integration into the world economy.\" \n\n  Established 12 years ago, COMESA represents about 390 million people and has an estimated gross domestic product of $200 billion.

Twelve-month rolling inflation reached 6.26% at the end of April, well above the central bank's target for 2007 of between 3.5% and 4.5%. The bank reiterated at Friday's meeting that it is maintaining the same target. \n\n  \"Inflation is clearly outside the target and inflation expectations are deteriorating fast,\" Goldman Sachs said in a research report before the decision. \n\n  JPMorgan said it expects another rate hike in June and wouldn't rule out further hikes if inflation and inflationary expectations don't show signs of easing by the end of June. \n\n  Barclays Capital sees a similar hike at the bank's June meeting, \"after which we expect the central bank to pause,\" it said. \"The April spike in inflation to 6.26% makes a total of 50 basis points in hikes in the short term very likely,\" Barclays said. \"Nonetheless, the worst of the inflation surprises is likely behind us.\" \n\n  All three banks had forecasted a 25-basis-point increase. \n\n  Speaking after the decision, central bank governor Jose Dario Uribe said the 275 basis points of rate hikes since April 2006 will soon start to quell price pressures. \n\n  Uribe urged the central government to reduce spending, which would also help curb inflation. \"I reiterate that an austere fiscal policy will improve the efficiency of the Colombian economy,\" Uribe said. \n\n  Finance Minister Oscar Ivan Zuluaga said the government expects to end the year with total debt of 147 trillion Colombian pesos ($74.2 billion), unchanged from last year. \"Our spending is not increasing,\" Zuluaga said. \n\n  The central bank, meanwhile, said it believes measures it introduced May 6 will begin to take effect and contribute to promoting its monetary policy. The bank imposed higher reserve requirements on bank deposits and required 40% of the proceeds from foreign loans to be deposited with the Central Bank for six months without interest. The bank also limited the amounts banks and brokerages can invest in derivatives and hedging operations. \n\n  \"Next week, we will evaluate how the measures have slowed down the flow of capital inflows,\" Zuluaga added. \n\n  But the bank didn't take any steps to try to influence the currency at Friday's meeting. Rising interest rates, coupled with strong export revenue and heavy foreign direct investment, have driven the peso higher against the U.S. dollar, and some analysts had expected action to offset Friday's interest rate hike. \n\n  Zuluaga, who sits on the Central Bank board, stressed the sharp appreciation comes from foreign direct investment and not from short-term portfolio investments. \n\n  Late Friday, the Colombian peso was stronger against the U.S. dollar in New York trading, at COP1,979 per U.S. dollar, from COP1,985 earlier. The currency has gained around 13% against the dollar so far this year. \n\n  The sharp appreciation of the peso has already left 15,000 people without jobs in the textile industry and a 6,000 jobs in the flower industry, according to Zuluaga. \n\n  Zuluaga said the government will announce a subsidy package to help exporters early next week. \n\n \n\n  -By Diana Delgado, Dow Jones Newswires; 57-1-600-1980; diana.delgado@dowjones.com (Matthew Cowley in New York contributed to this report.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 18, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248155Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248160Z", "inner_id": 265, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5634, "annotations": [{"id": 4504, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "OBN1gQajC1", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.341827Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.341833Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 105.274, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "5ba4b3e3-bfde-4ccf-a856-1a12aa567dd3", "import_id": 375, "last_action": null, "task": 5634, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "US Stocks Rise On Tame Inflation Data; GM, McDonald&apos;s Gain\n\n \n   By Joanna Ossinger \n   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE \n \n\n  Stocks surged Tuesday amid tame inflation data that bolstered Wall Street's hopes for an interest-rate cut in the near future. \n\n  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 122 to 13469. The S&P 500 added 9 to 1512, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 8 to 2554. \n\n  Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by more than two to one. \n\n  \"I read [the CPI data] as very bullish for the economy,\" said Timothy Rogers, chief economist at Briefing.com. \"I suspect that the reasons for the Fed to tighten [interest rates] have largely disappeared.\" \n\n  Early Tuesday, the Labor Department said the April consumer price index rose 0.4%, but the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced just 0.2%. The data, which largely matched Wall Street forecasts for a 0.5% CPI increase and 0.2% core rise, suggest inflation remains tame. That reinforced a growing belief among investors that Federal Reserve policy makers will cut rates later this year; Rogers expects a quarter-point drop in the fourth quarter. \n\n  Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and spur investment, so hopes for lower rates tend to boost stocks. However, they can also fuel inflation, which until recently was outside of the Fed's comfort zone. Now that price growth seems to have slowed, the Fed may feel freer to soften its vigilant stance on inflation, and perhaps even cut rates. \n\n  The Dow went on a tear after the CPI data came out, bolstered by a gain of 3.7% from General Motors and a 2.2% rise from McDonald's, among others. Amid strong global growth, Wall Street is starting to see large-cap companies as more attractive than small caps, a trend magnified in recent days by a mature bull run that has investors buying into the safety of blue chips. Tuesday midday, 25 of 30 Dow components were trading higher. \n\n  Wal-Mart reported an 8.1% increase in first-quarter net income amid gains abroad and at its Sam's Club chain, even as its namesake stores saw lower same-store sales, or sales in stores open a year or more. The world's largest retailer said second-quarter earnings may miss analysts' expectations. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.2%. \n\n  Home Depot's profit fell 30% in the first quarter, as the No. 1 U.S. home-improvement retailer continued to struggle amid a weak housing demand. Revenue fell 0.6% to $21.59 billion from $21.46 billion a year earlier and same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, dropped 7.6%. Home Depot shares fell 0.3%. \n\n  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke about credit derivatives Tuesday at the Atlanta Fed's financial markets conference. He didn't address the economy or monetary policy. \n\n  DaimlerChrysler said its net income more than doubled, as the Mercedes group swung to a profit, even as its U.S. unit saw its losses widen on a restructuring plan. The stock added 2.6%. \n\n  Thomson and Reuters Group agreed on terms for a merger valued at more than $17 billion in cash and stock, cinching a deal that the two news and data providers outlined earlier this month. Reuters's shares rose 4.2%. \n\n  Amgen shares fell 5.1% after the government's Medicare program proposed limiting payments for the use of anti-anemia drugs based on safety concerns. \n\n  Agilent Technologies rose 4.5% after its current quarter earnings per share and revenue outlook topped analyst estimates. \n\n  Crude-oil futures rose 52 cents to $62.98 a barrel. \n\n \n   In major market action: \n \n\n  Stocks rose. On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday,2,180 stocks gained and 922 declined, on volume of 637 million shares traded on the exchange. \n\n  Bonds fell.

The index widened significantly overnight, opening more than 10 basis points wider from its 267.5 basis points close Monday. \n\n  The Europe Main index of 125 investment-grade names also widened to 29.5/29.75 basis points from its 28/29 opening level. The index hit its widest point of 30 basis points early Tuesday, amid \"good volumes of protection buying all morning,\" said a European credit strategist. \n\n  Single names moved slightly wider with the market Tuesday, but saw no real moves as worries about systemic risk grabbed the attention. \n\n  \"All investment-grade single names are marked one to two basis points weaker, but all the concentration is on the indexes this morning,\" said a trader. \n\n  The primary market seems to be in wait-and-see mode given the recent market volatility. A rise in the level of risk-aversion means that investors are now demanding a higher premium to hold risk, which is driving up the cost of funding. \n\n  Late Monday, Russian state-controlled oil producer OAO Rosneft postponed its two-tranche Eurobond issue according to the deal's lead managers. \n\n  Rosneft had been preparing to issue up to $5 billion of debt to refinance recent acquisitions, and bankers familiar with the matter had said it wanted to issue $2 billion-equivalent of Eurobonds in separate tranches and currencies, with maturities of five and 10 years. \n\n  Rosneft is looking to refinance part of the $22 billion of debt it took on to buy most of the assets of OAO Yukos at the company's liquidation earlier this year. \n\n \n\n  -By Michael Wilson, Dow Jones Newswires; 44 20 7842 9349; michael.wilson@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 17, 2007 07:46 ET (11:46 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248393Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248398Z", "inner_id": 273, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5642, "annotations": [{"id": 4512, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "_OzHwAWf2j", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342062Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342067Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 45.808, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "c038b7a3-5d6e-4472-b75a-751b15703654", "import_id": 383, "last_action": null, "task": 5642, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Forex Focus: Euro Support May Grow As Oil Prices Rally\n\n \n\n  By Nicholas Hastings \n\n  A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN \n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Expect the euro to keep on climbing against the dollar. \n\n  With oil prices rising, money supply growing and labor markets tightening, the European Central Bank's concern about inflation could step up a notch, even though current inflation levels in the euro zone remain subdued. \n\n  This is likely to contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The announcement helped widen risk premiums in credit markets and added to declines in stock markets and the dollar. The move was also strong enough to force the 10-year yield decisively below 5% and to its lowest level since early June. \n\n  Friday afternoon, the 10-year Treasury was up 19/32 for a 4.95% yield, while the long bond was up 28/32 for 5.06%. The two-year note was up 4/32 for 4.78%. \n\n  \"The fundamentals are going to continue to take a backstage...unless there's some really good news\" in next Friday's gross domestic product data, said George Goncalves, chief Treasury, TIPS and agency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. \"Investors are in this risk reduction mode and so long as that's the case, I wouldn't want to stand in the way of the price action.\" \n\n  The market's focus on the impact of subprime - home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories - was given sharper focus this week by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. While the Fed has consistently argued that the economic impact of the subprime market's struggles has so far been contained, Bernanke cited estimates to senators Thursday that suggested the subprime-related credit losses could amount to between $50 billion and $100 billion. Frequent speculation of subprime related losses at U.S. and overseas banks or hedge funds have kept investors jittery. \n\n  Goncalves said with the full picture unlikely to become clear for some time, the subprime story could continue to subdue Treasury yields - keeping them well below the Fed's 5.25% target funds rate. \n\n  \"I think we'll stay at these richer levels next week,\" he said, adding that the yield curve should steepen as shorter-term Treasurys see the biggest bid. \n\n \n    Growth, Housing Data Top The Bill \n \n\n  For Andrew Richman, managing director at SunTrust Personal Asset Management with around $8 billion in fixed income assets under management, \"there's certainly fear\" that the subprime story could spread to the prime market and have a sharper impact on fixed income assets. \n\n  Given the jitters, he said the 10-year yield could easily fall toward 4.85% in the days ahead. However, he believes the subprime story will ultimately be contained and thinks Treasurys are likely settling into a 4.85%-5.25% range. \n\n  \"Yields already don't look that attractive\" at Friday's sub-5% levels. \"We'd opportunistically take advantage\" to sell when the 10-year yield falls to 4.85% and buy when it tops 5.20%, he said. \n\n  If anything will pressure Treasury prices lower and yields higher next week, it's likely to be the GDP data. The economy is expected to have expanded 3.2% in the second quarter, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Annualized first quarter growth was 0.7%. \n\n  John Miller, head of funds management at Nuveen Asset Management, said the report should provide \"a vote of confidence in the diversity and broad-based resilience of the economy.\" However, he acknowledged that with expectations for the number already high and some concerns that the economy's \"momentum could be waning a little bit in the second half of the year,\" investors' reaction to the data could be subdued. \n\n  The other major data next week are housing numbers, with June existing home sales seen falling to an annualized 5.90 million from 5.99 million in May when it's reported Wednesday. On Thursday, new home sales are expected at an annualized 900,000 from 915,000 in May. \n\n  Again however, Miller said that with the weak housing story well absorbed by markets, the data will largely \"reinforce concerns that are already out there.\" \n\n  Next week also sees several Treasury Department auctions, with the government selling $6 billion in reopened 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities on Tuesday. There are also two- and five-year Treasurys auctions. \n\n  SunTrust's Richman said that with buyers currently active, the sales \"should go fairly well,\" although with the bigger subprime story dominating the headlines, \"I don't see tremendous upside or downside risk\" for the market from the auctions. \n\n  -By Laurence Norman, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2096; laurence.norman@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 22, 2007 18:00 ET (22:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248454Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248460Z", "inner_id": 275, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5644, "annotations": [{"id": 4514, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "Ny6oSaatex", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342120Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342126Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 92.436, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "decb0688-7ae5-4cf4-a237-bd7ab2e46d67", "import_id": 385, "last_action": null, "task": 5644, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Vietnam Preliminary July CPI +8.39% On Yr, +0.94% On Month\n\n \n\n  HANOI (Dow Jones)--Vietnam's consumer price index is projected to have risen 8.39% in July from the same month last year, due mainly to higher food and housing costs, government data issued Tuesday showed. \n\n  The index is expected to have risen 0.94% from June, based on preliminary data, the Government Statistics Office said. \n\n  A Ministry of Agriculture official said food prices were higher because Vietnam's key winter-spring rice crop produced only 17.1 million tons of paddy rice, down 3% on year. \n\n  Bird flu and bacterial infections among pigs have also hurt many farmers across the country, resulting in higher prices for foodstuffs in many provinces in Vietnam, the official said. \n\n  Food and food services prices are expected to have climbed 11.13% on year and 1.59% on month.

Standard & Poor's GSCI Excess Return Index, which measures the price movements of eight agriculture commodities -- including wheat, sugar and corn -- is up 10% in the past year. \n\n  European shoppers are looking at some particularly stiff increases. Germany's Dairy Industry Association said earlier this month that domestic prices for milk-based products such as butter could jump as much as 50% this year. Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever said soaring global edible-oil and dairy prices will increase its costs by more than 600 million euros ($821.8 million) this year and boost prices for products such as margarine. Italy's Association of Pasta Manufacturers said last month that a durum-wheat squeeze will increase domestic pasta prices by 20% this fall. \n\n  While food-price inflation in many major economies has accelerated, the impact in the 13 countries that share the euro currency has been muted so far. Annual euro-zone food-price inflation was 2.1% in June, compared with 4.8% in the United Kingdom and 4.1% in the U.S. In Japan, where other prices keep falling, the annual inflation rate for food excluding perishables was 0.3% in June. Japan's Q.P. Corp., for instance, lifted mayonnaise prices for businesses and consumers by about 10% in June. \n\n  Some economists say the strong euro has shielded the euro zone from some price increases. Most food commodities are priced in dollars, so a stronger euro makes those products cheaper for European buyers. The euro has risen nearly 4% against the dollar since the start of the year and now hovers near record highs around $1.37. And in contrast to the U.K., where a strong pound also damps commodity-price inflation, euro-zone consumer demand has been relatively weak, deterring producers and supermarkets from raising prices. \n\n  That is changing. \"Euro-zone growth has picked up and is therefore increasing the pricing power of retailers,\" says Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. Mr. Nielsen notes that falling unemployment could boost domestic consumption across the bloc. Rising food prices could be particularly relevant for the European Central Bank and borrowers across the continent. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB, which sets euro-zone monetary policy, focuses on \"headline\" inflation -- that is, inflation with volatile food and energy costs included. That has some fretting that the bloc's inflation rate will rise further than expected. \n\n  \"We're concerned,\" says Nick Matthews, economist with Barclays Capital in London. Mr. Matthews expects inflation to hit 2.4% later this year, above the ECB's 2% ceiling, and says higher food prices could bump the rate up further. \n\n  Before last week's global credit crunch, which prompted the ECB to pump 213.6 billion euros into euro-zone money markets, most economists expected the bank to raise interest rates to 4.25% in September from 4%, as inflation pressures, including rising energy costs and robust economic growth, mount. \n\n  But if market turbulence continues and the ECB keeps injecting money into the system, a September rate increase is less likely. \n\n  While food prices are rising across the bloc, Germans may feel a particular pinch. German dairy farmers have paid heavy fines -- 134 million euros in 2005 -- for ignoring EU milk-production quotas but now largely produce within legal limits, a change that is squeezing supply. \n\n  Particularly slack domestic demand has also kept retail prices low. Last year, German prices for milk, cheese and eggs were just 87% of the EU average. \"Germany, in particular, has room to catch up,\" says Barclays's Mr. Matthews. But rising prices there \"reflect supply pressures across the board,\" he says. \n\n  Overall, the factors pushing up euro-zone food prices mirror the dynamics at work globally. The push to use some crops to produce biofuels is one culprit; changing weather patterns are another. Australia's continuing drought means farmers there can't fulfill as many orders. European farmers are stepping in, particularly to meet milk-product demand. \n\n  Fast growth and changing palates in developing countries are also to blame. Germany is by far the EU's largest dairy producer, and its milk-product exports -- from whey powder to soft cheese -- to Eastern Europe, developing Asia and oil-producing countries has skyrocketed. The value of German milk and cream exports to Hungary rose to 29 million euros last year from 1.6 million euros in 2002; the value of whey-powder exports to China over the same period jumped to 5.5 million euros from 247,000 euros. \n\n  Economists expect global demand to keep climbing, as developing-market consumers continue shifting their eating habits from basics like bread to fare such as cheese and meat. Until those countries develop the capacity to meet their own demand, economists say prices will continue to rise. \n\n  The food-price jump has already prompted the EU to cut some subsidies. For years, high labor and production costs have kept European dairy prices above those in the rest of the world. \n\n  In response, the EU used to offer dairy farmers refunds to make up the difference on products they exported at lower prices. In 2004, those refunds totaled 1.5 billion euros. With global prices rising, the EU started phasing out the program last year. \n\n  For Europe, economists say, it is the dawn of a new era. \"Suddenly, there's a factor that was never visible in the domestic market,\" says Stefan Tangermann, director for food, agriculture and fisheries at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \"That is: What do the Chinese eat?\" \n\n  --- \n\n  Yuka Hayashi in Tokyo contributed to this article. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 12, 2007 19:51 ET (23:51 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248518Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248523Z", "inner_id": 277, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5646, "annotations": [{"id": 4516, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "Aw8nPwxszP", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342178Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342183Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 97.18, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "c290c23a-64e8-4ad1-bed4-b7bb068af199", "import_id": 387, "last_action": null, "task": 5646, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Ecuador Aims To Boost Oil Export Revenues -Petroecuador Exec\n\n \n\n  (This article was originally published Wednesday) \n\n \n   By Mercedes Alvaro \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  QUITO (Dow Jones)--Ecuador has started testing markets to try and improve revenues from oil exports, and isn't ruling out a change in the way it prices crude oil sales, a high-level official with state-owned Petroecuador said Wednesday. \n\n  \"We want to be closer to the market so that buyers have the possibility to buy under the best conditions. We are now carrying out spot sales. We could also make contracts for two or three months with a fixed discount, including changing the benchmark,\" Petroecuador's manager of international trade, Carlos Izurieta, told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \n\n  Izurieta said that among the oil benchmarks they could choose from are Maya from Mexico and Merey from Venezuela. \n\n  \"But this will depend on the next months of monitoring the market. As of now, we are trying to and will continue to try to capture what the market is quoting in order to optimize our profits,\" he said. \n\n  Izurieta added that the state has begun monitoring the effects of spot sales since May with Napo crude oil, from Occidental Oil Company's (OXY) former fields, and since July with Oriente crude. \n\n  Petroecuador already said that it has stopped using the formula that includes the discount fixed by Platts and Argus, plus a premium offered by the company interested in the oil. \n\n  Now the buyer must directly offer a discount on West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, and the crude is awarded to those who offer the lowest discount. Ecuadorian crude is heavier than the WTI benchmark, and sells at a discount. \n\n  It will take six months of market analysis before a decision on pricing is made, he said. \n\n  Meanwhile, Petroecuador continues to negotiate with oil refineries in Peru, Costa Rica and Chile to sign long-term contracts, for 14,000, 6,000 and 24,000 barrels a day of Oriente, respectively. \n\n  In July, Petroecuador spot sold 400,000 barrels to Chile \"as part of what could be a long-term relationship, in which we are discussing prices, including what part intermediaries take. We are analyzing what are the greatest factors that affect the price.\" \n\n  Izurieta said one idea would be to fix the price, but to have adjustments every two or three months according to market conditions and factors that the two parties agree upon. \n\n  As part of the new marketing policy, this past week Petroecuador called a meeting to sell 19 shipments of 360,000 barrels of Oriente oil that would be shipped between September and October. The offer's outcome will be known on Thursday. \n\n  Ecuador exports some 120,000 barrels of Oriente oil a day, with an API grade of 23.5 and a sulfur level of 1.5%. \n\n  Additionally, it exports 40,000 barrels a day of Napo, and Ecuador has an agreement with Venezuela to exchange 22,000 barrels a day of Napo crude for Venezuelan oil derivatives. \n\n  Although Ecuador produces around 504,000 barrels a day, it doesn't have sufficient capacity to cover internal demand for oil derivatives. \n\n \n\n  -By Mercedes Alvaro, Dow Jones Newswires; 5939-9728-653; mercedes.alvaro@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 02, 2007 07:33 ET (11:33 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248548Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248553Z", "inner_id": 278, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5647, "annotations": [{"id": 4517, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "UYSHwabpTk", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342206Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342211Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 244.818, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "7e39eb82-4eaa-4594-b56f-a0469f7e25c5", "import_id": 388, "last_action": null, "task": 5647, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Barron&apos;s(8/6) Commodities Corner: Exports Show Flour Power\n\n   (From BARRON'S) \n   By Tom Polansek \n\n  Countries hungry for wheat don't have many options on the menu of global suppliers these days, forcing many to order from the U.S. despite steep prices. \n\n  But this recent export boom could come to an end soon if importers back away from the table after front-loading their purchases. There's also the risk that end users will lose their appetites if prices climb too high. \n\n  The U.S. has profited from big export sales recently because few other major wheat-producing countries have surpluses of grain to sell. Weather has caused crop losses in several key growing areas of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and the Black Sea region, and the Southern Hemisphere won't harvest its wheat until fall. \n\n  Some U.S. wheat growers suffered this spring from rains in the Southern Plains. But in the Northern Plains, crops of hard-red spring wheat, used for bread, and durum wheat, for pasta, are in above-average condition ahead of harvest. \n\n  And up to now, the weak dollar has done its bit to attract foreign grain buyers. \n\n  In the week ended July 19, the U.S. racked up its highest export sales of wheat since June 1996, according to the Agriculture Department. Some of the buying countries weren't names that pop up frequently; Bangladesh, for example, made its first purchase of U.S. hard-red-winter wheat since the 1999-2000 marketing season. \n\n  The strong sales weren't just a one-time bonanza, either. Last week's business was robust, too. \n\n  \"The end users overseas are locking in grain because they absolutely, positively have to have it,\" says Dave Marshall, a commodities broker and independent marketing adviser in Nashville, Ill. \"Where else can they get it right now?\" \n\n  Sales continue strong even though wheat futures are trading at their highest prices in more than a decade. Chicago Board of Trade September wheat ended at $6.50 per bushel Friday, down 31/4 cents on the week, but up from $3.96 a year ago. \"It's been most impressive how these exports have held up,\" declares Jason Britt, a broker and analyst with Central State Commodities in Kansas City, Mo. \n\n  Some traders argue export sales have reached an \"unsustainable pace\" and will have to drop off eventually. One theory is that importers have engaged in a bit of fear buying and are just covering their wheat needs until Australia and Argentina harvest their crops. \n\n  Prices also could reach a pain threshold for end users that would cause a reduction in demand. Sentimentwise, \"you'd probably get people really anxious if you get wheat to the $7 mark,\" says Dale Durchholz, senior analyst with AgriVisor in Bloomington, Ill. \n\n  Britt, on the other hand, isn't so sure that even reaching that psychologically important price level would be the breaking point for end users. With historically tight global supplies, it's hard to put a price level on hunger, he observes. \n\n  \"People still have to eat,\" he says. \n\n  Nymex crude-oil touched an intraday record high Wednesday of $78.70 a barrel -- but the September contract settled Friday at $75.48, notching down $1.54 on the week. \n\n  --- \n\n  Tom Polansek is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in Chicago. \n\n  --- \n\n  --- \n\n  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 04, 2007 00:07 ET (04:07 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248585Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248591Z", "inner_id": 279, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5648, "annotations": [{"id": 4518, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "divEsUtiuV", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342232Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342237Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 841.483, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "3c5fd585-31fe-4074-834b-c13c2475f022", "import_id": 389, "last_action": null, "task": 5648, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "S Korea July Producer Prices +0.2% On Month, +2.4% On Year\n\n \n\n  SEOUL (Dow Jones)--South Korean producer prices rose last month, largely because of a rise in service charges and prices of manufactured goods, the Bank of Korea said Thursday. \n\n  The producer price index climbed 0.2% from June as increased commission charges in the wake of a booming stock market pushed up services charges while higher international oil costs and petroleum product costs boosted the prices of manufactured goods, the central bank said. \n\n  On year, the index gained 2.4%, compared with a 2.7% increase in June.

Hagerty and Ken Gepfert \n\n  FULLERTON, Calif. -- Nearly two years ago, Mario and Leticia Montes found a home they loved, a gray stucco bungalow with a hot tub in the backyard in a middle-class neighborhood of Orange County. \n\n  The price was a major stretch at $567,000. But the couple, who had sold a home a few years earlier to move to a better area, were tired of renting. Mr. and Mrs. Montes convened a meeting with their two teenage daughters around the kitchen table to hash out the implications. \"We agreed we wanted to be homeowners again,\" says Mr. Montes, \"even if it meant the end of vacations and not eating out as often.\" \n\n  Like many people who jumped into the rising housing market in recent years, they had little money for a down payment and chose a loan that would hold their monthly payments down for the first two years, then \"reset\" to a much higher level. Mr. and Mrs. Montes say their mortgage broker assured them they would be able to refinance in a couple of years to keep their payments affordable. \n\n  With a December \"reset\" on their loan looming, however, the refinancing option now looks impossible. A friend who works as a loan officer called with some bad news this week: Similar homes in their area have been selling for $535,000 to $565,000 recently. That means the Monteses' loan balance may exceed the value of their home. \n\n  The Monteses are caught in a trap -- one that hundreds of thousands of people could face as the housing market totters and the easy credit of recent years dries up. They in effect bet that the boom in housing prices would continue. It was more important to hop onto the escalator than to wait until they could afford to make the leap according to traditional measures. \n\n  And with thousands of mortgage banks and brokers threatened with extinction, lenders that embraced all kinds of risky loans two years ago are enforcing increasingly strict standards. They are refusing even to consider extending new credit to people like the Monteses who lack any equity in their homes. \n\n  \"We have a disaster on our hands,\" says Mr. Montes, a 48-year-old warehouse manager. He fears he won't be able to handle the payments after the December reset and wonders whether the family can avert foreclosure. \"At this point,\" he says, \"we really don't have a plan.\" \n\n  Until recently, the Montes family didn't seem like the type that would find itself faced with foreclosure. They live in a solid neighborhood and are both employed and in good health. \"My wife and I make pretty good money,\" says Mr. Montes. Mrs. Montes works as a school secretary. Together, they earned nearly $90,000 last year. \n\n  But they already pay about $38,400 a year on their home loans, even before taxes and insurance. In December, when their primary loan \"resets\" to a higher rate, that cost will rise to about $50,000 a year, Mr. Montes says. \n\n  Lenders have been tightening their standards for the past year in the face of rising defaults and growing jitters among the investors who provide funding for loans. That tightening has accelerated in the past two weeks as many lenders -- uncertain at what price they might be able to sell loans -- have stopped making all but the safest ones. \n\n  \"It's getting worse and worse,\" says Jeff Lazerson, chief executive of Mortgage Grader, a mortgage broker in Laguna Niguel, who tried to help the Montes family last spring but concluded even then that they couldn't qualify for a new loan. Many people who have been counting on a refinancing to ease their debt burdens will find that's now impossible, he says: \"It's either work 24 hours a day to make ends meet [with the existing loan] or mail the keys back to the bank.\" \n\n  Being stuck with little or no home equity is no longer a rare situation. Christopher Cagan, director of research at First American CoreLogic, a housing and mortgage data supplier in Santa Ana, recently found that nearly 7% of 32 million U.S. households studied as of December owed more than their homes were worth, based on computer estimates of the property values. An additional 4% had home equity of 5% or less. Since then, house prices have edged down in much of the country, erasing more home equity. \n\n  Without a cushion of equity, homeowners are vulnerable to losing their homes to foreclosure if they suddenly are out of work, suffer a serious illness or, like the Montes family, face a jump in mortgage payments. \n\n  Partly as a result, foreclosures are surging. Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., projects that lenders will acquire about 760,000 homes through foreclosure this year and 935,000 in 2008, up from an average of about 440,000 a year from 2000 through 2006. \n\n  When the Monteses decided to buy the bungalow in 2005, they had only a so-so credit record and little savings. So they settled for a \"subprime\" loan, with costlier terms than those available in the prime market. \n\n  The Monteses' primary loan is the type that became the dominant subprime mortgage during the housing boom of the first half of this decade -- and now has become a symbol of misguided lending, swept away by regulatory fiat and investors' flight from mortgages deemed too risky. These loans are known in the trade as 2/28 mortgages. The interest rate is fixed at a relatively low rate for the first two years (5.45% in the Monteses' case), then floats at a predetermined margin above an interest-rate index for the next 28 years. In many cases, that \"reset\" of the interest rate after two years leads to a monthly payment increase of 30% or more. \n\n  U.S. lenders originated about $600 billion of subprime home loans in 2006, or 20% of all home mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. About 56% of those subprime loans were 2/28 mortgages, says Keith Ernst, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit research and lobbying group in Durham, N.C. \n\n  The lending industry touted the 2/28 loans as \"affordability\" mortgages, because they helped people buy houses that wouldn't have been affordable with the higher immediate payments on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. To make the loans even more affordable in the early years, they were often structured as \"interest-only,\" meaning that principal payments were deferred until later. \n\n  Lenders sometimes described these loans as \"credit-repair tools.\" The idea was that people with blemished credit records could take out a 2/28 subprime loan and keep up with the payments long enough to improve their credit records and qualify for a less-costly prime loan. \n\n  Earlier this year, regulators ordered subprime lenders to make such loans based on the borrower's ability to afford the loan after the reset, not just for the initial two years, as was the common practice. That change, along with tighter guidelines from rating agencies and risk-aversion among investors, has recently prompted major subprime lenders to stop making 2/28 loans. Instead, they are making more subprime loans that carry a fixed rate for at least five years, as well as ones that hold down payments by stretching the payments over 40 years instead of 30. \n\n  The Montes family got their loan through a mortgage broker in Rancho Cucamonga. Using what was then a common formula, the broker offered to arrange for two loans, one to cover about 80% of the home price and the other, a so-called piggyback loan, for the rest. For the first two years, their total monthly mortgage payments are about $3,200. The loans are interest-only. \n\n  Mr. Montes recalls feeling edgy about whether he would be able to afford the higher costs -- about $900 more per month -- due to take effect after two years. But he says the broker assured him he could refinance before those costs kicked in. \n\n  Mr. Montes preferred not to name the broker publicly because the broker has a business connection with a relative of the Monteses. The broker declined to comment. \n\n  Mrs. Montes says she was apprehensive about the broker's assurances. \"But I blame that on that I don't understand the lingo they were talking,\" she says. \"It's a scary experience. . . . All I could see was all these numbers flash before me. . . . I said, 'Mario, I hope you don't get into something that is going to hurt us.'\" \n\n  They moved into their home and hung a sign on the front door reading, \"Life is a daily celebration of love.\" Within months, things started going wrong. The Monteses received a letter informing them their property taxes had been reassessed based on the $567,000 sale price instead of its previous $389,000 value. That raised their taxes to $6,000 from $2,900 a year and would have increased their monthly payments (including the mortgages and taxes) to $3,931. \"Whoa!\" Mr. Montes recalls saying. \"I can't afford this. I went into emergency mode.\" \n\n  He was able to successfully challenge part of the tax increase, but another shock came in late February of this year when he began looking at refinancing possibilities. Mr. Montes says four brokers -- including the one who arranged the original loan -- turned him away, saying it wouldn't be possible to refinance because, with home prices flat at best, the family had little or no equity in the home. Worse for the Monteses, they learned that they faced a $12,000 prepayment penalty if they refinanced within three years of the original mortgages -- something that Mr. Montes says wasn't made clear to him when he took out those loans. \n\n  Then another broker told him in March that his home had gained enough in value for him to qualify for a more affordable loan. They paid for an appraisal and were told their home was worth $620,000, or about $53,000 more than they paid in 2005. The Monteses were jubilant, thinking their home was saved. But more than three months later, the broker outlined a package that would have involved payments far higher than indicated in earlier meetings. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 15, 2007 23:05 ET (03:05 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248656Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248662Z", "inner_id": 281, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5650, "annotations": [{"id": 4520, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "LhlhZyVhNJ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342286Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T13:34:18.321245Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 616.431, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "206b0653-a2c8-47c2-92dd-7e0c61eef2d6", "import_id": 391, "last_action": null, "task": 5650, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(9/29) China Will Moderately Tighten Monetary Policy\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n\n  BEIJING -- China's central bank on Friday said it will continue to moderately tighten monetary policy amid inflation pressures, even as it closely monitors the potential impact of U.S. subprime-mortgage problems on global financial markets and China itself. \n\n  The comments, in a summary of the People's Bank of China's third-quarter monetary-policy-board meeting, highlight that Beijing is weighing the risk of a domestic economic slowdown because of problems in the U.S. financial sector against the imperative to prevent China's economy from overheating, including curbing consumer-price and asset-price inflation. \n\n  At the moment, the PBOC's focus remains mainly on the domestic economy, and in the summary it said it \"will continue to implement a monetary policy with a moderate tightening bias.\" \n\n  The summary, posted on the PBOC's Web site, comes after the August consumer-price index surged 6.5% from a year earlier, the fastest gain in more than 10 years, and as prices in the local share market reach records, raising the risk that an asset bubble might be forming. \n\n  China's growth in its gross domestic product is likely to continue its fast clip in the second half, bringing GDP growth for the year to 11.6% and the inflation rate to 4.6%, a report by PBOC researchers said Friday. \n\n  The PBOC in the summary said it needs to analyze the reasons behind the \"relatively fast\" rises in consumer and asset prices.

But this year, there are some significant differences, triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable. \n\n  One main distinction: This time around, the economy isn't looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults. \n\n  In addition, in 2006, oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil, which meant energy buyers had a stockpile. By contrast, today, different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions. \n\n  That's troublesome, because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers -- oil refiners and speculators alike -- to quickly bid up crude-oil prices beyond $80 a barrel, just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession. \n\n  Indeed, oil stockpiles have continued to drain quickly as prices for \"spot,\" or today's-price, oil far outpace prices for delivery a few months from now. Yesterday, the Energy Information Administration reported a higher-than-expected reduction in crude inventories last week. \n\n  Yesterday, after hitting $80.18 in intraday trading, the New York Mercantile Exchange's crude-futures contract settled at $79.91, up $1.68, or 2.1%. While that is an exchange record, oil has been higher in inflation-adjusted terms: The inflation-adjusted record is $101.57, hit in April 1980. \n\n  News yesterday that the Houston Ship Channel, which serves five refineries and multiple chemical plants, closed ahead of Tropical Storm Humberto also helped propel prices. \n\n  But clues that oil could touch $80 surfaced the day before, when markets rallied even after an announced production boost from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Many observers perceived the 500,000-barrel-a-day rise as stingy in the face of growing demand. \n\n  \"The idea of OPEC bringing on just 500,000 barrels a day, and not until November, is like Ben Bernanke saying maybe we should lower interest rates 1/10th of 1%: It has no relevance,\" said Matt Simmons of Simmons & Co., an energy investment bank in Houston, and author of a controversial book contending Saudi oil reserves are less prolific than claimed. \n\n  In addition, it takes an estimated two months for extra tankers to reach the U.S. from the Middle East. \n\n  \"We believe the door to $80 and beyond remains open and beckons,\" said Barclays energy analysts Paul Horsnell and Kevin Norrish in a note yesterday. \n\n  The big question is what impact $80 oil prices will have on the economy. Some oil-field services stocks rallied, but other stocks sank, including airlines that get socked by higher jet-fuel prices. \n\n  Even refiners could get hurt, the Barclays analysts pointed out: Gasoline inventories are within a hair of their lowest levels since 2000, and profits from converting oil to fuel shrink with higher crude prices. \n\n  If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, as it is expected to do next week, that could weaken the dollar and give oil-producing organizations further excuses to try to keep prices high, since they will be getting paid in less-valuable dollars, argues Larry Goldstein, director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, an industry-funded, nonprofit research organization. \n\n  Canadian oil producers could be winners if oil prices stay high and the U.S. needs more crude quickly. Heavy-oil-sands projects are profitable at today's oil prices, and producers could ship more down to the Midwest, as more refineries start to retool their plants to process the heavy stuff. \n\n  But the U.S. can't absorb and use this heavy crude all that quickly, because there still are limited pipelines that can get it to the Gulf Coast refining centers, and many refineries both in the Midwest and near the Gulf still can't take it. \n\n  Other commodity markets provide ominous clues. Copper markets, for example, have typically been sensitive to U.S. recessions and housing slowdowns, because the metal is used in housing products, electric supplies and electronics. But such a large percentage of consumption has shifted to Asia that analysts are suggesting copper inventories are likely to start dropping again after a seasonal slowdown, whether or not the U.S. is using more of it, and prices could rise. Oil may do the same thing. \n\n  In other commodity markets: \n\n \n\n  NATURAL GAS: Futures shot up 8.7%, driven by fears that Atlantic tropical storms could disrupt Gulf of Mexico energy production. Near-month October natural gas on the Nymex rose 51.3 cents to $6.438 a million British thermal units. \n\n \n\n  SOYBEANS: Futures at the Chicago Board of Trade rose on supportive crop-production data, pushing prices to their highest level since 2004. Nearby September soybeans gained 20 cents to $9.25. \n\n \n\n  WHEAT: CBOT prices fell, with some contracts falling to the daily price limit of 30 cents. Nearby September fell 31 cents to $8.40 a bushel; because the contract is in delivery, price limits were removed. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 12, 2007 23:00 ET (03:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248749Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T13:37:47.669921Z", "inner_id": 284, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5653, "annotations": [{"id": 4523, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "xJFAtFAWIK", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342368Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342374Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 144.843, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "8110b24e-9024-44a3-aed9-4c1d9ab084dd", "import_id": 394, "last_action": null, "task": 5653, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UPDATE: Mexico 2008 Budget Plan Sees 3.5% GDP Growth In 2008\n\n \n\n  (Updates with details throughout) \n\n \n\n  MEXICO CITY (Dow Jones)-Mexico's Finance Ministry submitted the government's 2008 budget proposal to Congress Saturday, saying it expects gross domestic product to grow 3.5% next year. \n\n  The 2.39 trillion peso ($215 billion) spending proposal is up 3.3% in real terms from the budget approved for 2007, the ministry said. \n\n  The ministry said economic growth could be 3.7% next year if the Congress passes a proposed tax reform, which it estimated would add about MXN115 billion to next year's revenue, with the proceeds being used for investment and social spending. \n\n  In the proposal, the ministry also lowered its economic growth estimate for 2007 to 3% from 3.3%, attributing the lower forecast to an expected slowdown in the U.S. as a result of the recent financial market turmoil and the lack of recovery in the U.S. real estate sector. Mexico's economy grew 4.8% in 2006. \n\n  The ministry estimated that the average price of Mexico's export crude, a significant contributor to government revenue, would be $46.60 a barrel in 2008, with state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, expected to export on average 1.68 million barrels a day of crude oil. \n\n  The ministry estimated that Pemex's export crude will average $54.60 a barrel in 2007, with Pemex exporting 1.73 million barrels a day out of total production of 3.14 million barrels a day. Pemex current crude production is about 3.16 million barrels a day. \n\n  The Congress is close to reaching agreement on a tax reform, although a vote on the bill was delayed last week by disagreements over a plan to raise gasoline and diesel prices, and by lack of agreement among parties on an electoral reform that the three main parties had agreed to pass at the same time as the fiscal reform. \n\n  Finance Minister Agustin Carstens handed in the budget plan in person, urging legislators to pass a tax reform to make for a more effective budget, given the country's spending needs. \n\n  \"This is particularly important faced with a fiscal year in which significant challenges are expected,\" he said. \n\n  In its budget outline, the ministry warned that although the plan projects a balanced budget, the public sector will probably end next year with a deficit as a result of the recent reform of the state workers pension and social security system. The amount will depend on how many workers choose to switch to individual accounts from the existing defined benefits system, and won't be known until next September, the ministry said. \n\n  The short-term transition costs of the pension reform will outweigh immediate savings, although savings in the medium term will change that situation, the ministry said, adding that the executive branch can adjust spending or issue debt to meet the commitments. \n\n  Speaking at a press conference in Australia, President Felipe Calderon said that if a tax reform is approved in the coming days or weeks, the additional revenue could be added to next year's spending plan. He said areas that could benefit from the extra money include road, port, and water infrastructure, higher education, health services, Pemex and state electric utility Comision Federal de Electricidad, according to a transcript from the presidential press office. \n\n  -By Anthony Harrup, Dow Jones Newswires; 5255 5080 3450, anthony.harrup@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 08, 2007 22:07 ET (02:07 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248779Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248784Z", "inner_id": 285, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5654, "annotations": [{"id": 4524, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "tqgaNgchqz", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342397Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342402Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 35.223, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "98d3ceba-106b-4faa-8890-830ca99a5ae6", "import_id": 395, "last_action": null, "task": 5654, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "CHARTING MARKETS: Stock Indexes To Trade Lower Early\n\n   A Dow Jones Newswires Column By Stephen Cox, CMT \n \n              10Y-Note  Euro$    DJIA*    NASDAQ*   S&P*   S&P/TSX* \n               (CBOT)   (CME)              COMP     500 \nNext Resist.   109-23   95.73  14022.00  2712.10  1538.74  14118.70 \nFirst Resist.  109-09   95.66  13951.00  2699.40  1527.54  14025.03 \n \nFirst Support  108-13   95.51  13670.60  2652.30  1496.40  13700.58 \nNext Support   107-29   95.46  13522.60  2644.40  1487.32  13538.98 \n \n               EUR/$    $/Yen    Nikkei    JGB     CRB      Gold     Crude \n                                          (TSE)   Index    (Comex)  (NYMEX) \nNext Resist.   1.4327   116.63   16754    135.43  338.58    752.10   82.33 \nFirst Resist.  1.4222   115.31   16528    135.25  336.42    744.80   81.54 \n \nFirst Support  1.3964   113.96   16176    134.44  332.03    721.10   79.13 \nNext Support   1.3824   112.57   15914    133.92  330.34    699.70   78.82 \n \n\n  *Stock index levels figured on prices near 3 p.m. EDT. \n\n \n\n  T-note: Technical levels for the contract remain unchanged.

It closed Tuesday at 53 basis points, according to Markit, the administrator of the index. \n\n  Cusser said investors such as himself are eager for high-quality bonds issued by companies other than financial institutions. But such deals aren't abundant, and when they get to the market, \"they're getting snapped up,\" he said. \n\n  For instance, a $750 million two-part offering from Clorox was launched and priced quickly Wednesday. And a $300 million, 10-year deal from Florida Power and Light Co. went in about 20 minutes and was 10 times oversubscribed, according to a syndicate source, who added it felt like a deal before the summer credit crunch. \n\n  Cusser said the volume of issuance so far has been \"something of a mirage\" because a lot of it was refinancing older debt from financial institutions. \n\n  Next on the market's watch are several important releases of U.S. economic data: jobless claims data Thursday and the unemployment rate and consumer credit report Friday. Such reports give investors insight into the strength of the economy. \n\n \n\n  U.S. Treasurys \n\n \n\n  Suspicion the labor market may not be in all that much peril gnawed at Treasurys Wednesday, as the market failed to make up the losses sparked by a stronger-than-expected services sector survey. \n\n  All maturities finished a little worse than where they started the session, with the two-year yield at 4%, and the 10-year at 4.55%. \n\n  The impetus behind the selling was the latest Institute for Supply Management report, which showed activity in the dominant services sector grew at a slower pace in September. The drop in the index - from 55.8 to 54.8 - would normally be bond-positive, but the report also pointed to a quickening in inflationary pressures. Its prices index rose to 66.1, from 58.6 the month before. \n\n \n\n  U.S. Agencies \n\n \n\n  Risk premiums on short-term agency debt were tighter Wednesday. Coming in around 2 basis points higher over Treasurys were Freddie Mac's (FRE) 5% issue due 2009 and Federal Home Loan Bank's (FHLB) 4.5% due 2009. \n\n  Risk premiums on longer-term agency paper were little changed, with 30-year paper issued by Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) tightening by less than half a basis point. \n\n \n\n  U.S. Asset-Backed Securities \n\n \n\n   A $2 billion credit-card backed deal dubbed BACCT 2007-A13 has sold at 22 basis points over one-month Libor, according to IFR Asset-Backed Securities.

The move also comes before the 17th Communist Party Congress, China's most important political meeting, opens Monday. \n\n  The timing is likely intended to demonstrate the central bank's quick responsiveness to data and its determination to tighten policy despite the party meeting, a period when stability is key and policy moves aren't expected. \n\n  In a statement on its Web site, the People's Bank of China said it is increasing the ratio to \"strengthen management of liquidity in the banking system and restrain overly rapid growth of credit.\" \n\n  Beijing has been trying to contain surging asset prices and accelerating consumer price inflation, as well as bring economic growth to a more sustainable pace, as China's vast trade surpluses continue to pump liquidity into a domestic financial system already flush with funds. \n\n  Despite increasing its pace of tightening, with five rate hikes introduced so far this year, Beijing hasn't yet been able to slow the economy and will likely tighten again. \n\n  The trade surplus, a key source of domestic liquidity, remained high at US$23.91 billion in September. China's broadest measure of money supply, M2, was up 18.45% at the end of September from the same time last year, accelerating from a 18.09% gain at the end of August. \n\n  Citigroup economist Shen Minggao said the central bank will likely raise interest rates once more this year and also raise the reserve ratio - though there isn't much room left to increase the ratio further, given that a high ratio hurts the country's commercial banks. \n\n  Including Saturday's hike, the PBOC has raised banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points 11 times since July 2006.

(ABB) Thursday reported an 86% jump in third-quarter net profit on soaring demand for power and automation projects, and said the global infrastructure boom will continue to boost the engineering company's earnings during the next few months. \n\n  The Zurich-based company said net profit for the July-to-September period rose to $738 million from $397 million a year earlier as the company was also able to curb costs and increase prices. \n\n  The figure beat analysts' expectations for a bottom line result of $650 million as ABB benefited from a lower tax rate and lower financial costs as it continued to cut its debt. \n\n  \"Demand for power and automation projects as well as growing concern about global warming is fueling demand for our products,\" Chief Executive Fred Kindle said during a conference call. \n\n  \"If markets stay as they are, we expect to improve our performance further,\" he added. ABB in September set out new operational targets for the period 2007 to 2011, expecting sales to grow between 8% to 11% and the operating margin to move within a band of 11% to 16% during the period. \n\n  The company Thursday said orders for the quarter jumped 33% to $8.32 billion from $6.28 billion a year-earlier, while sales improved 26% to $7.19 billion from $5.68 billion, beating ABB's own targets as well as market expectations. The operating margin, meanwhile, jumped to 14.4% from 11.8% a year-ago. \n\n  The strong figures and the promising outlook helped ABB to outperform the overall Swiss market. At 0909 GMT, shares were up 1.8 Swiss francs, or 3.4%, at CHF33.28. ABB's shares have gained almost 50% so far this year. \n\n  ABB said high demand for new infrastructure projects in China, India and the Middle East, where governments and companies need to install fresh power-distribution equipment or industrial processing sites, has continued to thrive. \n\n  ABB also benefited from strong demand in Europe, where the market is interested in investing in new, energy-efficient technologies that help companies save energy and costs. \n\n  In September, for example, ABB received an order worth $400 million to provide equipment that will connect the world's largest wind park in the North Sea with the German electricity grid. \n\n  \"These are again excellent figures. And the outlook is also promising as ABB has extended the time horizon in regard to the infrastructure boom,\" said Panagiotis Spiliopoulos, analyst at Bank Vontobel, who rates the stock a buy. \n\n  ABB had said it expected its markets to develop strongly throughout 2007, and now believes this trend will stay in place over the next nine months, with the strongest growth expected in Asia, followed by Europe and the U.S. \n\n  \"We have the capacity to meet this demand,\" Kindle said, adding that ABB still had ample capacity in emerging markets such as Poland or the Czech Republic, easing market concerns that the high demand could lead to production bottlenecks. \n\n  \"Besides the strong operational performance, ABB also produced a very strong cash flow\", said Mark Diethelm, analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank, who rates the stock at buy. \n\n  ABB, whose cash flow development has been weak in the past few years, said third-quarter cash flow rose 69.4% to $886 million, helping ABB's net cash position to jump around $1 billion to $3.3 billion. \n\n  The net cash position is expected to rise even more in the fourth quarter when ABB will receive around $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of its oil and gas unit Lummus, giving it ample ammunition for a potential acquisition. \n\n  \"We still want to grow organically and via acquisitions,\" CEO Kindle said, adding that if ABB doesn't find a suitable acquisition target it could consider a share buyback. \n\n   \n  Company Web Site: http://www.abb.com \n \n   -By Goran Mijuk, Dow Jones Newswires; +41 43 443 80 47; goran.mijuk@dowjones.com \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 25, 2007 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248905Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248910Z", "inner_id": 289, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5658, "annotations": [{"id": 4528, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "FlIKXxDKfA", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342509Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342514Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 115.044, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "f41e8a7a-81f7-40cb-8234-9bb209940c7e", "import_id": 399, "last_action": null, "task": 5658, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(10/27) The Week Ahead / Our Take On Coming Events\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n\n  Economy: \n\n  How Fed Officials Might Perceive Interest-Rate Options \n\n  ---- \n\n  By Greg Ip \n\n \n\n  When the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday, it faces another tough choice on interest rates. Standing pat retains some appeal, given the aggressive rate cut just last month. But markets put high odds on a quarter-percentage-point rate reduction, given a string of downbeat economic and profit reports, and see a small possibility of half a point. \n\n  How will Fed officials assess these options? \n\n \n\n  The do-nothing case: \n\n  On Sept. 18, the Fed cut its target for its key short-term rate by a larger-than-expected half a point to 4.75% in a bid to \"forestall some of the adverse effects\" of a credit crunch. Many officials at the time felt that was enough -- perhaps more than enough -- to cushion the economy. Credit conditions have improved slowly. The third quarter was stronger than expected. The rest of the world remains a source of strength, especially with the lower dollar. Housing has been bad, but that was expected (though it has been worse even than lowered expectations). More important, there is still no obvious spillover from housing to the economy. On the other side, some officials have lingering concerns about inflation, especially given the cheaper dollar and higher oil prices. \n\n  Holding rates steady risks a bad reaction in still-edgy markets. The Fed would have to weigh that against what rate setting it feels the forecast calls for. If it remains on hold, the Fed likely will say risks are tilted toward weaker growth rather than higher inflation, keeping hope of a rate cut alive. \n\n \n\n  The quarter-point case: \n\n  Outside of housing, the economic forecast hasn't worsened since Sept. 18. Nonetheless, jobless claims are rising, suggesting a softening employment market. Some economically sensitive companies, such as Caterpillar Inc., have issued recession warnings. Rising unemployment and slower growth blunt the inflation threat. \n\n  This alone might not warrant a rate cut; that would rest on the case that risks are skewed downward, mostly from still-declining housing activity and prices. To contain those risks, the Fed might take out an \"insurance\" rate cut, a doctrine it calls \"risk management.\" \n\n  But some officials are wary of the argument for insurance. A rate cut -- particularly if combined with a statement that hints at more --  could prompt markets to expect a string of rate cuts that the Fed doesn't envision. And some officials might dissent. \n\n \n\n  The half-point-cut case: \n\n  If the Fed thought still-tight credit conditions risked fueling a more dramatic fall in home prices, with spillover in the financial markets and consumer spending, it might consider an aggressive rate cut like last month. \n\n  But Fed officials don't have the sense of accumulating negative risks that they did in September. And, importantly, the fed-funds rate is half a point lower, as are most other rates, including rates on jumbo mortgages. Moreover, a larger-than-expected rate cut could raise questions about the Fed's anti-inflation credibility. And some outsiders worry it could fuel a run on the dollar. \n\n \n\n  Telecommunications: \n\n  Alcatel-Lucent Results May Be a Telltale of Fixit Strategy \n\n  ---- \n\n  By Gabriel Kahn \n\n \n\n  When Alcatel-Lucent releases third-quarter earnings results Wednesday, investors will be looking to see what strategy Chief Executive Patricia Russo has devised to lead the telecom-equipment firm out of its tailspin. \n\n  Since news leaked in mid-September that the board had asked Ms. Russo to present a plan to fix the firm's problems, expectations have been building among investors and analysts. The company has issued three profit warnings since Paris-based Alcatel SA and New Jersey-based Lucent Technologies completed their $13 billion merger in December 2006. The group's share price has fallen some 40%, and some analysts have called for Ms. Russo to resign. \n\n  But unfortunately for Ms. Russo, there doesn't appear to be any quick fix for Alcatel-Lucent's troubles. \n\n  The telecom-equipment business is brutally competitive. Just as new low-cost competitors from China emerge, the huge telecom operators that buy equipment have consolidated, meaning there are fewer buyers. All this has led to intense pressure on prices, hurting profits not only at Alcatel-Lucent, but also at rivals Nokia-Seimens Networks and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson. \n\n  One thing Ms. Russo can do is accelerate the cost-cutting undertaken as Alcatel-Lucent integrates. The company has forecast pretax cost savings of <euro>1.7 billion over three years. About half of the savings announced to date come from cutting 12,500 jobs, and the rest by reducing procurement costs, selling real estate such as offices, and eliminating overlapping products. Ms. Russo is widely expected to increase the cost-cutting in a bid to shore up Alcatel-Lucent's bottom line. \n\n  A tougher problem that has few easy fixes is Alcatel-Lucent's wireless division. Revenue and margins have been suffering in wireless for the past year, and some analysts see it as the heart of Alcatel-Lucent's troubles. \n\n  Before the merger, Alcatel's wireless products, in the GSM standard widely used in Europe, were seen as second-best to Ericsson's offerings. Lucent was strong in CDMA wireless, which rules in the U.S. With the merger, the firm aimed to strengthen its wireless portfolio. It also bought a line of products from Nortel Networks, known as UMTS technology. But stitching all three of these technologies into an attractive wireless portfolio is proving difficult. In addition, it hasn't phased out all of its overlapping products. That means it has to support and research several different technologies at once. One analyst estimates Alcatel-Lucent has five different radio-access technologies alone, and it must retain engineers to support and service all the different products. That has created an expensive mess that is hurting profitability and opening the door to competitors like Ericsson to try to poach customers. \n\n  But if Ms. Russo doesn't convince investors that she has a clear roadmap for how the company can emerge, she may face louder calls for her resignation. The board released a statement of support for Ms. Russo earlier in the month, and the structure of the board makes her hard to oust. A two-thirds vote of the 14 directors is required to remove her. And given the deep-seated nature of the firm's problems, it isn't clear whether a new CEO would fare much better. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 26, 2007 19:40 ET (23:40 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248941Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.248946Z", "inner_id": 290, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5659, "annotations": [{"id": 4529, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "mb7VkgRuSu", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342537Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342542Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 18.352, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "efa413c0-efef-41a6-b524-e3401dd26e90", "import_id": 400, "last_action": null, "task": 5659, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DOW JONES GLOBAL INDEXES - LEADERS\n\n                 Leading Industry Groups \n           and Strongest Stocks in Each Group \n \n(Index values based on U.S. dollars;

For Econ Growth\n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The euro hasn't appreciated sharply against a trade-weighted basket of other currencies, and at current levels isn't a major drag on economic growth, the head of the International Monetary Fund's European department said Monday. \n\n  And in a report on the outlook for European economies, the IMF said the European Central bank's decision to leave its key refinancing rate on hold since the onset of the turmoil in global credit markets was \"appropriate.\" \n\n  However, the IMF added that should credit markets return to normal soon, the ECB and other European central banks may need to raise their key interest rates to counter inflationary pressures arising from higher oil prices. \n\n  Although the euro lost ground against the dollar Monday, it has gained over 10% against the greenback over the last 12 months. \n\n  That has led to complaints from exporters about their loss of competitiveness on international markets, and renewed warnings from euro-zone policymakers of the dangers of high levels of volatility in foreign exchange markets. \n\n  Finance ministers from the euro zone will discuss the currency's strength against the dollar and the Chinese yuan when they meet later Monday in Brussels. \n\n  But, speaking at a press conference, the director of the IMF's European department said against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, the euro has appreciated much less sharply. \n\n  \"In our view, the value of the euro - taken on an effective basis - remains in a range where the economy is continuing to function well,\" Michael Deppler said. \"We don't see a big problem.\" \n\n  The IMF official noted that the euro zone's current account is expected to be \"roughly balanced\" in 2008, while \"exports are doing well.\" \n\n  In its first report on the economy of Europe as a whole, the IMF said it expects growth to slow only \"moderately\" next year. In contrast to the U.S., it expects developments in credit markets to have little effect on domestic demand, which it predicts will continue to expand at around 2.5%. \n\n  \"The exposure of households in the U.S. is significantly greater than it is in Europe,\" Deppler said. \n\n  The IMF official said with a small number of exceptions - the U.K., Spain and Ireland - housing markets in Europe are \"fairly balanced.\" He added that there is no evidence of an equivalent to problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. \n\n  \"There are no correspondingly severe problems with lending to Europeans that we can detect,\" Deppler said. \n\n  The IMF said key interest rates have \"been appropriately kept on hold\" by the ECB and other European central banks while there are risks to growth from the turmoil in credit markets. But, it added that \"a further tightening may be required\" if those risks don't materialize.\" \n\n  In particular, Deppler cited the inflationary pressures caused by rising oil prices in the context of economic growth that the IMF expects won't be much below potential at a time when the unemployment rate in many countries is low by recent historic standards. \n\n  The IMF said the response of central banks to the turmoil in credit markets \"has been broadly effective so far.\" \n\n  \"Central banks will have to continue to stand ready to provide liquidity to deal with systemic risks,\" the Fund said. \n\n \n\n  -By Paul Hannon, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 20 7842 9491, paul.hannon@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 12, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252511Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252519Z", "inner_id": 292, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5661, "annotations": [{"id": 4531, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "_voG95K-BW", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342601Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342607Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 38.157, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "911e4276-a3a3-4772-9030-6a300f304036", "import_id": 402, "last_action": null, "task": 5661, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(11/15) UPDATE: HSBC Takes A $3.4 Billion Charge\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n   By Margot Patrick \n\n  LONDON -- HSBC Holdings PLC said it took a higher-than-expected $3.4 billion impairment charge on bad debts at its HSBC Finance unit for the third quarter, but said revenue growth across the bank's global operations \"more than offset\" the charge. \n\n  Besides the impairment charge -- which came on top of $4.1 billion in charges for the first half -- HSBC Finance, the bank's U.S. consumer-lending business, boosted its reserves against bad mortgages to $3.4 billion from $2.6 billion. \n\n  Impairment charges and loss reserves at HSBC Finance are being closely watched, because it is one of the U.S.'s largest lenders to people with weak credit. \n\n  The bank yesterday gave a third-quarter trading update for its entire business, and reported earnings results at HSBC Finance for the period. \n\n  Standard & Poor's said HSBC Finance's numbers showed the first material signs of deterioration in its branch-sourced mortgages and unsecured lending.

Although the media picked up on the story few investors took it too seriously. \n\n  Most agreed that should such an event transpire, then a global recession would be a foregone conclusion, which would bring the price of oil right back down. \n\n  Well, here we nearly are. This week the price of a barrel of crude oil reached $98. \n\n  So, is it time to panic? \n\n  The message from three of the world's biggest central banks this week was no, or at least not yet. \n\n  The Bank of England left rates on hold at 5.75%, and made no comment. We will get an insight into how the Old Lady sees the world when we see her quarterly inflation report. \n\n  The European Central Bank also left rates on hold, albeit at the much lower level of 4%. \n\n  In the press conference that followed the decision, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounded more concerned about upside inflation risks than he did about downside growth risks, though he did note the \"brutal\" rise of the euro. That looks like ECB code for \"it's gone too far.\" \n\n  And finally, in his testimony to Congress, the Federal Reserve Board chairman warned about slowing growth but seemed to spend more time warning about the dangers of higher inflation. \n\n  The overall message to the markets was this: \"You're on your own, at least for now.\" \n\n  This came as a disappointment to the markets, already reeling from the credit squeeze and now looking at the highest real oil price on record. \n\n  Adjusted using the U.S. gross domestic product deflator, the oil price has now passed its 1980 peak. \n\n  But the global economy continues to power ahead - even the supposedly ailing U.S. managed close to 4% growth in the three months to September. \n\n  So, has oil lost its power to shock? \n\n  A number of optimists say yes. \n\n  We were worried at $50 per barrel and nothing happened; and we worried when it hit $80 per barrel and the global economy continued to grow rapidly. So, why should we worry about $100 per barrel? \n\n  The most popular explanation for the belief that oil has lost its power to stop the global economy in its tracks revolves around the fact that we have become far more efficient users of oil. \n\n  The question of why the economy may be less vulnerable to oil price shocks today has been examined by a number of recent academic studies. \n\n  James Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, provides the following summary on his blog. \n\n  Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gali have identified four factors as all making a contribution: (a) good luck (i.e., lack of concurrent adverse shocks), (b) smaller share of oil in production, (c) more flexible labor markets and (d) improvements in monetary policy. \n\n  A study last year from the Congressional Budget Office emphasized a similar list of favorable developments. \n\n  Jerry Taylor and Peter VanDoren review some of the other evidence, and conclude: \"All the new analyses agree that the more flexible economy that we have now, allows us to cope more easily with oil price shocks.... It is time for America to get over its inordinate fear of oil shocks. Soaring prices aren't pretty, but they are scarcely the existential threat to our economy posited by many.\" \n\n  As a share of GDP, oil consumption has certainly fallen across the developed world. That means, according to some estimates, that crude oil will need to reach $150 per barrel before it has the same potential to hurt as $90 (in today's money) did back in 1980. \n\n  There is a good deal of logic to this argument. Better oil efficiency must make a difference. \n\n  But even so, we hardly want to wait around to find out how painful $140 per barrel might be. \n\n  One of the key reasons that the oil shocks of the 1970s had such a devastating effect on global growth was that they were both, in the economics jargon, supply shocks. \n\n  When any price rises unexpectedly it can be seen as either a demand shock - excess demand pushing up prices - or as a supply shock - insufficient supply, which also pushes up prices. \n\n  The trick of course is to work out which it is. Demand shocks are relatively easy for central banks to deal with; they can simply raise interest rates to curb demand. \n\n  But supply shocks are a completely different matter. In the face of an adverse supply shock a central bank will be torn between the negative impact on demand and the positive impact on inflation. \n\n  Indeed, that largely sums up the message from the Fed and the ECB this week. They each recognized both sides of the dilemma. And the problem is if they go for the wrong lever or even simply too early, it could all get very unpleasant. \n\n  The U.K. authorities probably got the first oil shock in 1974 about as wrong as it was possible to. They managed to preside over near 30% inflation and mass unemployment. \n\n  Lessons have obviously been learned. \n\n  But it doesn't help when the data we are all relying on change the underlying picture. \n\n  We use the data from the International Energy Agency, a branch of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to analyze the underlying causes of any change in the price of oil. \n\n  Until recently we had concluded that an increase in demand, largely from China and India, was the overwhelming force driving up oil prices. \n\n  Negative supply shocks had contributed to the rise, most notably after Hurricane Katrina, but they accounted for less than a fifth of the rise since 2002, by our calculation. \n\n  But then the data on real oil consumption were revised, on the back of U.S. GDP revisions and higher Chinese demand. \n\n  There was also a significant downward revision to oil supply. Rather than being a positive force as the IEA had originally expected it to be, oil production slowed during 2007. \n\n  OPEC quotas played a role, but the bigger miscalculation was the failure to materialize of an expected surge in sub-Saharan African supply. \n\n  There were also revisions to the previous year's data, leaving the overall picture significantly changed. \n\n  Adverse supply shocks appear to now account for around half of the rise in crude oil prices since 2005. \n\n  If true, that will only complicate the issue for central banks around the world. \n\n  The danger is that the rise in real prices might combine with the ongoing credit squeeze to produce a toxic cocktail. \n\n  The hope is that central banks have learned the lessons of the 1970s. \n\n  As long as inflation expectations stay well anchored, there is a very good chance that this time will be different. \n\n \n\n  -By Danny Gabay, 44-207-796-9561; danny.gabay@fathom-consulting.com \n\n  (Danny Gabay is a director of Fathom Financial Consulting Ltd. and a member of London Diversified Fund Management LLP.) \n\n  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \n\n  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

Current: Big Ben&apos;s Dumb Idea For Fannie And Freddie\n\n   (From BARRON'S) \n   By Jim McTague \n\n  Being the Federal Reserve bank chairman may make you feel like a know-it-all, but it doesn't actually make you one. \n\n  Ben Bernanke demonstrated the truth of this axiom on Capitol Hill recently when he suggested that secondary mortgage-market giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac temporarily be granted the authority to buy jumbo home-mortgages of up to $1 million -- more than double the companies' current limit on loan sizes. Though Bernanke said this would help the beleaguered housing sector, James Lockhart, the man who regulates Fannie and Freddie, was totally surprised by the suggestion and told us it would do more harm than good. \n\n  \"We're talking to the Fed about this,\" says Lockhart, who is director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, an agency that is supposed to prevent Freddie and Fannie from doing anything unsafe and unsound. \"Given the moment,\" Lockhart points out wisely, \"Fannie and Freddie have enough to do in their own space -- the conforming-loan area. They don't have any particular expertise with jumbos. They don't buy them, they don't have systems, models or risk-management tools for them. It would take a lot of implementation.\" \n\n  The two congressionally chartered companies buy mortgages from banks and mortgage companies, which, in turn, use the proceeds to make even more loans, providing liquidity to the marketplace. The size limit on loans eligible for sale to Fannie and Freddie, currently $417,000, is revised annually to reflect changes in an index of housing prices. \n\n  Right now, thousands of struggling homeowners in expensive markets like California and parts of Florida are burdened with adjustable-rate jumbo loans -- mortgages larger than the Fannie-Freddie limit -- with introductory \"teaser\" rates that will reset to much higher levels this year and next. Those homeowners would like to convert to more manageable fixed-rate loans. But Wall Street, pension funds and other buyers of jumbos have all but stopped their purchases, lest they get caught holding the bag if conditions worsen. \n\n  For this reason, Bernanke also suggested that the U.S. Treasury explicitly guarantee the repayment of such jumbos if purchased by Freddie and Fannie. (Markets already treat the two mortgage titans as if their actions carry \"implicit\" guarantees, despite annual denials from Treasury.) \n\n  We asked the White House and Treasury what they thought of Ben's brainstorm and, not surprisingly, were put off with \"No comment.\" \n\n  Lockhart wasn't so bashful. This reliable Bush school- chum was placed at the helm of OFHEO in 2006 to make sure that Fannie and Freddie fulfilled the terms of consent agreements signed earlier when they were caught cooking their books to make earnings appear more robust than in reality. The firms promised to strengthen accounting and management systems, to begin reporting their financial results to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to limit growth and maintain capital levels 30% higher than required by law -- until they got their houses in order. \n\n  Those restrictions, says Lockhart, prevented the current mortgage crisis from being even larger, by keeping Fannie and Freddie in good shape to buy loans. But he might have to lift the capital and portfolio-growth restrictions sometime after February 2008, if the two giants meet the terms of their earlier agreements and are operating safely. He certainly wouldn't want to do that now: \"It would be a major mistake to lower capital requirements in this market -- almost like repeating the mistakes of the S&L days.\" \n\n  Lockhart has limited powers as a regulator -- he is a lion tamer with neither chair nor lash. His agency was able to impose consent agreements on the two corporations three years ago because they were weakened politically at the time. Fannie and Freddie have since regained influence on the Hill. Lockhart has been urging the Senate to enact legislation, already passed in the House, that would create a new regulatory agency with more teeth. Otherwise, Freddie and Fannie, which already are leveraged about 50 to 1, would be allowed to leverage themselves even higher. Banks have far more rigorous capital standards. \n\n  Fannie Mae is closer to complying with the consent agreements than is Freddie Mac, because the latter has proved slower at rebuilding itself. When Richard Syron replaced Leland Brendsel as CEO at Freddie Mac, he brought a new management team with him -- one that didn't know the company. \"There was a learning period,\" says Lockhart, \"and Syron made some unfortunate choices. He lost a CFO and a COO, which has made it tough; and he still has a thin management team.\" \n\n  Even with the growth restriction, Freddie and Fannie have been buying more than 60% of the nation's new mortgages, up from 40% last year. That could put them at greater risk in a recession, possibly even requiring a federal bailout. That, says Lockhart, is the ultimate reason why a more powerful regulatory office is needed. \"Congress,\" he says, \"really does have to act.\" We couldn't agree more. \n\n  --- \n\n  For Barron's subscription information call 1-888-BARRONS ext. 685 or inquire online at http://www.barronsmag.com/subscription/subscription.html. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 17, 2007 00:04 ET (05:04 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252670Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252676Z", "inner_id": 296, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5665, "annotations": [{"id": 4535, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "GF3LR4KC9c", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342712Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342717Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 70.0, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "00d18f13-4efc-4b15-97f3-3a42f04759f1", "import_id": 406, "last_action": null, "task": 5665, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "German Buba Projects Sticky Inflation, Slowing Econ Growth\n\n \n\n  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German economic growth is likely to significantly slow next year, while inflation should remain sticky due to rising energy and food prices, the German central bank's December bulletin showed Monday. \n\n  Gross domestic product will expand 1.6% in 2008, in real and calendar-adjusted terms, and grow 2.0% in 2009, the Bundesbank said.

But it also plans to take a \"razor gang\" approach to public spending, cutting back on some programs introduced by the previous government. \n\n  \"If it succeeds in trimming waste and improves value in doing so, that will come with the considerable additional benefit of taking pressure off interest rates,\" Richardson said. \n\n  Access Economics also cautioned that with growth in both demand and profits tipped to slow, the government will need to cut back on spending in coming years to make sure it meets its target of keeping the budget in surplus on average over the economic cycle. \n\n  \"Unless policies change, the surplus will drop back to 0.6% of gross domestic product by 2010-11, and it is seen heading further south thereafter,\" Richardson said. \n\n  Access Economics is forecasting a surplus of A$15 billion in 2008-09, A$13.6 billion in 2009-10, and A$8.2 billion in 2010-11. \n\n  That compares with Treasury's midyear forecast for budget surpluses of A$14.4 billion in 2008-09, A$17.7 billion in 2009-10, and A$15.1 billion in 2010-11. \n\n \n\n  -By Rachel Pannett, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-6208-0901; rachel.pannett@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 16, 2007 08:01 ET (13:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252761Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252766Z", "inner_id": 299, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5668, "annotations": [{"id": 4538, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "Z0iA3chWX6", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342795Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342800Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 233.079, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "0a255428-9d14-4fc7-aed7-20b1178dacbb", "import_id": 409, "last_action": null, "task": 5668, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UPDATE: PBOC Imposes Special Deposit Requirement - Sources\n\n \n   (Adds analysts' comments, background on special deposits) \n \n\n  SHANGHAI (Dow Jones)--China's central bank has told  selected city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives they must place special deposits with it on Dec. 27, the second time this year it has adopted this unconventional approach to drain liquidity, two people familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday. \n\n  The decision indicates Beijing's mounting concerns over the excess liquidity in its financial system caused by a ballooning trade surplus. It also came after the remarks by People's Bank of China Vice Gov. Wu Xiaoling over the weekend that China needs to further curb money-supply and credit growth because \"monetary factors\" do add to inflation pressures. \n\n  Despite the PBOC's instruction, the banks and cooperatives participating in the program can decide how much they are each willing to place as special deposits, said the two people, who declined to be named. \n\n  The central bank will offer an interest rate of 3.37% on three-month deposits and 3.99% on one-year deposits, they added. The two rates are the same as the yields on the three-month and one-year bills the PBOC sold in its regular open market operation last week. \n\n  An official at the PBOC's news department declined to comment. \n\n  The PBOC last told an unspecified group of city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives to submit special deposits Oct. 17, the first time since 2000 it used this method to withdraw liquidity. \n\n  \"The special deposit has gradually become a routine tightening tool by the central bank to strengthen its credit control in smaller financial institutions. It also reflects the pressure the central bank's facing to curb rising inflation,\" said Shanghai Securities analyst Wang Yingfeng. \n\n  Despite the central bank's five interest rate hikes and nine reserve requirement ratio increases in the first 11 months of this year, China's consumer price index accelerated to an 11-year high of 6.9% in November. The PBOC said Dec. 8 it will increase banks' reserve requirement ratio for the 10th time this year by 100 basis points, twice as much as previous increases this year. \n\n  Compared with the upcoming 100 basis-point ratio hike, which is expected to take about CNY350 billion out of circulation, the total amount drained by the special deposits is unlikely to be huge, given the small asset base of city commercial banks and credit cooperatives, analysts said. \n\n  A Shanghai-based fund manager said he expects the special deposits to lock up around CNY10 billion in funds. \n\n  \"But if the PBOC fails to slow down the growth in money supply and inflation in the coming months, it could order the smaller lenders to deposit more funds next time,\" said the fund manager, who declined to be named. \n\n \n\n  -Wang Ming contributed to this story; Dow Jones Newswires; (86-21) 6120-1200; ming.wang@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 17, 2007 21:31 ET (02:31 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252792Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252797Z", "inner_id": 300, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5669, "annotations": [{"id": 4539, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "yNvMG4jBkl", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342822Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342827Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 368.238, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "42067cc4-d408-433b-a938-2737214896c5", "import_id": 410, "last_action": null, "task": 5669, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "ASIAN MORNING BRIEFING: US Stks Plunge After Fed Cuts 25 Bps\n\n \nDJIA         13432.77 -294.26  -2.14% \nNasdaq        2652.35  -66.60  -2.45% \nS&P 500       1477.65  -38.31  -2.53% \nFTSE 100      6536.90  -28.50  -0.43% \nXetra DAX     8009.42  -23.94  -0.30% \n \n2Y Tsy  100 12/32   +14/32 2.92% -23.5 \n5Y Tsy  100  9/32 +1  1/32 3.31% -23.0 \n10Y Tsy 102  8/32 +1 14/32 3.97% -17.8 \n \nUSD/JPY     110.55-57    -1.02% \nRange       112.13-110.50 \nEUR/USD     1.4655-59    -0.39% \nRange       1.4750-1.4653 \nAUD/USD     0.8717-22    -1.58% \nRange       0.8895-0.8714 \n \nUSD/JPY 1M Vol    9.95/10.25% \nEUR/USD 1M Vol    8.40/ 8.65% \nAUD/USD 1M Vol   11.90/12.50% \n \nComex Gold          $817.10  +$3.60 \nComex Gold Range    $809.00-$819.30 \nNymex Crude (NY)     $90.02  +$2.16 \n \nU.S. SUMMARY & ASIAN OUTLOOK: \n\n  STOCKS: \n\n  U.S. stocks fell sharply after the Federal Reserve reacted less drastically to the \"credit crunch\" than many traders had hoped, cutting the federal funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5% and the discount rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%. \n\n  After several hints of cuts from Fed members and the government's trumpeted concerns about conditions in mortgage markets, some traders had anticipated a more decisive move from the central bank. When that didn't come, optimism on financials was flushed out of the market, and momentum changed, said Pete McCorry, senior equity trader at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \n\n  \"It pushes off a sense of recovery\" from financial woes, McCorry said. \n\n  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 294.26, or 2.1%, to 13432.77, its biggest drop in nearly five weeks. The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 66.60, or 2.4%, to 2652.35. \n\n  Among individual stocks, General Electric lost 1% to 37.03. The industrial and financial conglomerate projected 2008 per-share earnings below analysts' expectations, reflecting \"a slowing U.S. economy.\" \n\n  Washington Mutual dropped 12% to 17.42. The largest U.S. savings and loan plans to slash its dividend by 73%, raise $2.5 billion in fresh capital and cut more than 3,000 jobs to address \"unprecedented challenges in the mortgage and credit markets.\" \n\n  While WaMu had its own issues, banks were decimated in the aftermath of the Fed's action, as declines were marked by all 80 members of the S&P 500's financial sector. \n\n  Dow industrial AT&T rose 4.1% to 39.46. The telecommunications giant announced a 12.7% increase in its quarterly dividend, the biggest boost on an annual basis in its history; a new 400 million-share repurchase plan; and financial forecasts for the next few years that topped expectations. \n\n  Crude oil futures rose above $90 a barrel in New York as ice storms stopped flow through key U.S. oil pipelines and after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. \n\n  The base metals ended the London Metal Exchange trading session in recent ranges ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Gold futures moved mildly higher in New York as trading was subdued ahead of the announcement. \n\n  FOREX: \n\n  The yen bested the euro and dollar in New York after financial markets befell a spell of risk aversion when the Federal Open Market Committee announced a third consecutive cut to interest rates to defend the U.S. economy against recession. \n\n  The yen surged on a sharp decline in U.S. stocks, which were disappointed by the mere 25-basis point cut to the fed funds rate, instead of a 50-basis point reduction - although few market watchers actually expected the latter. \n\n  \"This is the bare minimum that was expected,\" said Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. \n\n  Consequently, the euro dropped almost three yen from its intraday high and the dollar declined almost one-and-a-half yen from its intraday high after the announcement. The euro's significant fall, just one day after striking a one-month high of Y164.58, helped boost the dollar against the single currency. \n\n  The dollar was also boosted against the euro, said Robert Sinche, head of global foreign exchange at Bank of America in New York, because it is more attractive than it would have been if there was a 50-basis point cut. \n\n  A cut to the fed funds rate of any size suggests downside risks for the U.S. currency because lower rates reduce investors' returns on dollar-denominated assets. \n\n  However, the dollar's reaction wasn't as large as seen in the past, perhaps because the Fed itself stressed the current uncertainty. \"For now, the foreign exchange markets will be taking their cue from other markets, like the commodity and equity markets,\" Sinche added. \n\n  Tuesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.4651 from $1.4713 late Monday, while the dollar was at Y110.67 from Y111.64. The euro was at Y162.14 from Y164.25, according to EBS. The U.K. pound was at $2.0334 from $2.0470, while the dollar was quoted at CHF1.1312 from CHF1.1283 late Monday. \n\n  The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to reduce the federal funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5%, its third-straight reduction since September totaling 100 basis points. It also cut the discount rate it charges banks that borrow directly from the Fed by 25 basis points to 4.75%. \n\n  The market anticipated a cut after statements from several officials early last month, most pointedly by Fed Governor Randall Kroszner, who said on Nov. 16 that \"the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year.\" \n\n  The dollar had retreated from its lifetime lows against the euro following that speech on the positive momentum it created in U.S. equities. \n\n  \"Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing,\" the FOMC said in its statement, reflecting the \"intensification\" of the housing slump and slower business and consumer spending. \n\n  The statement signaled an about-face from the previous Fed meeting, when the board suggested further easing was off the table. The Fed also dropped its previous assertion that growth and inflation risks were roughly balanced, opting instead for an open-ended view, and pledged to \"act as needed\" to keep the economy growing and inflation in check. \n\n  The buck and euro's subsequent decline versus the yen followed a typical low-risk appetite trading pattern. The yen benefits during times of risk aversion because Japan's ultra-low interest rates make the yen a funding currency for riskier assets when the market has a more positive sentiment. When that perspective shifts, the funds shift back into the yen. A similar pattern often aids the dollar against the euro and currencies like the Brazilian real, as it did Tuesday. \n\n  However, currency analysts say that the Fed's downside view of the economy indicates that this is no dollar rebound. \n\n  BONDS: \n\n  U.S. Treasury prices soared after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its target rate by 25 basis points, as investors interpreted the move as insufficient to help considerably ease conditions in strained credit markets. \n\n  While investors had widely expected the quarter point cut to the fed funds rate, many had anticipated a heftier ease in the discount window rate to loosen up strained money markets, where interbank lending rates have remained stubbornly high. When that didn't materialize, investors grew more convinced that financial market conditions will worsen, a reaction that sent Treasury yields lower as stocks fell. Bond prices move inversely to yields. \n\n  With shorter-term Treasurys gaining the most, the yield curve also steepened. In late trade, the two-year note was up 14/32 at 2.92% and the 10-year note was up 1 14/32 at 3.97%, leaving Treasurys benchmark yield curve, the spread between the two- and 10-year note yields, at plus 105 basis points.   Just before the announcement, the two-year Treasury note was yielding 3.13% and the 10-year note was yielding 4.10%. \n\n  Treasury bills were also boosted by the news as investors sought out the safest possible assets, with the three-month T-bill bond equivalent yield down 14 basis points at 2.91% and the six month T-bill bond equivalent yield down 13 basis points at 3.18%. \n\n  \"The expectation in the market was that they needed to move the discount rate below the funds rate,\" said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasurys at Jefferies & Co. in New York. \n\n  The fact that policymakers chose not to make a more dramatic move was surely \"a big disappointment for the credit markets,\" said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn., with the move \"undoubtedly bullish for Treasurys relative to just about everything else.\" Ader said he has his eye on the 2.80% level for the two-year note as a possibly attractive selling spot. \n\n  In its meeting statement, the Fed also dropped the assertion from its previous statement that the risks to growth and to inflation were roughly equal. The Fed pledged to \"act as needed\" to keep the economy growing and control inflation. \n\n  The day's decision further boosted shorter-term Treasurys, the most sensitive to the Fed's decisions, which have been gaining recently on renewed signs that banks are wary to lend to each other given concerns about their exposure to shaky subprime and structured finance investments. Cash-hoarding ahead of year-end has also kept money market rates high. \n\n  With the Fed and markets not seeing eye to eye on the outlook for money markets and the impact of the credit crunch on the economy, interest rate futures remain priced for further rate cuts in 2008, with Treasurys likely to remain in favor. \n\n  \"The Fed and the market are just not on the same page,\" said Richard Gilhooly, senior fixed income strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 11, 2007 17:13 ET (22:13 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252832Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252838Z", "inner_id": 301, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5670, "annotations": [{"id": 4540, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "q14niLSSuq", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342849Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342854Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 56.006, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "b7713958-4140-4207-b0ec-c4e7f8da2be1", "import_id": 411, "last_action": null, "task": 5670, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Jersey Electricity 13-Week Revenue In Energy Business Up 28%\n\n \n\n  Edited Press Release \n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Jersey Electricity Company Limited said Thursday that in the thirteen weeks from the beginning of the financial year to the end of December, unit sales of electricity in its Energy business rose by 8% due mainly to unseasonably mild weather in the same period last year. \n\n  Revenues in the Energy business are 28% higher than the same period last year due to this increase in sales volumes combined with a tariff rise which took place on 1 January 2007 to cover an increase in its cost base from escalating wholesale electricity prices. \n\n  The company said: \"A similar trending of unit sales and revenues continued during the month of January 2008.

They're now down by 6%. MBIA Inc. (MBI), which saw its shares gain 33% Wednesday, has fallen by 8%. SCA has plummeted 17%. \n\n  Dinallo may have tempered hopes of an imminent deal, as he said that there are \"complicated issues\" with many parties involved. \"Any effective plan will take some time to finalize,\" he said. \"In the meantime, we will not respond to the inevitable rumors.\" \n\n  The New York Times reported that Dinallo told a group of Wall Street executives Wednesday that it should move in 48 hours to set up a deal on the bond insurers. \n\n  But a banker involved in the discussions called them \"very preliminary,\" according to The Wall Street Journal. \n\n  Complex securities guaranteed by the bond insurers, such as subprime mortgage-backed deals, have plummeted in value amid the credit market turmoil. The insurers guarantee about $2.4 trillion in outstanding debt, and the loss of their top-notch ratings means a repricing of insured debt and a chilling effect on the industry. \n\n  Also, it could trigger further downgrades at banks and brokers, who already are reeling from subprime losses and are searching for additional capital themselves. Wall Street firms had bought protection from the insurers as a way to reduce their capital needs, but is now facing the possibility of having to put the losses on their own balance sheets. \n\n  An MBIA spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday on the bailout discussions, and Ambac didn't return a call for comment. The insurers weren't present at the meeting between Dinallo and bank executives, the Wall Street Journal reported. \n\n  Credit default swaps, which are contracts allowing investors to wager on firms' creditworthiness, tightened significantly Wednesday for MBIA and Ambac on bailout hopes but widened somewhat Thursday morning. They were unchanged after the Fitch and Dinallo releases, at 455 basis points for MBIA and 460 basis points for Ambac. That means the annual cost of protecting a notional $10 million of MBIA bonds against default for five years is $455,000 and for Ambac bonds, $460,000. \n\n \n\n  -By Romy Varghese, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4287; romy.varghese@dowjones.com \n\n  (Kate Haywood contributed to this report.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 24, 2008 12:12 ET (17:12 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252921Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252926Z", "inner_id": 304, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5673, "annotations": [{"id": 4543, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "kpdGD4Ykgo", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342933Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342937Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 183.264, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "c52c5afd-ab31-4b72-a81c-cfa855f81e6b", "import_id": 414, "last_action": null, "task": 5673, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "News Highlights: Top Equities Stories Of The Day\n\n \nCHINA GOVT:CHINA EASTERN DEAL SHOULD FOLLOW MARKET PRINCIPLES \n\n   China's state asset regulator said Friday that foreign investment in state companies should be based on market principles, following a report it had pressured China Eastern Airlines Corp.'s shareholders to approve a tie-up with Singapore Airlines Ltd.

Forecasts had come in a relatively narrow range of 7.2% and 7.5%. \n\n  \"I can't say new things - it's evidently food and energy prices again, cooking oil, milk, dairy products and eggs...the rise in the other categories was negligible,\" a KSH statistician told Dow Jones Newswires at the time of the release. \n\n  Food prices rose 0.8% and car fuel prices increased 2.0% on the month, slowing somewhat from monthly rises of 1.4% and 3.3% respectively in November. The slower increase was expected by analysts. The price of cooking oil jumped 9.2% on the month while cheese rose 2.8% and eggs rose 1.7% in the same period. \n\n  Although food and energy prices boosted headline inflation, services prices, which are also closely watched by analysts, rose only 0.1%. Consumer durables prices fell 0.1% and clothing prices were unchanged on the month in December. \n\n  Core inflation, excluding volatile energy and food prices, also picked up in December. \n\n  \"Unprocessed food prices such as (the price of) eggs are excluded from the core reading but processed food prices are not,\" Minary added. She cited milk as a booster for core prices as well as for the headline reading, as milk prices rose 2.4% on the month. \n\n  Minary declined to be specific on the outlook for inflation. She noted, however, that price hikes reported in the local press by local governments of certain services prices such as public transport, utilities, and other centrally mandated price rises as postal services will boost January inflation, as most probably will a full liberalization of the power market. \n\n  Inflation was 8.0% on average in 2007, up sharply from 3.9% in 2006, but in line with analysts' forecasts in a poll carried out by Dow Jones Newswires. \n\n \n   Statistics office Web site: www.ksh.hu \n \n\n  -By Margit Feher, Dow Jones Newswires; +36-20-925-2364; margit.feher@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 15, 2008 04:17 ET (09:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252984Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.252990Z", "inner_id": 306, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5675, "annotations": [{"id": 4545, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "GUkAV-_-PS", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342987Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.342992Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 86.957, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "82028619-045f-4098-82e4-a7b0b0f9d0ce", "import_id": 416, "last_action": null, "task": 5675, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Irvine Energy: 1st Hydrocarbon Sales, Niobrara To Commence\n\n \n\n  Edited Press Release \n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Irvine Energy, a AIM-listed oil and gas exploration and production company, said Tuesday that production has commenced within its 162,000 acre portfolio of onshore oil and gas projects in the USA. \n\n \n\n  Highlights \n\n  * Irvine Net Production from Jan 9 to Jan 31 was 6.973 million standard cubic feet of gas and 76 BBLS of oil, from 18 wells in Oklahoma, marking Irvine's first hydrocarbon sales.

The well will be targeting primarily oil pay in the Arbuckle formation as an extension of the highly productive Cooley oil field. \n\n  The Ares and Udall project areas 3D seismic programmes are in progress and the Ares 3D is underway and expected to finish by March. The seismic crew will move directly to the Udall area and begin shooting there upon completion of the Ares. \n\n  Once completed, processing is expected to take 30 days and interpretation will take an additional 30 days. This is being conducted to identify multiple drill targets in accordance with the Company's development plan. \n\n  Following an evaluation programme of the Niobrara Project in Kansas during the second half of 2007, 20 initial wells were selected for development. All of these now have pumping units and gas gathering lines in place. \n\n  The water disposal permit has been approved and the water disposal well is being prepared for use. The gas sales contracts are in place and a gas compressor is being prepared. \n\n  Production is targeted at 500 mcf/ d net to Irvine, with current prices in the region of $7.00/mcf. First gas sales are expected in March. \n\n  Development of the extensive inventory of undrilled well locations in this project is expected to begin in Q2, after production from the initial 20 wells has stabilised and production rates are confirmed to be in line with Irvine's expectations. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 19, 2008 03:17 ET (08:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253017Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253022Z", "inner_id": 307, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5676, "annotations": [{"id": 4546, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "nhwzoXMcNJ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.358255Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.358288Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 123.272, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "4c3da119-e194-436a-a8bf-fe052f65e8ea", "import_id": 417, "last_action": null, "task": 5676, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "FOCUS: German Unions Prepping Strikes As Talks Drag On\n\n   By Roman Kessler   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Ignoring pleas for wage restraint, Germany's two largest unions are lining up more warning strikes to back some of the biggest wage demands in the euro zone. \n\n  Nearly 2,000 Eastern German steel workers from the big IG Metall union Tuesday staged warning strikes for an 8% pay raise at two steel plants, including the Arcelor Mittal GmbH plant at Eisenhuettenstadt, a unit of the ArcelorMittal group (MT). \n\n  IG Metall, with 2.3 million members, seeks an 8% pay rise for more than 100,000 steel workers and says it's ready to do more for its other members in the months ahead, including auto workers and electrical workers. \n\n  The Ver.di services union, also demanding an 8% pay hike, Tuesday resumed talks with government representatives threatening to stage warning strikes later in the week. Federal and local governments are standing by their offer of 5% in three steps over two years. \n\n  The warning strikes are precursors to possible open-ended labor actions if truce periods end without a deal. The IG Metal negotiations are set to end on Feb. 19. The public-sector talks are set to run until March 7, but the unions can break off talks any time and call an open-ended walkout. \n\n  German auto makers Daimler AG (DAI.XE), Porsche AG (POR3.XE) and Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE), BMW AG (BMW.XE) among others will have to come back to the negotiating table with IG Metall before their current wage contracts expire Sept. 30. \n\n  Unions are showing new resolve after years of being weakened by defections and job losses to globalization, the rank-and-file are demanding their piece of a bumper earnings year after years of wage restraint. \n\n  Another reason is the toll rising inflation is taking on households. The European Central Bank has warned against demanding more pay to compensate, rising a wage-price spiral that will spin a currently 3.2% inflation still higher. But unions are digging in for a fight. \n\n  For public sector workers, the offer of a 5% raise over two years isn't deemed to be nearly enough. \n\n  \"This offer is a joke,\" a 55-year old garbage collector in Frankfurt said while pushing trash cans to the lorry. He has a family and said higher taxes, rising health insurance contributions and rent are exhausting his earnings before the end of the month. \n\n  \"We're ready to go on strike. Three weeks, if necessary. Imagine how this city would look like if we stop taking out its trash. It would be catastrophic.\" His colleagues nod. \n\n  Ver.di union is focusing on inflation in one of the most important wage rounds this year that affect 2.2 million public-sector employees, including private health care and social institutions.   \"We're already thinking of strike strategies that really hurt the employers,\" said Werner Romuender, a labor representative for 320 road sweepers and garbage collectors in the City of Kassel, central Germany. \"Think of striking ticket controllers in public transport: when we announce they'll walk out, why should people get a ticket?\" \n\n  German unions were emboldened by the small GDL train drain drivers union, which after a series of open-ended strikes late last year wrested an 11% pay hike out of the Deutsche Bahn AG national railway. \n\n  \"Our people saw that, of course,\" Romuender said. \"They have a feeling that its time for significantly higher pay.\" \n\n  Many workers left the German unions since the 1990s and Germany had the fewest strikes per hour worked by euro zone standards in recent years. Bargaining power also declined as employers threatened to move abroad. \n\n  \"The atmosphere is generally heated - not only in the steel sector. In many sectors Germans want to participate in the economic success,\" the chairman of the association of steel-sector employers AGV Helmut F. Koch said. \"And we can't say that our sector is ailing.\" \n\n  But the wage demands come amid signs that, after a year of growth, the German economic recovery is losing steam with the rest of the euro zone. \n\n  The European Central Bank has warned that Europe will be affected by the slowdown in the U.S. The German government now expects the export-driven economy to slow to a 1.7% growth rate in 2008 from 2.5% in 2007. \n\n  There are also little signs that consumption could pick up as data show that consumers are unwilling to loosen their purse strings. Rather than adopt the ECB's caution against inflation, the unions take the tack that higher wages could help stimulate domestic demand. \n\n  \"There are signs that the economic growth is retreating in 2008. That's exactly why it is of the essence to strengthen domestic private consumption with higher wages,\" ver.di's chief economist Michael Schlecht said. \n\n  -By Roman Kessler, Dow Jones Newswires, +4969 2972 5514, roman.kessler@dowjones.com \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 12, 2008 09:20 ET (14:20 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253050Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253056Z", "inner_id": 308, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5677, "annotations": [{"id": 4547, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "-AQ6WoUSyP", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.358387Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.358406Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 82.151, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "4994d5bb-b42b-42e2-ad35-410116eae31e", "import_id": 418, "last_action": null, "task": 5677, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "3rd UPDATE: ECB Bini Smaghi:Downside GDP Risk,Upside CPI Risk\n\n \n\n  (Adds further quote on market turmoil.) \n\n \n\n  FLORENCE, Italy (Dow Jones)--Downside risks to growth and upside risks to the inflation rate prevail in the euro zone, senior European Central Bank official Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said Wednesday. \n\n  The next ECB staff projections, due to be released March 6, will contain \"novelties,\" Bini Smaghi said on the sidelines of a conference. The new projections will reflect greater possibilities that growth will slow more than expected, while price trends move higher than anticipated, he said. \n\n  \"Some news is positive, some news is negative,\" he said about recent economic data from the euro zone. Germany's Ifo business sentiment index unexpectedly rose in February, while other indicators have been weakening. \n\n  Bini Smaghi also said the ECB's \"baseline scenario\" is that the U.S. economy won't enter a recession. \"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound,\" he said. \n\n  \"The American economy is being influenced by the financial market turmoil, which in Europe seems to be more limited,\" he added. \n\n  However, a slower U.S. economy will inevitably have an impact on the euro zone, he said. The two large economies may be somewhat diverging, but they are in the same cycle, he said. \n\n  The rising oil and raw materials prices are a \"big worry, because they reflect the scarcity of resources,\" he said. \n\n  \"We have to avoid letting these hikes trigger inflationary forces,\" he added. \"We must limit the effects of (raw material prices) on wages.\" \n\n  The ECB has left interest rates unchanged since credit markets ground to a halt last summer, while offering large-scale liquidity injections into the banking system. \n\n  The market turmoil \"will take some time to be digested,\" Bini Smaghi said. \n\n  The main problem, he added, is that \"banks don't trust each other.\" \n\n  \"Confidence in the financial system's ability to assess some financial instruments has crumbled,\" the central banker said. \n\n  That has stymied the interbank lending market, which in turn has pushed up short-term money market rates. Banks are concerned that counterparty collateral may be exposed to U.S. subprime mortgages and other weakening credits. \n\n  \"It's probably a more complex process than in the past,\" Bini Smaghi said, referring to the current credit market turmoil compared with the Asian crisis of the late 1990s or the crash in technology stocks that began in 2000. \n\n \n\n  -By Luca Di Leo, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-335 617 1960; luca.dileo@dowjones.com \n\n  (Valeria Santoro of MF-Dow Jones in Florence contributed to this report.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 27, 2008 09:58 ET (14:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253080Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253086Z", "inner_id": 309, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5678, "annotations": [{"id": 4548, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "W_gulMX_5b", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.358480Z", "updated_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.358496Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 94.75, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "unique_id": "663189e4-ae79-4308-bc48-e34707a537bf", "import_id": 419, "last_action": null, "task": 5678, "project": 8, "updated_by": null, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Low &amp; Bonar FY Pretax Profit GBP19.1M Vs GBP9.8M &gt;LWB.LN\n\nLow & Bonar \nYear ended 30.11 \n()=Loss/Debit \nFigs in GBPm and pence (p), unless otherwise stated. \n                       2007      2006 \n \nRevenue               311.8     224.5 \nOperating profit       22.8      12.1 \nPre-except profit*     22.4      14.7 \nPretax profit          19.1       9.8 \nEPS basic              8.60p     5.80p \nEPS diluted            8.46p     5.72p \nFinal dividend          3.1p     2.80p \nTotal dividend         4.85p     4.38p \n \n * before amortisation and non-recurring items \n \n\n  * A strong performance across the business with both Divisions delivering growth in sales, profit and market share. \n\n \n\n  * Technical Textiles Division benefited strongly from the successful integration of the Colbond and Geo-Tipptex acquisitions and enhanced operating margins.

Public-sector wages rose 1.0% in the quarter and increased 4.1% from a year earlier. \n\n  Wages including bonuses rose 1.1% in the quarter and rose 4.5% on the year. \n\n  ICAP chief economist Matthew Johnson says while the figures were as-expected, it still pointed to the RBA remained poised for a round of near-term tightening. \n\n  \"That trend in the private sector data is a little bit worrying and that would reflect what the RBA is saying about these sorts of wage pressures out there,\" Johnson said. \n\n  \"There is nothing in this data to suggest that the RBA was wrong to be worried about wages...however, there is nothing in the data that really sounds the alarm bells.\" \n\n  In the last week-and-a-half, the central bank has delivered several warnings the wage increases were beginning to spill over into price chains. \n\n  On Tuesday, RBA assistant governor Malcolm Edey said there had been some very recent evidence of higher wages growth. \n\n  This adds to what the RBA said in its very hawkish quarterly statement on monetary policy released last week, which all but confirmed a March rate hike. \n\n  The minutes from the RBA's Feb. 5 meeting, when it voted to lift rates a quarter of a percentage point to 7.0%, revealed Tuesday the central bank had even considered a 50 basis point increase this month. \n\n  TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said   wages growth remained uncomfortably high for the RBA at current levels. \n\n  \"The RBA still has an inflation headache to deal with,\" he said. \n\n  \"Broadly speaking, wages appear to be edging higher and for the RBA to soften its hawkish policy stance, the data needed to have a downward surprise. \n\n  \"On an annualized basis, wages look to be heading from 4.0% to more than 4.5% year-on-year, and the RBA will view that as a threat to inflation.\" \n\n  ANZ senior economist Tony Pearson said the annual rate of growth in private sector wages was the highest reading since the series started in 1998. \n\n  \"There's still evidence of a gradual swelling of wage pressures,\" he said. \n\n  \"There hasn't been a wage breakout in the sense of a sharp uptick, but it does indicate a gradual acceleration of private sector wages. \n\n  \"That's the series we've been focused on from a policy perspective.\" \n\n  However, other data released Wednesday pointed to a moderation in the economy. \n\n  The Westpac-Melbourne Institute economic leading indicator grew at an annualized rate of 4.7% in December, down from 6.1% in November, suggesting a moderation in the likely pace of economic growth toward long-term trend levels in the next three to nine months. \n\n  And an index of job vacancies for skilled workers in Australia fell by 2.2% in February from January, and was 6.4% lower from a year ago, the Department of Employment said. \n\n  The index currently stands at 97.7. \n\n  Despite the on-consensus wages date, the Australian dollar sold off as traders took back short positions on news the data weren't higher than expected. \n\n  The Australian dollar fell to US$0.9174 when the figures were published at 0030 GMT, from US$0.9194 earlier. At 0101 GMT, the Australian dollar was US$0.9191.

But the coalition is expected to easily win again, although with fewer seats. \n\n  Petronas posted a net profit of MYR46.4 billion for the fiscal year ending March 2007.

(RTP) continues to play hardball with steel makers and is holding out for a more-than-71% increase in contract prices with Asian mills. \n\n  London-based Rio Tinto, the world's second-biggest iron ore exporter, is defying convention and refusing to step into line with a price rise of between 66% and 71% agreed to by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) last month. Rio's Australian iron ore mines are much closer to Asia than those of Brazil's Vale, and Rio says steel mills should pay extra because they don't have to ship the material as far. \n\n  Rio Tinto will \"do what we can to secure an appropriate return for our shareholders,\" iron ore unit chief Sam Walsh said Wednesday at a conference in Perth, referring to Rio Tinto's push for a price rise higher than those secured by Vale. Rio Tinto's ore continues to be sold \"without the premium we believe it merits for being so much cheaper to import than iron ore from elsewhere.\" \n\n  Usually the world's three big iron producers - Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton (BHP) - fall into line once one of them secures a contract with a major steel maker for the Japanese fiscal year. But Rio Tinto is this year defending a takeover bid from BHP and doing all it can to boost its bottom line. BHP, which is yet to settle contracts but hasn't publicly said it is looking for an extra hike, unsuccessfully held out for a freight premium in 2005. \n\n  Walsh said spot prices are now US$100 a metric ton more than current contract prices and have risen by US$20 a ton since Vale settled. Spot prices in China and India rose as high as US$216/ton March 1, according to Merrill Lynch, still about 50% higher than the new price secured by Vale for Japanese fiscal 2008, which starts April 1. \n\n  Unusually, Vale's deal this year included two different price categories, with higher quality ore getting a 71% gain. \n\n \n   No Rush To Settle \n \n\n  The recent gains in the spot market mean Rio Tinto is prepared to be patient and won't rush to follow Vale's earlier-than-expected settlement. Also, with iron representing a bigger slice of Rio Tinto's bottom line than BHP's, a bigger price hike would work in favor of defending BHP's all-stock bid. \n\n  \"We are sitting tight, waiting for the market to recognize the fundamentals,\" Walsh said, adding a deal with its steel mill customers isn't imminent. \"I'd remind you that a couple of years ago, it wasn't until June that the price was settled.\" \n\n  Merrill Lynch analysts said they expect Australian iron ore producers to achieve a minimum 71% hike, which is the price rise Vale gained for its better-quality Carajas ore. \n\n  \"We were surprised the (Vale) settlement was so early, and that the increase was not higher,\" Merrill Lynch said in a research note this week, adding Vale's talks about merging with Xstrata PLC (XTA.LN) may have  influenced the timing. \"A higher price increase would have been supported by the elevated spot prices, supply disruptions, the tight steel markets and strong Chinese demand.\" \n\n  The iron ore miners achieved contract gains of 9.5% in 2007, 19% in 2006 and 71.5% in 2005. In recent years, negotiations have tended to stretch past the April 1 start of the Japanese fiscal year. \n\n  Walsh said he expects the current system of setting benchmark contract prices to change gradually, but doesn't expect to see miners and mills \"rushing to an LME-based system with futures.\" Late last year, BHP said it favors an index pricing system for iron ore sales. \n\n  Merrill Lynch said a new, third-party managed iron ore index \"appears inevitable\" in two or three years. \n\n \n\n  -By Matt Chambers and Stephen Bell, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9671-4393;  matt.chambers@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 12, 2008 02:26 ET (06:26 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253205Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:15:25.817625Z", "inner_id": 313, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5682, "annotations": [{"id": 5578, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "2xImv0ikcr", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T17:18:11.026065Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:18:11.026090Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 164.442, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "66c273f5-e5a0-4dfa-9214-2e7b7509ae1f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5682, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Indian Bonds Fall On Inflation Concerns; Rupee Weakens\n\n \n                   As Of 1200 GMT \n                   Latest     Change \n USD/INR           40.10       +0.20 \n 7.99% 2017 Bond   7.94%       +4BPs \n Call Rate         7.00%       +100 BPs \n Forward Dollar Premium/Discount* \n March              0.68        +0.07 \n *Forward Dollar Premium/Discount is midpoint of bid-offer spreads. \n \n\n  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--Indian government bond prices fell Monday on speculation that a sharp increase in the inflation rate may prompt the central bank to take action to curb rising prices before its scheduled monetary policy review at the end of April, traders said. \n\n  The benchmark 7.99% 2017-dated bond ended at INR100.30, down from INR100.52 at Friday's close.

The Bank of England has cut its target rate just twice since December, by just a half percentage point in total. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan haven't touched rates since credit problems emerged last year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been raising rates, with the most recent increase coming yesterday. \n\n  ECB and Bank of England policy makers meet this week and are expected to keep rates unchanged. Despite signs of economic weakness, inflation in Europe and the United Kingdom has been high, making them reluctant to pursue stimulative rate cuts. \n\n  Why the disconnect? The Fed might be on the wrong course. Many complain its easy-money policy is fueling global commodity inflation, making it harder for other central banks to do their jobs. \n\n  Another possibility is that other nations are insulated from America's woes and are correctly staying out of the U.S. mess. If the global economy was really slowing, this argument goes, commodity prices would be falling, not soaring. \n\n  A third possibility, and probably the most likely, is that the rest of the world will eventually have to catch up to the Fed. The Australian central bank, even as it raised interest rates, noted tighter credit conditions and softer business and consumer sentiment in commodity-rich Australia and warned that \"global growth will be below trend in 2008.\" Canada's central bank has also gotten into the rate-cutting act, saying the U.S. slump would have \"significant spillover effects on the global economy.\" \n\n  Central bank easing policies will eventually converge, says Lena Komileva, Group-of-Seven economist at Tullett Prebon. The slow response of others means their economies might keep slowing even after a U.S. recovery sets in. \n\n \n\n  Corporate Insiders Decide \n\n  It's Time to Buy Shares \n\n \n\n  Here's a silver lining in the market. Corporate executives are gobbling up their own companies' shares. \n\n  Insider buying in February was 26% higher than the average for the month over the past six years, while selling was about half the average, Thomson Financial says. Nearly half of the buying came from large-cap companies, including hard-hit financial and technology companies. \n\n  Some investors watch how executives treat their own companies' shares; they might buy when seeing opportunities other investors don't. \n\n  \"I like to see that management thinks their company is at a price that represents some value,\" says Robert Pavlik, chief investment officer at Oaktree Asset Management. \n\n  The catch is that insiders aren't always the smartest money or the best signal about a stock. Sometimes executives don't know what's about to hit them, or they're buying or selling for reasons that don't mesh with the rest of the market. Despite a number of MBIA insider buys in late 2007, for example, the shares are down more than 30% this year. \n\n  -- Scott Patterson \n\n  --- \n\n  Email mark.gongloff@wsj.com or scott.patterson@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 04, 2008 23:04 ET (04:04 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253267Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:19:55.355405Z", "inner_id": 315, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5684, "annotations": [{"id": 5580, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "fxrPR4nX-8", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T17:26:23.578845Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:26:23.578872Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 387.507, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d730b913-fa30-4b4d-a691-01216f7d21aa", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5684, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Indian Govt Bonds Rise On Lower Crude Oil Prices; Rupee Up\n\n \n                   As Of 1200 GMT \n                   Latest     Change \n USD/INR           40.51       -0.22 \n 7.99% 2017 Bond   7.59%       -3 BPs \n Call Rate         6.05%       -145 BPs \n Forward Dollar Premium/Discount* \n February          0.50        +0.05 \n *Forward Dollar Premium/Discount is midpoint of bid-offer spreads. \n \n\n  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--Indian government bonds rose Tuesday as a retreat in global crude oil prices provided a respite from the recent upward surge in commodity prices, dealers said. \n\n  The benchmark 7.99% 2017 10-year bond ended at INR102.63, up from INR102.39 Monday.

The latest in a series of rate cuts is likely to widen the differential between India and the U.S. to 5.75 percentage points and may give a boost to dwindling capital inflows into India. \n\n  But some analysts say rate arbitrage may not be enough to ease the rupee's depreciation. \n\n  \"Even if the Fed cuts its rates further, I'm not sure how much role a wider rate arbitrage will play in attracting foreign funds if the equities sentiment remains damp...

Increasingly complex and costly compliance costs of manufacturing in our home countries have not assisted,\" Bongard said. \n\n  He added that \"free trade agreements with low cost labor countries like China and Thailand have created a playing field we are unable to compete in.\" \n\n  Bongard's comments sparked a swift reaction from New Zealand Minister of Trade Phil Goff. \n\n  \"I do not believe...that free trade agreements by New Zealand, such as that with China, are a key factor in the decision to relocate,\" Goff said in a statement. \n\n   Around 1,070 of the company's employees will lose their jobs as a result of the move, including 430 from its Range & DishDrawer factory in Dunedin, New Zealand. \n\n  Rickey Ward, joint domestic equity manager at Tyndall Investment Management, said the decision had been forced upon the company by several factors. \n\n  \"This is a reflection of the current economic environment and the challenges that a company like this faces when it tries to grow,\" said Ward. \n\n  Ward said that the move was positive as Fisher & Paykel Appliances will be closer to its main markets, curbing transport costs. \n\n  \"Getting closer to your markets is a better idea for them and to a certain extent this is quite reflective of that, trying to get closer to markets where they have got growth,\" he said. \n\n   Investors cheered the company's move, sending the stock surging 13.6% to a five-week high of NZ$2.50 around 0133 GMT. The spike came after the stock slid to  NZ$2.11 Wednesday, the lowest level since its split from Fisher & Paykel Healthcare  in late 2001. \n\n  \"Here is a company that was somewhat beaten up because of short-term news, clearly if the numbers are to be believed from what (CEO John Bongard) was saying it will be enormously beneficial to the share price,\" Ward said. \n\n \n\n  Relocation Benefits \n\n \n\n  Fisher & Paykel Appliances mainly operates in New Zealand, Australia, the U.S. and Europe. \n\n  According to the company, the move is expected to save at least NZ$50 million a year. \n\n  The Range & DishDrawer factory in Dunedin, New Zealand, along with the refrigerator plant in Brisbane, Australia and the Dynamic Cooking Systems or DCS cooking factory in California, U.S. will all be relocated over the next 12-18 months. \n\n  Fisher & Paykel Appliances was already in the process of moving some of its electronics and laundry appliances facilities to Thailand in a bid to compete with low-cost rivals. \n\n  It will make use of that site, existing sites in Italy and a new refrigeration production plant it has agreed to buy in Mexico from Whirlpool Corp. for US$33 million. \n\n  The remaining production facilities in Auckland, New Zealand (Refrigeration and Production Machinery Ltd), Ohio, U.S. (Laundry) and Borso del Grappa, Italy (Cooking) will not be affected, the company said. \n\n  Hamilton Hindin Greene adviser James Smalley said: \"Its just a reflection of the fact that if companies want to remain competitive in the global environment they've got to minimize their costs as much as they can.\" \n\n  There will be a one-off cost of approximately NZ$50 million and the capital expenditure is estimated around NZ$100 million. \n\n  The cost of the moves will be substantially funded from the sale of what will become surplus property in New Zealand and Australia,\" and expected to net NZ$100 million, the company added. \n\n  The head office will remain located in New Zealand and the products will continue to be developed in New Zealand by Fisher & Paykel Appliances engineers, said Bongard. \n\n \n\n  - By Rebecca Howard, Dow Jones Newswires; 64-4-471-5990; rebecca.howard@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 16, 2008 21:38 ET (01:38 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253329Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:28:56.199229Z", "inner_id": 317, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5686, "annotations": [{"id": 5582, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "wr2VJPl8lc", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T17:31:09.896123Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:31:09.896148Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 132.944, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a095d869-bbe9-4ac1-9f7f-de84ed147468", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5686, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "2nd UPDATE:Haiti Lawmakers Vote To Dismiss PM Over Food Riots\n\n \n\n  (Updates with more comment from Haitians, U.N. mission) \n\n \n\n  PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)--Haitian lawmakers on Saturday dismissed Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis, hoping to defuse widespread anger of rising food prices that had led to days of deadly protests and looting. \n\n  President Rene Preval, who earlier in the day announced plans to cut the price of rice, immediately said he would seek a replacement for Alexis, who took office in 2006 with Preval's backing to head a Cabinet meant to unite the poor and fractious nation. \n\n  \"I think that will satisfy the people,\" said Sen. Youri Latortue following the vote in parliament in which 16 of 27 lawmakers backed Alexis' ouster. Latortue said lawmakers ousted the prime minister because he did not boost food production and refused to set a date for the departure of U.N. peacekeepers. \n\n  But about 25 people gathered outside the national palace after the dismissal, chanting \"Aristide or death,\" in reference to exiled former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. \n\n  U.N. peacekeepers called Alexis' dismissal a \"serious setback\" and said they look forward to the early appointment of a new government, according to mission spokeswoman Sophie Boutaud de la Combe. \n\n  The prime minister's ouster reflects frustration over soaring food prices in a nation where most people live on less than $2 a day and chronic hunger had become unbearable in recent months. \n\n  The rage erupted in days violent clashes with U.N. peacekeepers and looting across Haiti that had abated by late Thursday, but not before leaving five people dead. Protesters even stormed the presidential palace on Tuesday, charging its main gate with a rolling dumpster and yelling for Preval to step down. \n\n  On Saturday, U.N. military commander Maj. Gen. Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz told The Associated Press that calm was returning across the country, with some transportation resuming and people going back to work. \n\n  But Haiti could encounter more chaos with Alexis' ousting, according to Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin America and Caribbean Center at Florida International University. He said the dismissal creates a political vacuum and that senators might now go after Preval because he hasn't implemented many changes. \n\n  \"President Preval has to be careful. Anytime President Preval has to engage himself speaking, he also needs to engage the private sector in his discussions,\" said Senator Jean Hector Anacasis, a member of Preval's Lespwa party. \n\n  Emmanuel Joseph, a 26-year-old from the seaside slum of Cite Soleil, said residents there are still planning to protest Monday because they are hungry. \n\n  Some residents felt their plight wouldn't improve regardless of the dismissal. \n\n  \"Alexis left? What's the difference?\" asked Jackson Aubri, a 28-year-old chicken vendor. \n\n  In another bid to deal with anger of food prices, Preval said Saturday that the price of a 50-pound bag of rice will drop from $51 to $43. \n\n  The price reduction went into effect immediately and will last for one month, at which point government officials will reassess the economic situation. \n\n  The Haitian president said the government will use international aid money to subsidize the price of rice and that the private sector has agreed to knock $3 off the price of each bag. \n\n  Globally, food prices have risen 40% since mid-2007. Haiti is particularly affected because it imports nearly all of its food, including more than 80% of its rice. Much of its once-productive farmland has been abandoned as farmers struggle to grow crops in soil decimated by erosion, deforestation, flooding and tropical storms. \n\n  On Friday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement banning government officials from traveling to Haiti following the violent demonstrations. \n\n  It also advised American citizens to consider leaving the impoverished Caribbean country where protests over high costs of living left five dead in the countryside. The warning comes despite a general sense of calm settling over Port-au-Prince. \n\n  \"If you don't need to stay, you might consider departing,\" said James Ellickson-Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. \n\n  An estimated 19,000 U.S. citizens live in Haiti, most dual-nationals who live in the capital. More than 140 American citizens have been kidnapped since 2005, but few were short-term visitors, the U.S. Embassy said. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 12, 2008 16:54 ET (20:54 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253361Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:31:10.143306Z", "inner_id": 318, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5687, "annotations": [{"id": 5583, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "1lKWceDyz4", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T17:37:33.950267Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:37:33.950283Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-02T17:37:10.877093Z", "lead_time": 383.051, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d70175f1-f462-4e6a-a0ff-974c56177e57", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5687, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJ(4/23) Philippines Pressed To Rethink Rice Subsidies\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n   By James Hookway in Manila and Karen Lane in Singapore \n\n  Asia has enough rice stocks to meet demand despite low inventories, according to the Asian Development Bank, but prices are showing no sign of receding. \n\n  Some politicians and economists are pressing the Philippines -- the world's biggest importer of rice -- to change how it subsidizes the staple grain because of the distortions such measures can introduce into the rice market. \n\n  Rice prices have risen 150% this year, with Thai medium grade rice -- a de facto benchmark -- reaching a record $960 a ton this week. The reasons for the run-up include rising demand among fast-growing Asian economies, poor harvests and stiff competition from biofuels for cultivated land. But some economists and politicians say the impact is being exacerbated by the way some governments restrict exports or distort the market through elaborate and corruption-prone subsidies. \n\n  In the Philippines, Sen. Edgardo Angara is among a small but growing movement of people asking the government to give up subsidies that are designed to make rice affordable to the poorest Filipinos, but that distort the market and lead to hoarding. Mr. Angara argues that the Philippines' state-run National Food Authority should give up its monopolistic powers to import and subsidize rice and leave the job to the private sector. \n\n  \"If private rice traders are allowed to import and sell rice without any restriction, the supply and price of rice will likely stabilize,\" he said in a speech to the Senate on Monday. Mr. Angara, who once served as secretary of agriculture, also pressed his case to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo during a legislative conference Tuesday. \n\n  Rajat Nag, managing director general of the Asian Development Bank, told reporters in Singapore Tuesday that steps taken by some countries to curb rice exports or introduce price controls are having \"counterproductive effects\" on what farmers choose to plant and when. Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia have limited rice exports, increasing the demand for rice from the biggest exporter, Thailand. Mr. Nag said export bans could hurt other countries and damage longer-term trade relations. \n\n  He added that Asia shouldn't panic about rice supplies because the region has enough stocks to cover demand, even though they are at their lowest level in decades. \n\n  The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization this month forecast this year's global rice production will expand 1.8% from a year earlier, relieving the pressure on prices. In the Philippines, removing rice subsidies would help eliminate theft and corruption in the state-controlled rice-distribution systems, Mr. Angara says. \n\n  Philippine investigators have filed several complaints against rice traders who have taken subsidized rice and repackaged it for sale at double the price on the commercial market -- pricing out many poorer Filipinos who were supposed to get it. With the money saved from scrapping subsidies -- projected to be at least $1.3 billion this year -- the Philippines could establish a fund to directly provide money to the people who most need it to buy rice, said Mr. Angara. He said the Philippines did this during previous rice shortages. \n\n  Perhaps most important, the Philippines also could invest money now spent to subsidize rice consumption on improving its rice output, Mr. Angara says. Like the Philippines, many governments in the region have assumed they would be able to easily and cheaply make up shortfalls in domestic production on the international market. But as this year has shown, stable pricing can't always be taken for granted. \n\n  Ms. Arroyo has earmarked $1 billion to improve the country's rice-producing capabilities and has called for a freeze on converting agricultural land into housing or industrial developments in a bid to jump-start a new wave of rice farming. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 22, 2008 19:54 ET (23:54 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253394Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:37:34.161832Z", "inner_id": 319, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5688, "annotations": [{"id": 5584, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "5hd7rzyFgQ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T17:38:37.592428Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:38:37.592464Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-02T17:38:37.289911Z", "lead_time": 62.721, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3a40b676-d944-40cb-a327-5b75dd54ee9c", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5688, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UPDATE:UAE Carrefour To Keep 52 Basic Foods At 07 Prices\n\n \n\n  (Adds further Carrefour comments, analyst comment) \n\n  DUBAI (Zawya Dow Jones)--MAF Hypermarkets signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Economy Thursday to maintain the 2007 prices of 52 basic food commodities in all Carrefour stores in the Persian Gulf state. \n\n  The MoU is in line with \"continuous efforts by the   Ministry to stabilize prices, reduce inflation levels, maintain market balance and protect the consumer,\" said Mohammed Al Shihhi, undersecretary at the Ministry of Economy. \n\n  The government aims to reduce inflation in the U.A.E. from 10.9% to 5% this year through a series of economic measures, but not through dropping its peg to the weak dollar which economists say accounts for up to 40% of total inflation in the country. \n\n  Food items that will have prices capped include rice, eggs, milk, meat, bread, tea, water, sugar, salt, vegetable oil and beans among others. \n\n  The initiative, which applies to all buyers regardless of whether they are U.A.E. nationals or expatriates, will be effective from Sunday till December 2008, said Henri Changeux, Senior Vice President of Carrefour. \n\n  Up to 70% of the items on the list are Carrefour's most popular brands and Carrefour will not be raising prices of other goods to make up for the expected loss in revenues, Changeux said, adding the initiative was part of its \"social responsibility\". \n\n  \"We support this initiative, our job is to fulfill the needs of the customer at the best price,\" Changeux told reporters at a press conference in Dubai. \n\n  Last week Lulu Hypermarket Group signed a similar MoU to cap prices of 32 goods.

But while these factors remain, on the surface at least, ongoing bullish factors for copper, the weight of speculative money and fears that the U.S. recession will spread are new themes that are continually cropping up. \n\n  Opinions over copper's future price direction remain mixed, with the sector looking to CESCO to provide sentiment going forward. \n\n  \"Metal markets seem to be torn between rallying on the back of a weaker dollar on the one hand, and selling off on those occasions when the realization sets in that slowing growth, which is driving the dollar lower in the first place, has the potential to knock demand back,\" said U.S.-based MF Global analyst Ed Meir. \n\n  \"How this tussle eventually plays out remains to be seen, but the demand component will eventually prevail and exert downward pressure on metals,\" he added. \n\n  This will be especially true if the U.S. slowdown starts to spread to Europe, Japan, and then on to Asian economies, as may already be happening, Meir noted. \n\n  Yet for the moment, market sentiment remains mostly in a bullish mood, optimistic that any recession in the U.S. will be short-lived, and more than offset by strength from China and other emerging markets. And for sure, the latest round of generally poor economic data out of the U.S. is still failing to deter investors. \n\n  \"The copper market obviously sees solid fundamental value in the medium term, given prices edged higher (last week) on the back of U.S. economic data that in other circumstances would have sent investors running,\" said Michael Lewis, Deutsche Bank's global head of commodities research. \n\n  \"The institute of Supply Management's manufacturing and non-manufacturing monthly indices both came in at levels that indicate a contraction in the economy, but copper investors took heart because they both came in higher than the previous month,\" he added. \n\n  While this positive attitude is undoubtedly helping to sustain copper prices, traders are now starting to warn that a more cautious approach is needed. Noting copper prices have exceeded pre-credit crunch levels, traders said this is partly because the market has adapted to the new environment, and partly because analyst reports remain staunchly bullish, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve officially using the word 'recession.' \n\n  \"This sort of frank Fed-speak talk is very rare and surely an omen of what is really coming down the pipe,\" said RBC Capital Market's London-based director and head of base metals Alex Heath. \n\n  Noting that bullish commentaries on a weak dollar boosting demand amid low inventories and supply side worries \"have been the underlying support of the metal for a while now,\" Heath said that \"ultimately the reason we may make new contract highs (in copper) in the short term is the power of investment money as it feeds on momentum.\" \n\n \n   Copper A Speculative Bubble? \n \n\n  Investor flows into commodities have been well documented for some time now, and are widely viewed as a new fundamental factor in the market. While it's difficult to quantify the exact worth of this money flow, consensus estimates calculate that around $30 billion of fresh investment entered commodities in the first quarter of the year. \n\n  While this has driven prices higher, copper's also slumped as investors reassessed likely commodity-demand levels - and therefore also prices - after their bull run. And this realization that copper price appreciation is no longer a safe one-way bet has brought fears that copper may be a speculative bubble waiting to burst. \n\n  What makes it difficult for participants to be sure that investor flows are top-heavy and that copper is set for a sharp decline is the fact that supply/demand fundamentals for the industrial metal have so far proven to be much stronger than expected in 2008. \n\n  This is largely on account of ongoing supply losses at the mine level, and weather-related production problems at Chinese smelters and refineries at the start of the year. \n\n  Even output in Chile, the world's biggest copper producer and home to the world's largest mines, is coming under scrutiny. \n\n  State-owned producer Codelco, the world's largest, has been hit by falling production over the last few years, and this will fall again due to declining ore grades and delays to new projects, the company has said. \n\n  The threat of strikes is a current and very serious problem, while energy, water and sulfuric acid shortages are also threatening to crimp already reduced output. Around 25% of the world's copper production relies on acid to process oxide ores, and with the raw material at record high prices, this is an additional burden to smaller producers in particular. \n\n  Looking ahead, new production growth is under threat. Countries like Congo and Zambia are widely expected to see delays to new projects and larger projects, analysts said, with energy problems once again rearing their head. \n\n  Even larger projects like Tenke Fungurume, KOV and Kolwezi Tailings could encounter further delays, given severe electricity shortages in Congo's Katanga Province. \n\n  According to Credit Suisse analyst Jeremy Gray, who recently visited Congo, much of the spare power in the region has now been taken by smaller Chinese copper smelters that are producing between 100,000 to 150,000 tons of contained blister copper. \n\n  \"As the license review in Congo dragged on, the Chinese used the window to take the spare power away from many of the larger projects,\" Gray said. \"Tenke, KOV and Kolwezi Tailings may only account for some 500,000 tons of additional supply, but in our estimates, they still account for 11% of future copper supply in the next six years,\" he added. \n\n  All this as copper stocks in global warehouses continue to slide. There have been numerous conspiracy theories over this, including that hedge funds and merchants have been buying metal to store it in private warehouses or ship it between ports so it doesn't show up in supply and demand statistics, making the market look tighter as a result. \n\n  If this is true, it seems to be working. Official data suggests that although demand in the rest of the world will be at best flat this year, analysts said the fate of the copper market rests squarely on the shoulders of China, which accounts for over 25% of world demand. \n\n  With CESCO week set to discuss whether China has truly decoupled from the developed world or not, data so far suggests that Chinese copper demand is be around 10%-12% this year. \n\n  While this is down from over 20% last year, largely due to a drop in the export portion, analysts said the domestic portion looks likely to stay strong. Apparent copper demand growth has slowed in the past two months not due to any slowdown in underlying consumption, analysts say, but due to bad winter weather and the surge in copper prices discouraging buying. \n\n  If world demand for copper re-accelerates once more, it will catch many consumers, who've been living hand-to-mouth, unawares. But if it doesn't, and the weight of investment money heads for the exit, copper's future price gains look anything but assured. \n\n \n\n  -By Andrea Hotter, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9413; andrea.hotter@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 06, 2008 20:33 ET (00:33 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253463Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T17:54:39.638225Z", "inner_id": 321, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5690, "annotations": [{"id": 5602, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "kx3H-jPO2W", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T18:10:29.233787Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T18:10:29.233812Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 948.757, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "1acb78e0-a69a-48c4-9f2f-e4e68731c02d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5690, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Vietnam Rice Export Prices Up 10% On Tight Local Supply\n\n \n\n  HANOI (Dow Jones)--Export prices of Vietnamese rice were 10% higher in the week ended Tuesday after the government reaffirmed that the country will only export between 3.5 million and 4.0 million tons of rice, due to tight local supply, traders said.

The government sees futures markets as contributors to India's staggering rise in food prices and banned futures trading in rice and wheat last year. Last week, it banned futures trading in soy oil, chick peas, potatoes and rubber for at least four months. \n\n  But critics said the ban will exacerbate rather than relieve inflation by shutting down valuable market-pricing mechanisms and encouraging traders to move to the country's untaxed and unregulated black market of so-called dabba traders. \n\n  The new suspensions came as a surprise after a government-appointed committee reported last month that it couldn't find any conclusive evidence that futures trading drove up prices. It declined to recommend a trading suspension. But with national elections coming within a year, the ruling coalition, which is led by the Congress Party, faces protests and dissent from left-wing partners, who have been clamoring for action to bring down the price of food staples. \n\n  Even some in the government have doubts that the suspension will have an effect on prices. \"We were opposed to the suspensions,\" said B.C. Khatua, chairman of the Forwards Markets Commission, which supervises the country's futures exchanges. \"But in a democracy, you have to compromise.\" \n\n  India's futures markets include only a small proportion of the participants in the agricultural sector. The average daily volume traded on the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange, the main market for agricultural futures, is $600 million. India's overall agricultural output was $129 billion in 2006, the latest data available. The small size of the market means that, at best, it has little effect on food prices and, at worst, it can be easily manipulated by relatively small sums of money, traders and analysts said. \n\n  One major concern is that banning futures trading takes away early warnings about price jumps. Farmers, who could look to futures prices as a gauge of the market, now have little alternative but to sell at the spot-market price. \n\n  Futures trading represents \"the canary in the coal mine,\" said Ajay Shah, senior fellow at the government-funded National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. \"It's not right to blame futures trading as the cause of price rises.\" \n\n  The government has made the case that global factors and speculation are pushing up food prices as much as supply-and-demand issues. \"Worse than a price rise is the sentiment of a price rise; worse than inflation is the fear of inflation,\" Kamal Nath, minister of Commerce and Industry, said in a recent interview. \"People tend to stock up and create artificial demand.\" \n\n  Many traders and analysts said that if inflation doesn't dissipate, a wider ban on agricultural-futures trading is likely. The government said it has no such plans now. \n\n  Already, the suspensions on futures trading may be pushing more people to dabba traders. These illegal brokers take prices from official exchanges and let individuals \"buy\" commodities. However, unlike in the official markets, no actual deliverable product is involved in the transaction, and buyers are just betting on changes in prices. Such traders -- dabba means \"box\" in Hindi -- aren't taxed or regulated, leaving participants with little security if a broker turns hostile. \"Because the Indian commodities-futures market is not allowed to operate, people feel aggrieved and go into this type of trading to keep their risk management maintained,\" said Mr. Khatua, of the Forwards Markets Commission. \n\n  Even as India clamps down on futures trading at home, it quietly has been placing its own orders on wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade, two people familiar with the situation said. Over the past year, the government slowly has built up a stack of options to buy 100 million tons of wheat in case of domestic shortages -- a stance some saw as hypocritical, considering the government's stance on futures trading in India. Government officials couldn't be reached to comment over the weekend. \n\n  --- \n\n  Joanna Slater in New York contributed to this article. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 11, 2008 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253561Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T18:14:52.160080Z", "inner_id": 324, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5693, "annotations": [{"id": 5613, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "VOLcNR2fUL", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T18:15:56.678034Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T18:15:56.678060Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 63.733, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "65edfd97-1482-424b-bc05-81eb76023661", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5693, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "2nd UPDATE:ECB Draghi:CPI Main Threat As Fincl Storm Not Over\n\n \n\n  (Adds Draghi remarks, background) \n\n \n\n  ROME (Dow Jones)--European Central Bank board member Mario Draghi Saturday said the recent buildup in inflationary pressures following the sharp rise in energy and food prices, coupled with the U.S. economic slowdown, represented the major threats to the world economy. \n\n  He added that it was too early to say whether the financial turbulence - stemming from the U.S. mortgage crisis that began in August 2007- was over. \n\n  \"The principal source of concern remains the continued rise in the price of energy and other raw materials,\" said Draghi, who heads the Bank of Italy and the Financial Stability Forum, a global panel of regulators charged with monitoring the financial market crisis. \n\n  The central banker said the price increase in energy and other commodities were \"having a recessionary impact on the advanced economies and feeding inflation, thus constraining the monetary policy stance.\" \n\n  Record oil prices and the recent surge in food prices are creating major headaches for central bankers around the world, which risk stoking inflation by lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. Moreover, the recent price rises are eroding households' purchasing power, hurting consumer spending and the wider economy. \n\n  The inflation rate in the euro zone hit a 16-year high in May as oil prices surged, reinforcing a growing consensus that the ECB won't cut its key interest rate this year. Consumer prices in the 15 countries that use the euro rose 3.6% from a year earlier in May, keeping the rate above the ECB's target ceiling of just under 2% for the ninth straight month. \n\n  Draghi, who helps set ECB monetary policy in the 15-country euro zone, said the central bank had successfully managed to keep inflation under control, with higher consumer prices not translating into higher wages for now. \n\n  \"The firm anchoring of inflation expectations has allowed the European Central Bank to keep interest rates unchanged for quite some time, thus helping to support the economy,\" Draghi said, adding the ECB remains firmly focused on its medium-term price stability objective. \n\n  His remarks are likely to reinforce expectations that the ECB will continue to keep rates on hold this year. While the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have cut interest rates in recent months to boost economic growth, the ECB has left its main rate unchanged since June 2007 to keep a lid on inflation. \n\n  Turning to the market crisis, Draghi said it was too early to say whether the financial turbulence was over. He said that although tensions in some markets were easing, normal conditions have yet to be restored. \n\n  \"The financial turmoil that swept over the major advanced economies brought to an end a long period of growth, low inflation and plentiful credit. It is too early to say that it has passed,\" Draghi said, adding it was also too soon to assess its full impact on the world economy. \n\n  The central banker said that the financial system that will emerge from the current crisis must have different rules, less debt and more capital. \n\n  As head of the Financial Stability Forum, Draghi last month presented a report to the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations that included a series of recommendations for major financial firms, central banks, regulatory bodies and other groups to improve transparency in the financial system and address lax risk-management practices that contributed to the current market crisis. \n\n \n\n  -By Luca Di Leo, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-06-6782543; luca.dileo@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 31, 2008 06:55 ET (10:55 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253601Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T18:15:56.912696Z", "inner_id": 325, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5694, "annotations": [{"id": 5614, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "-nm1cZwjwX", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-02T18:17:31.875420Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T18:17:31.875446Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 94.168, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "1b4101fa-edee-4b82-b5d8-7e5ce22f6c85", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5694, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "UPDATE: Thai Refiners Asked To Cut Ex-Refinery Diesel Price\n\n \n\n  (Adds government's plan to ask more refiners to cut prices.) \n\n \n\n  BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--Thailand's Energy Minister Poonpirom Liptapanlop said Monday the ministry has asked oil refiners owned by state-run oil and gas conglomerate PTT PCL (PTT.TH) to cut the ex-refinery price of diesel products by up to THB1 per liter for six months. \n\n  The move, which would lower refining margins, is designed to soften the blow to the domestic economy from record global oil prices. \n\n  Refineries under PTT - Thai Oil PCL (TOP.TH), PTT Aromatics & Refining PCL (PTTAR.TH), IRPC PCL (IRPC.TH) and Bangchak Petroleum PCL (BCP.TH) - will consider the request and get back to the ministry next week, said PTT President Prasert Bunsumpun after meeting with officials. \n\n  The four companies account for 70% of the country's refining capacity of about 1 million barrels a day.

Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has decided that crude oil prices edging toward $140 a barrel are too high. \n\n  That's spurred talk of Saudi output climbing to 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1981. \n\n  The planned rise will be the showpiece of an oil producer-consumer meeting called by the king for June 22 in Jeddah. The big question for the oil market is whether Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and de facto OPEC leader, can pump enough oil to bring prices down. \n\n  Each barrel added to the market shrinks the already tight cushion of spare capacity, a vital issue in a market beset with geopolitical concerns spanning from Venezuela to Nigeria to Iran and Iraq. \n\n  The Middle East Economic Survey newsletter reported Friday that the Saudis are considering a boost in oil output to 10 million barrels a day, which would be a jump of nearly 6% from current output around 9.45 million barrels a day currently. The recent peak for Saudi output was around 9.6 million barrels a day in the summer of 2005. \n\n  If past Saudi moves play out again, the output hike will be well underway by the Jeddah talks and presented as a fait accompli in the face of sky-high prices which the kingdom  worries may damage the global economy, particularly poorer nations, and spur investment in alternative energy to the detriment of oil demand. \n\n  The drive to higher output likely hinges on the Khursaniyah oil field, which had been expected to be on-line at end of last year. Saudi Arabia plans for some 500,000 barrels a day of new light crude to come on line soon from the field, providing relief from cutbacks in similar high-quality crude from unrest in Nigeria. \n\n \n   Duration Of Rise Crucial \n \n\n  Crucial to the success of the move will be the duration of the Saudi rise, which will likely be presented as an open-ended commitment until prices come down. \n\n  In January and again in May, when prices were at below $100 and near $125 a barrel, respectively, the Saudis rejected direct calls from U.S. President George W. Bush for an output increase, but did announce a 300,000 barrels a day rise from June 1 to meet rising customer demand in the U.S. \n\n  U.S. crude oil stocks posted their biggest-ever decline in May on government records dating to the 1950 as refiners are reluctant to hold pricey inventories amid poor refining margins and an uncertain, but sluggish demand outlook. Global stocks are relatively steady, but supplies are a major worry as OPEC, until now, has clamped down on the taps and supplies from non-OPEC producers have lagged expectations. \n\n  The Saudis and OPEC have said the supply/demand scenario doesn't justify prices at current levels and have blamed market speculators for the run up in prices. \n\n  The Jeddah meeting, which is expected to include representatives from large merchant banks who have been issuing forecasts for still higher oil prices of $150 a barrel and beyond, is likely to include an OPEC call for more regulation on oil futures trading. Moves are already underway in the U.S., where OPEC is well aware, too, that legislation has been introduced seeking duck sovereignty issues and allow OPEC members to be sued on anti-trust and price fixing charges. \n\n  OPEC's monthly report on Friday issued some concern that the already increased Saudi output for June may go straight into inventories, rather than being consumed. Bloated inventories, in a typical market, would push down prices. \n\n \n   Spare Capacity Shrinkage \n \n\n  The 300,000 barrels a day Saudi rise from June 1 \"should lead to a higher than normal stockbuild in the third quarter and a contra-seasonal increase in the fourth,\" OPEC said. \"This clearly demonstrates that the market is amply supplied and that claims that the recent surge in prices is due to a supply shortage are unjustified.\" \n\n  Pushing Saudi output to 10 million barrels a day would reduce OPEC's current effective spare capacity to less than 1.2 million barrels a day, using latest figures from the International Energy Agency. \n\n  In 2004, when Saudi Arabia last announced a unilateral rise in output to push down rising prices, the increase was overwhelmed by surging Chinese demand. The market instead focused on OPEC's razor thin capacity and prices rose, instead of falling. \n\n  Back then, the Saudis were happy when prices held around $30 a barrel, which they considered a \"fair\" price. The kingdom won't say what the right price is now, only that it shouldn't hurt the global economy or demand for oil and provide fair returns, including in high cost production regions. \n\n  It's a safe bet, though, that with Saudi eyes on 10 million barrels a day output, they're looking for a price fall of about that order of magnitude - $30. \n\n \n   \n-By David Bird, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4423; david.bird@dowjones.com \n\n  (David Bird is senior energy correspondent for Dow Jones Newswires). \n\n  TALK BACK: We invite readers to send us comments on this or other financial news topics.

However, the monetary authority surprised the markets with a half-point hike Tuesday evening. The key TPM rate now stands at 6.75%. \n\n  The 40-share blue-chip Ipsa index ended at 3,000.58, down 0.6% from Tuesday's close, although it had partly recovered from a 1.5% tumble early in the session. Volume fell to 74.7 billion pesos ($152.6 million) from CLP97.6 billion in the previous session. \n\n  An auction of a 0.64% stake in Banco de Chile (BCH) accounted for $40 million of the day's volume. Banco de Chile ended 0.4% lower at CLP39.35. \n\n  Banks and retailers were hard hit by the rate hike as loans and consumer spending will likely taper off, analysts said. Banco Santander Chile (SAN) tumbled 2.7% to close at CLP21.21, while department store retailer La Polar (LAPOLAR.SN) slid 2.9% to CLP2,410.00. \n\n  Alternative fuel company Schwager (SCHWAGER.SN) was one of the few gainers in the session, jumping 19.4% to close at CLP6.84 on news that it signed a $70 million deal to produce biofuels for the Ventanas division of state copper giant Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile, or Codelco. \n\n  Local stocks will likely track those on Wall street, analysts said, because concerns about U.S. markets are weighing on investors' minds. \n\n  In the local bond market, yields on the Chilean central bank bonds ended higher in reaction to the monetary authority's rate hike, traders said. \n\n  On the official interbank market, the yield on inflation-indexed five-year BCUs ended at 2.91%, up from 2.83% Tuesday, while the yield on 10-year BCUs closed at 3.42%, up from 3.37%. \n\n  The peso, meanwhile, ended 1% weaker against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, falling to a 23-week low, despite the central bank's 50-basis-point rate hike. \n\n  The currency opened stronger against the dollar, near CLP480.00, after the central bank's move. The higher Chilean rates widened the spread between local and U.S. rates, fueling dollar inflows as investors search for better returns. But the currency then gave up  its early gains, losing ground as foreign banks and private pension fund managers began making large dollar purchases on the local market, traders said. \n\n  The peso ended the session at CLP489.70 to the dollar, compared with CLP484.60 at Tuesday's close, after trading in a range of CLP480.25-CLP491.50. \n\n \n\n  -By Carolina Pica, Dow Jones Newswires; 56-2-820-4244; carolina.pica@dowjones.com \n\n  (Patricia San Juan contributed to this report.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 11, 2008 17:06 ET (21:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253723Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-02T19:17:34.222264Z", "inner_id": 329, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5698, "annotations": [{"id": 5992, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "n5smhx-I7J", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T14:17:02.136169Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:17:02.136204Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 76.208, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "49f02e39-914e-4181-a8dc-51352e68273b", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5698, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "ADB Exec Calls For Tighter Monetary Policies In Asia\n\n \n\n  KUALA LUMPUR (AP)--Asia's growth is being threatened by spiraling inflation due to higher food and fuel cost, an Asian Development Bank executive warned Sunday, as he called on governments to tighten monetary policies to deal with the scourge. \n\n  The bank is reviewing its growth forecast of 7.6% this year for Asia, excluding Japan, amid concerns inflation will widen income inequality in the region and cause more people to plunge into poverty, said its managing director general Rajat M.Nag. \n\n  Asia's growth last year hit a two-decade high of 8.7%. At the same time, the ADB in April forecast inflation to hit 5.1% this year, the highest in a decade. But this forecast may also go up, Nag told The Associated Press. \n\n  Among the worst hit is Vietnam, where inflation is currently more than 25%. Singapore, Thailand, India, Philippines and Indonesia are looking at inflation rates of between 7.5% and 11%. \n\n  \"The growth story is in danger because there are inflationary dark clouds in the horizon, which we have to recognize as the greatest concern,\" Nag said on the sidelines of a two-day global economic forum here. \n\n  \"We feel that monetary policies have to be tightened so that inflationary expectations are tamed,\" he said. Among the measures he suggested were raising interest rates, increasing banks' reserve requirement and ensuring a flexible exchange rate. Some central banks have already reaised borrowing rates in the past two months. \n\n  Surging food prices, stoked by rising fuel costs that have increased production and transport costs, have triggered protests around the world in recent months. Riots have erupted over food shortages in the Caribbean and Africa and hunger is approaching crisis stage in parts of Asia. \n\n  A number of Asian nations such as India, Malaysia and Indonesia recently cut fuel subsidies amid rising world oil prices, which is expected to further send inflation soaring. \n\n  \"Inflation is the most regressive form of taxation and it hits the poor most. In Asia, roughly about a billion people are vulnerable to the food and fuel price increases,\" he said. \n\n  Nag defended the governments for reducing the unaffordable subsidies. But governments must ensure \"targeted cash support\" for the poor to protect them from the price hikes, he said. \n\n  Asia, which is home to two-thirds of the world's poor, successfully cut its poverty rate to about 19% currently, from 33% in 1990, but this is under threat due to inflation, he said. \n\n  Some 600 million people in the region survive on a dollar a day or less, and about 400 million people who live on just above a dollar, making up the most vulnerable group to the price increases. \n\n  The Manila-based development lending institution last month announced $500 million in emergency aid for poor countries struggling with soaring food prices. It will also double its lending for the agricultural sector in 2009 to $2 billion. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 15, 2008 00:37 ET (04:37 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253753Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:17:02.365771Z", "inner_id": 330, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5699, "annotations": [{"id": 5994, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "1dZVwO1Cpy", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T14:17:20.224271Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:17:20.224296Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 17.106, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "7f4be982-0dfa-451f-8d15-b551c26a45d8", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5699, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "WSJA(6/5) India And Malaysia Trim Fuel Subsidies\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) \n   By Jackie Range in New Delhi and Elffie Chew in Kuala Lumpur \n\n  Amid record crude-oil prices, India and Malaysia announced increases in fuel prices Wednesday, risking higher inflation rates and a backlash from consumers to relieve mounting pressure from subsidies on national finances. \n\n  The countries are the latest Asian nations to trim subsidies that have long cushioned consumers -- including manufacturers and other businesses -- from rising energy costs. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan have substantially increased state-regulated fuel prices, as well. \n\n  India raised the retail prices of gasoline and diesel by about 10% to trim growing losses at state-run oil marketing companies that sell fuel at subsidized rates. Lifting prices for the second time this year, the government will add three rupees (seven U.S. cents) to the price of a liter of diesel and five rupees to a liter of gasoline, effective Thursday. New Delhi also scrapped a 5% import tax on crude oil and cut the import tax on gasoline and diesel to 2.5% from 7.5%. \n\n  In oil- and gas-producing Malaysia, the government made a much bigger 41% increase in heavily subsidized gasoline prices, and said it would also boost diesel prices and electricity rates. Kuala Lumpur said it plans to start using global market rates for pricing fuel to avert an ever-growing subsidy burden on the country's budget. \n\n  The decisions to pass along higher fuel costs to consumers were taken despite the threat of higher inflation and possible political unrest in both India and Malaysia. \n\n  In India, Asia's second fastest-growing major economy, the fuel price increases could further weaken the ruling Congress Party-led coalition government's prospects in a general election that must be held by May in which it is expected to lose ground. The government is already grappling with the political fallout of higher inflation -- now at its highest level since September 2004. \n\n  In the week ended May 17, India's wholesale price index rose 8.1% from a year earlier. Mumbai-based ratings agency Crisil, predicts the fuel-price increase will push up wholesale price inflation by 0.95 percentage point. But Crisil economist Dharmakirti Joshi doesn't expect the increase to hamper economic growth and is sticking to his forecast that India's gross domestic product will expand 8.1% in the fiscal year ending March 31. \n\n  Still, higher fuel prices and inflation are likely to turn up the pressure on the Congress Party. Rising inflation was cited as a key reason for its recent failure in elections in the southern state of Karnataka, which followed defeats in contests in several other states. \n\n  Communist allies of the Congress Party threatened to block roads and rail traffic beginning Thursday to protest the fuel-price increase. The leftist parties, whose support is necessary for India's coalition government to stay in power, want a review of the price decision. But Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murli Deora told a briefing Wednesday \"the government has no other option but to raise prices.\" \n\n  The price increases are intended to help state-run fuel retailers trim mounting losses. The rise will save India's three state-run retailers -- Indian Oil Corp., Hindustan Petroleum Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. -- about $5 billion through increased revenue this fiscal year, Petroleum Secretary M.S. Srinivasan said. However, the companies are expected to continue to lose money. \n\n  Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya calculates that the fuel-price increase and other measures will reduce India's combined central and state governments' fiscal deficit to about 8.9% of GDP in the current fiscal year from his earlier estimate of 9.3%. Mr. Ahya's estimates include budgeted central and state government spending, along with other items not officially included in their budgets -- such as a recent huge loan waiver for small-scale farmers. In the last fiscal year, which ended March 31, India's official fiscal deficit, by government calculations, was equal to 3.1% of GDP. This fiscal year, the government aims to cut that to 2.5%. \n\n  In Malaysia, fuel price increases will lift the cost of gasoline to 2.70 ringgit, or about 84 U.S. cents, a liter from 1.92 ringgit, while diesel will increase 63% to 2.58 ringgit a liter. Prices will then be reviewed on a monthly basis, officials said. To cushion the impact of the increases, the government will give owners of small and medium-size cars a yearly 625 ringgit rebate, enough to cover the price increase for up to 800 liters. \n\n  Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whose ruling Barisan Nasional coalition had its worst election performance in nearly four decades in March, dismissed suggestions the latest price rises could make the government more unpopular. \"It has to be done. It's not an attempt to be popular. We can't satisfy everyone,\" he told reporters. \n\n  Subsidies in Malaysia, introduced in 1983, have kept its fuel prices among the lowest in Southeast Asia. But the surge in global oil prices has made the subsidies too onerous for the government. Had Wednesday's price increases not been introduced, Malaysia's fuel-subsidy bill would have reached around 50 billion ringgit this year, or about one-third of government budget expenditures. With the price increase, the government expects to save 13.7 billion ringgit, part of which will be used to help subsidize rising food prices. \n\n  --- \n\n  Vibhuti Agarwal and Krishna Pokharel in New Delhi contributed to this article. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 04, 2008 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.253787Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:17:20.439877Z", "inner_id": 331, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5700, "annotations": [{"id": 5995, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "icI0zrGEyx", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T14:18:05.581465Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:18:05.581490Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 44.304, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "59f4734b-f798-4aa6-9c90-ce9d7fceef94", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5700, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "PREVIEW:Reliance Indus,ONGC 1Q Net Seen Up On High Oil Prices\n\n \n\n  By Romit Guha \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  TAKING THE PULSE: High crude oil prices are likely to boost the earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd.

In nearby coastal hamlets, some clusters of homes are half-built, with wires dangling from garage ceilings and pipes sticking out of the ground. \n\n  While just about every bank in town is suffering as a result, Bradenton's latest crop of start-up banks has been hammered. At First Priority Bank, which opened in 2003, nonperforming assets have swelled to 16% of total assets, according to analysts. Coast Financial Holdings Inc., staggered by bad loans to out-of-state investors who hoped to flip homes, nearly failed before being sold to First Banks Inc. of St. Louis last year. \n\n  \"They went hog-wild and made far too many of these loans,\" said Tramm Hudson, a local banker who advised Coast before it was sold. \n\n  More than 630 banks were launched from 2003 to 2007, according to SNL Financial LC, a Charlottesville, Va., research firm, raising more than $8.9 billion in capital. \n\n  But investors who poured money into fledgling banks, which usually rely heavily on commercial loans, are being pounded by the erosion in credit quality. \n\n  Many of the new banks now face an uphill battle to become profitable beyond the initial losses typical for upstart banks. Some institutions could be forced to put themselves on the block, but buyers are scarce, partly because of suspicions that many banks aren't being honest enough about the problems lurking in their books. \n\n  The worst performers may have to fight for their lives, though there have been no failures among banks in the latest bumper crop of start-ups. \n\n  \"Right now, the outlook is very challenging, and it will most likely get worse,\" said Christopher Marinac, research director of FIG Partners LLC, a research firm in Atlanta. \n\n  The troubles afflicting many of the banks that sprouted when times were good don't pose a major threat to the banking industry because the fledgling banks generally are tiny compared with regional and nationwide lenders. But their stumbles show how far excessive exuberance spread among bankers usually known for conservatism. \n\n  Many of the shakiest new banks were launched in red-hot real-estate markets that now are reeling from the housing slump. \n\n  In Florida, about 2.2% of loans at banks started from 2003 to 2006 were considered problem loans at the end of this year's first quarter, according to SNL, meaning that a borrower has stopped paying interest and principal. The definition also can include repossessed property or loans identified as troubled for other reasons. \n\n  In the Atlanta area, problem loans amounted to 2.9% of overall loans at start-up banks. Banks and thrifts established outside those two areas during the same period averaged 1.1%. \n\n  Bradenton and the surrounding area of about 687,000 residents, roughly between Tampa and Sarasota, was a center of real-estate speculation. Three new banks formed in Bradenton since 2000 saw the activity as an opportunity for fast growth. Home prices surged 35% in 2005, and bankers eagerly made loans to finance houses, strip malls and condominiums. When the housing market stalled, defaults ballooned. \n\n  Loan officers at Community Bank of Manatee said they knew something was seriously awry when borrowers would come in and start to cry. \"These were grown men,\" said Bill Sedgeman, the bank's chairman and founder. \"They'd get very emotional.\" \n\n  Mr. Sedgeman's bank was founded in 1995 and avoided much of the construction lending that hurt its local rivals, he said. \n\n  Still, Community Bank of Manatee was pinched because it hasn't matched the deposit rates paid by struggling banks trying to keep customers from defecting. \"People wanted us to match, but we need a spread to stay in business,\" he said. \n\n  Coast, started in 2000, sank more than $100 million -- or one-fourth of its loan portfolio -- into loans related to homes being built by Construction Compliance Inc., based in St. Petersburg, Fla. That exposure was far too big for the bank's size, analysts say. When the real-estate market plummeted, borrowers stopped payments on loans that were underwater. The builder halted construction, leaving cinder-block foundations and empty lots dotting towns south of Sarasota. \n\n  Five-year-old First Priority Bank reported $39.3 million in problem loans at the end of the first quarter. The bank has installed a new CEO in an effort to strengthen its financial condition. \n\n  A spokesman said the bank won't rule out selling itself. \"First Priority will explore any opportunity that comes to it regarding ways to solve [its] issues,\" spokesman Frank Knautz said. \n\n  Also clobbered has been Freedom Bank, which opened in Bradenton in 2005. \n\n  It posted first-quarter losses of $7.8 million, and nonperforming assets have climbed to more than 8% of its total, according to analysts. \n\n  \"In looking back . . . loans were being made mostly in the commercial real-estate arena and the development arena, and when that bubble burst, we all had to live with that,\" said David Zuern, who was brought in as CEO in April. \n\n  To turn the bank around, Mr. Zuern is trying to raise capital and shore up the bank's core deposits. \n\n  Some analysts say struggling new banks in cities like Bradenton still might turn out to be solid investments if they can weather the current woes. \n\n  Once the banking industry stabilizes, \"bigger banks outside of the area are going to be looking to, basically, find a bargain,\" predicted Karen Dorway, president and director of research for BauerFinancial Inc., a bank-rating and research firm in Coral Gables, Fla. \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=SiSYx5wL2CSRXALY47HWLw%3D%3D.

He added that in view of this, it was vital to abandon inflation-indexed wage setting schemes. \n\n  In the German government bond market, the bund yield curve inverted further Wednesday after ECB President Trichet warned of the risk of prolonged high inflation in the euro-zone economy. \n\n  The comments weighed on the front end of the yield curve, which currently prices in an accommodative ECB stance, BNP Paribas' brokerage said. \n\n  Trichet said risks to consumer price inflation would \"prevail\" at present and that the rise in the consumer price index is likely to moderate only gradually next year. \n\n  June inflation accelerated to 4%, according to the Eurostat flash-estimate, and is unlikely to fall back below 3% during the remainder of the year due to surging oil prices. \n\n  Trichet said such inflation levels were \"worrying.\" \n\n  The ECB raised its key interest rate to 4.25% from 4% Thursday, after keeping it steady since June 2007 despite global market turmoil. \n\n  \"This action underlines the Governing Council's strong determination to prevent second-round effects and maintain longer-term inflation expectations (are) firmly anchored,\" Trichet said. \n\n  The ECB fears that rising commodity and oil prices could prompt people to anticipate further gains in inflation, thereby triggering a wage-price spiral. \n\n  Companies, ranging from producers of intermediate goods to consumer product and car makers, said recently they will raise their prices, due to high oil, energy and steel prices. \n\n  In turn, some labor unions are likely to increase their pay claims, arguing that high inflation is reducing workers' purchasing power. \n\n  Trichet said the central bank's rate hike was \"the contribution of the ECB's monetary policy to preserving purchasing power over the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area.\" \n\n  Some E.U. parliamentarians criticized Trichet for not mentioning the negative effects that a higher ECB interest rate will have on economic growth in his speech as the hike curtails access to credit for both firms and households. \n\n  The chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker, however, defended the ECB's monetary policy, arguing the central bank was acting in accordance with its mandate to preserve price stability. \n\n \n   ECB Web site: www.ecb.int \n \n\n  -By Roman Kessler, Dow Jones Newswires, +4969 2972 5514, roman.kessler@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=%2FQa2nu6jewX%2BxOyI7SEPCw%3D%3D.

Wen had acknowledged in March that the CPI target would be hard to meet. \n\n  The CPI in January-May rose 8.1% from the same period last year, exceeding the 4.8% gain last year. \n\n  Wen's comments and remarks by other senior officials over the weekend suggest Beijing is unlikely to ease efforts to add more value to China-made export goods, boost domestic consumption and develop its service industries, despite concerns that a U.S. economic slowdown and surging global prices of oil and commodities will hurt Chinese companies. \n\n  \"We need to accelerate the mode of growth in external trade, improve the structure of imports and exports, and raise the core competitiveness of exports in the market,\" a statement on the central government's Web site cited Wen as saying. Wen was visiting both areas from Friday to Sunday, to learn about the economic situation there. \n\n  In the past two years, Beijing has cut rebates on export taxes for thousands of products, particularly those whose manufacture requires a lot of energy and emits a lot of pollution. It has restricted exports in the processing trade - where firms import raw materials to make products for duty-free exports. And it has allowed the yuan to rise, encouraging domestic consumption but hurting exports. \n\n  Echoing the call for a restructuring of Chinese exports, Vice Premier Wang Qishan was reported by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying: \"The model of crude external-trade growth of the past is hard to sustain. We need to ... boost the efficiency of companies and their competitiveness.\" \n\n  Both men encouraged the development of China's service industry, particularly the financial sector. \n\n  Wen reiterated China's goal of making Shanghai a global financial hub, and said the city should aim to become a shipping hub for northeast Asia. \n\n  Xinhua cited Wang, responsible for the financial sector, as saying China needs to boost its financial services. \n\n  \"Preventing risks is the financial sector's eternal main task,\" he said during a visit to the eastern province of Shandong from Thursday to Friday. He urged financial firms to \"pay close attention to all kinds of possible risks and maintain financial security and stability.\" \n\n \n\n  -By Terence Poon; Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588 5848; terence.poon@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=zWzWhyv77fAzXNFP%2BpXClA%3D%3D.

Panera's no exception. Its upscale baker-cafe chains appeal to customers ranging from moms meeting for a soup and salad lunch to business folk grabbing a Chicken Bacon Dijon panini while tapping away on their laptops. It's a slightly pricier option than fast-food chains like McDonald's, but more upscale, too, playing on ambiance as much as its fresh bakery appeal. \n\n  Perhaps because of this, Panera has been able to pull off a price rise. It has focused on maximizing profit, wooing customers to higher-margin items, while being smarter about costs like wheat purchases. But the stock's now looking well-baked, particularly as customer traffic is straining. \n\n  \"In the past we had been focused on the dollars consumers brought into the cafe,\" Panera Chief Executive Ronald Shaich said in a recent earnings call. \"But for the last nine months and going forward, we have been and will be focused on the dollars consumers leave when they walk out of the cafe.\" \n\n  Last month, Panera's second-quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. It even raised its profit goals for the year. Its stock now trades around $53, up more than 40% since the start of the year when it was wallowing at a five-year low. But that makes it pricey, trading on about 23-times forward earnings, though rival Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) is an even loftier 28-times. \n\n  Sure, price increases have helped keep sales growth positive, but the latest indications show traffic declined in July, meaning the company is losing customers compared with last year. \n\n  Panera says the dip in traffic is a result of a \"stew\" of other elements, including tough year-ago comparisons. In fact, Shaich said in a recent earnings call that internal surveys have found that consumers still think of Panera, with its focaccia sandwiches, strawberry poppyseed salads and soups in a bread bowl, as a value. And traffic remained up during price increases earlier this year. \n\n  But even if consumers snub $7 salads, Panera has taken some proactive measures to help keep profits intact. \n\n  The Richmond Heights, Mo., company refers to these changes as a \"paradigm evolution,\" which came after the chain lost its way in 2007. Following several years of impressive growth and a five-year period in which it more than doubled the number of stores, Panera posted a same-store-sales gain, a closely followed metric, of just 1.7% for fiscal 2007. \n\n  Panera executives acknowledge taking their eyes off the ball. The company focused on blindly bringing more people to their stores, never mind if they wound up buying lower-margin items. A pizza product called Crispiani floundered. As wheat and oil prices ticked up, sales margins contracted. \n\n  \"They had decelerating margins but nobody cared because they kept generating enough top-line growth,\" Steve West, restaurant analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said. \n\n  Panera followed with a redesign of its menu boards to draw the customer's eyes toward meals with higher margins, like the soup-and-salad combo, rather than pricier items that may not bring as much to the bottom line. It also ditched the pizza product and started pricing its specialty bagels like ones infused with asiago cheese or baked with apples, cinnamon and raisins at $1.25, while plain and everything bagels were 99 cents. \n\n  \"The careful testing and restructuring of the menu board and menu engineering made it easier for people to order higher gross margin items,\" said Bryan Elliot, analyst at Raymond James & Associates. \n\n  Panera also started to make its wheat purchases at least six months out, as a way to stave off cost volatility due to hyperinflation that has driven costs to $15 a bushel for the current quarter compared with $5.80 a bushel in the prior-year period. \n\n  The moves helped improve operating margins in the most recent quarter by about 2.7% at company-owned stores in the face of higher ingredient costs. \n\n  On another flank, Panera hopes to drive more sales during the morning with grilled breakfast sandwiches and is testing combo meals during that time as well. \n\n  Even as macro pressures weigh on the restaurant space, Panera is viewed among the leaders in the hottest sub-sector among dining chains: fast casual. Alongside other category leader Chipotle, fast-casual chains fall in the middle between fast-food and sit-down restaurants, offering high-quality food with fast service. Such chains are seeing increased traffic as diners \"trade-down\" from casual-dining chains and \"trade-up\" from fast-food restaurants, according to restaurant consultant Technomic Inc. \n\n  That has caused other restaurant chains to encroach on the space. Subway, for one, has recently started testing an upscale design in the Washington, D.C., market. \n\n  Panera also has an ideal target audience. Many locations are situated near office environments, targeting workers for their breakfast and lunch options, and other high-income suburban areas. \n\n  But that doesn't mean that Panera customers won't be immune entirely to the economic pinch, which is why company executives are tempering their growth expectations for next year as inflation, commodity costs and a shaky consumer take a toll. \n\n  \"The end of the current hyper-inflationary environment and broader economic recession do not appear to be near hand,\" Panera Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Kip said recently. \n\n  (Paul Ziobro covers the restaurant industry for Dow Jones Newswires.) \n\n  -By Paul Ziobro, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2046; paul.ziobro@dowjones.com \n\n  TALK BACK: We invite readers to send us comments on this or other financial news topics.

But the drop may not be fast or strong enough to offset an economic slowdown and the government's plans to spend down its budget surplus ahead of an election next year. \n\n  \"Only half the price increases are attributable to external factors beyond the control of Bulgarian authorities,\" said UniCredit economist Fabio Mucci. \n\n  Private-sector credit is booming at a 52% annual rate, wages are rising 25% a year and government expenditure on fuel and other subsidies have shot up more than 50% in the past year. Meanwhile, industrial production is slowing, as is demand in Bulgaria's European export markets. \n\n  Normally, higher central bank rates would be deployed to control an overheating economy. Romania, where inflation slowed to 8% in August, has a policy rate of 10.25%. But Bulgaria has a currency board that links its currency, the lev, to the euro and strips it of control over interest rates. \n\n  The central bank hasn't used its other policy tools, such as raising reserve requirements to curtail lending. Meanwhile, fiscal policy has been tight but will now be loosened as the government plans to offer new benefits such as free vacations and heating fuel subsidies for families. \n\n  Authorities seem to hope declining commodity prices will tame inflation, but it's more likely that will only happen as the economy slows over the next few years, said Mucci. \n\n  Food prices have declined for four months in a row, and their annual rate of growth in August was only 9.4% on the month, below the headline inflation rate and sharply down from the 24% jump on the year reported as recently as June, according to data from the statistics institute. \n\n  However, the planned stimulus may lift inflation more than growth, according to Mitko Dimitrov, an economist at the Bulgarian Academy of Science. Hasty short-term handouts are an inefficient use of the budget surplus because their likely aim is to boost current private spending, he said. \n\n  Cutting income, payroll and corporate taxes would be more effective because it would free resources to be used more productively, said Dimitar Chobanov, an analyst at the Institute of Market Economics in Sofia. \n\n  Lower oil prices may not offer much solace for Bulgaria, where Bulgargaz, the gas monopoly, this week asked for regulatory approval of 37% price hikes starting next month. The company claims local heating companies are failing to pay their bills, leaving it strapped for cash to import wholesale gas from Russia and build out its network. \n\n  Bulgargaz subsidies have put its financial stability at risk and cannot go on forever, which means that \"opportunities to cushion the impact of higher international gas prices on the local economy are decreasing,\" said UniCredit's Mucci. \n\n  Meanwhile, Bulgaria's main growth driver, construction and real estate, is showing signs of stalling. Foreign direct investment in the sector is in decline, which raises doubts about how the country can sustain a current-account deficit of more than 20% of gross domestic product. \n\n  There's a risk Bulgaria may lose its triple-B rating from Standard & Poor's, according to UniCredit. \n\n  Those doubts are increasingly evident in financial markets. The Sofix blue-chip index has lost more than 40% this year and is trading at two-year lows. \n\n  The cost of insuring Bulgarian sovereign debt against default for five years was 222 basis points on Thursday, according to data provider Markit. That's 47 basis points wider than a month ago and a whopping 190 basis points wider than a year ago. \n\n  \"There is a danger of an economic hard landing in Bulgaria,\" said Calyon strategist Simon Smollett, who expects growth to slow to 4.7% in 2009 from 6.6% this year. \n\n  The currency board will probably be kept, but it currently isn't helping, he and others noted. \n\n  With a euro peg, any decrease in capital inflows will automatically lead to the contraction of the local currency in circulation and trigger an abrupt economic crunch, according to Goldman Sachs, which noted that several Baltic states are now flirting with recession after double-digit GDP growth only a year ago. \n\n  The competitiveness of Bulgaria's lev \"requires a period of inflation below euro-zone inflation levels, which seems unlikely given the government's reluctance to squeeze the economy by increasing the budget surplus,\" Smollett said. \n\n  -By Christopher Emsden, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-02-58-21-99-05; chris.emsden@dowjones.com \n\n  (Clare Connaghan in London contributed to this report.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 12, 2008 10:07 ET (14:07 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.254148Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:36:57.362733Z", "inner_id": 342, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5711, "annotations": [{"id": 6016, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "VFUGFT9zH3", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T14:41:08.528042Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:41:08.528076Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 250.439, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "ecc34b5a-3aef-483c-a497-defbf275c8c4", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5711, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "MARKET TALK:EUR/USD To Stay Bid As Mkts Digest US Rescue Plan\n\n \nContact us in Singapore. 65 64154 140; \nMarketTalk@dowjones.com \n \n \n\n  2026 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/USD likely to trade with a bid-bias in Asia today as investors continue to digest U.S. rescue plan aimed at easing crisis in U.S. financial markets, says trader at Deutsche Bank in NZ; \"high yielders will benefit as the markets continue to get details of the rescue plan and people start to feel that things may calm down somewhat this week.\" Adds that upside will be contained as \"everyone knows that there's no silver bullet to the problems in the U.S.\" EUR/USD last 1.4499, rose to 1.4502 in early NZ trade - highest level since Sept. 4.

Mitsubishi will increase prices by 2.9%, on average, for three commercial vehicles that Mazda produces for the company. \n\n  Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. have also raised prices.

However, they had been cautious that Japanese customers wouldn't easily accept price increases as Japanese companies usually raises domestic prices only when they redesign existing models. \n\n  They are also concerned that price increases could further reduce consumer appetite in the domestic market, where auto sales will likely fall to the lowest level in decades this year. \n\n  However, Mazda's price increases will likely do little to help its bottom line, as annual sales of those models account for just 2% of its global auto sales.

And the slowing of the U.S. and global economies over the past several months has brought negative effects on prices that have been felt across commodities markets. \n\n  Outside commodities markets have to some degree become more of a focus than weather of trader attention, with traders watching what is happening in crude oil and the U.S. dollar before checking the weather, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co. \n\n  Weather is a key factor in the development of crops and is usually the primary influence during the summer growing season. \n\n  Corn and soybeans have a correlation with crude oil because of the alternative fuels ethanol and biodiesel, and that relationship makes energy an influence for corn and soy on a daily basis, traders said. In the U.S., ethanol is made primarily from corn while biodiesel is typically made from soyoil, which is produced when soybeans are crushed. \n\n  The slowing U.S and world economies have raised concerns about future export demand, as high prices spark fears of global curbed food demand, Basse said. \n\n  The grain market continues to look for a strong fundamental clue that will allow corn and soybeans to stand on their own feet, with a reduction in yield and production forecasts the latest feature to try to rescue the market from a recent downturn. \n\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's cut to yields and lowering of production on Friday should give grain and oilseed markets a lift, especially after recent losses, which have been seen across commodities markets. A rallying U.S. dollar and the exodus of index and hedge funds recently have pushed prices down sharply from all-time highs scored in 2008. \n\n  Futures did settle higher Friday, in part due to the report. Chicago Board of Trade December corn futures settled up the 30-cent, exchange-imposed trading limit at $5.63 1/4 a bushel. November soybeans settled 26 cents higher at $12.02 a bushel. \n\n  David Hightower, principal and founder of Hightower Report, said the sharp break in grain prices is directly related to the influence of outside markets, rather than prices falling because yields were expected to rise. \n\n  \"Because of the macroeconomic influences, this data won't be as powerfully bullish as it could be,\" Hightower said. \"But if the stock market stabilizes and crude oil bottoms, we could see inflation concerns coming back.\" \n\n  The market is in a corrective phase from overbought conditions experienced during corn and soybeans' historic run to all-time highs. Simple rationing of supplies have emerged, as once prices got too high, end-users adjusted their buying habits, and the world seemingly is using fewer commodities and producing nations are searching for demand, analysts said. \n\n  The market is readjusting downward, making it difficult for buyers to fight against a general bearish trend. \n\n  \"Commodities are cyclical, and we are in a bearish cyclical phase in the market, making it easy to sell-off on bearish news, particularly from outside-market factors,\" said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential Bache Commodities in New York. \n\n  The U.S. has a very tight domestic supply situation, but the \"U.S. is a bullish island in a bearish sea,\" as global inventories are not scarce, Frick said. \n\n  The world oilseed market has intrinsic bearish factors, with increased world rapeseed and sunseed production, larger Chinese soy crop prospects and India's soy crop seen up this year, Frick said. \n\n  The fall of the U.S. dollar over the past few years fueled the commodity boom. And amid the global economic woes, the soybean market seemingly overshot on the high side. That and a recently stronger dollar have opened the door for the current downside correction, analysts said. \n\n  However, an extremely tight soybean stock situation, with very few supplies in the hands of end-users, will continue to lend support, particularly with uncertainty surrounding 2008 yields. \n\n  Further yield reductions from USDA will force fundamentals back into the mainstream of market focus, said Dan Cekander, analyst with Newedge. \n\n  \"If you get U.S. soybean yields down to 39 or 38 bushels an acre, supply would be so tight and fundamentals so bullish, severe supply rationing would be needed and futures could decouple from bearish outside economic factors,\" Cekander added. \n\n \n\n  -By Andrew Johnson Jr., Dow Jones Newswires; 312-347-4604; andrew.johnsonjr@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 15, 2008 07:35 ET (11:35 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.254244Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T14:43:57.132880Z", "inner_id": 345, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5714, "annotations": [{"id": 6028, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "GzFI5GFzZv", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:06:47.322985Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T13:50:25.184742Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 2032.969, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "67a6e5b2-76eb-449c-b8f2-295737b39ca6", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5714, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "MONEY TALKS: UK Economy To Dive With UK Housing\n\n \n   By Alen Mattich \n   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN \n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Something very bad is happening to the U.K. economy. \n\n  Mortgage market data released this morning show that a mere GBP143 million was lent against houses during August. That represents just 5% of mortgage lending made a month earlier. \n\n  August's scale of lending would have represented a rounding error in normal times. To put the number into context, it represents lending on little more than 1,000 properties, based on an average house price of around GBP175,000 and 75% mortgages. \n\n  The scale of the decline might be shocking, but the fact that mortgage lending is falling should surprise no one. Even though house prices have been nose-diving during the past year, they are still far too expensive, both in terms of mortgage service costs and set against household incomes. \n\n  The average fixed rate mortgage was 5.96% in July - the most recent month for which the Council of Mortgage Lenders provides data. Anecdotally, that's gone up since. An average fixed rate mortgage for an averagely priced house with 25% down currently runs at around 6.3%. \n\n  In July 2007 it was 5.71%, and a year before that it was 5.12%. \n\n  At the same time, rising unemployment, rising inflation and static earnings means that even with house prices falling at between 10% and 15% on the year (depending on which index you look at), affordability is going down. \n\n  Buyers are also reluctant to commit to the market because they expect further price falls. To get back to historic price-earnings ratios, U.K. house prices would need to drop another 30% to 40% - never mind overshooting to the downside. \n\n  Prospective buyers often depending on sales of their own houses to raise finance, creating housing chains. These chains have become ever more fragile as participants get cold feet, as their approved mortgages expire, or as they withdraw from sales after buyers suddenly drop their offer prices. Hometrack, a housing research firm, expects this year to be the worst for property market turnover since the 1960s. \n\n  Now, the housing market's problems might not matter for the wider economy - for everyone who loses out from house price falls, there's someone who gains - were it not for the U.K. economy's dependence on debt. U.K. household debt is only just short of 180% of GDP, up from just over 100% during the late 1990s. The current debt level is the highest of any developed country. Ever. \n\n  Mortgage equity withdrawal was a massive driver of growth during the past decade. Without it, the economy will have considerably less oomph. \n\n  What's more, it won't come back. The disaster in the financial markets and the collapse of two big mortgage lenders - Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley - as well as consolidation elsewhere in the industry - Santander's recent acquisition of Alliance & Leicester; Lloyds' takeover of HBOS; and the disappearance of a couple of smaller building societies - suggests considerably less competition between lenders in future. The era of 115% mortgages is dead. Banks will require buyers to put more of their own money into the deal, which will require savings rates to go up. Bigger deposits mean lower house prices, mean lower overall lending. \n\n  Whatever rescues are orchestrated by governments, be they nationalizations like B&B and Northern Rock or massive programs like the U.S.'s $700 billion plan, the fact is that there will be less lending in future. \n\n  Economies, particularly the U.K.'s, will have to adapt. \n\n \n\n  (Alen Mattich is a senior reporter and has been writing a column on market strategy for five years.

The Central Statistics Agency will release official inflation data Monday around 0630 GMT. \n\n  The Islamic fasting month of Ramadan ended last week and millions of people in Muslim-majority Indonesia had traveled extensively within the country and enjoyed lavish feasts to celebrate Idul Fitri or Eid-al-Fitr, the festivity that concludes the Ramadan month. \n\n  But the economists said food price controls and an ample supply of commodities may help keep a lid on festivity-related inflation this year, despite likely higher household fuel consumption coinciding with an increase in prices of kerosene and liquefied natural gas. \n\n  \"Inflation likely stayed elevated largely due to more pronounced passthrough effects from the fuel price hike in May and the hike in retail LPG prices in both early July (by 23.5%) and late August (by 9.5%),\" Citi economist Leon Hiew said. \n\n  Hiew added that \"inflation has peaked (in September) but would remain stubborn in coming off given persistent inflationary momentum from previous months.\" \n\n  The economists said a 20% increase in transport costs in July - after the government hiked gasoline and diesel prices by almost 29% in May - presents an inflation risk especially as transport usage spikes due to Idul Fitri. \n\n \nInstitution        CPI forecast \n                   On-Mo    On-Yr \nMandiri Sekuritas  +0.94%   +12.27% \nLippo Bank         +0.90%   +12.18% \nDanareksa          +0.76%   +12.01% \nIdeaGlobal          n/a     +12.00% \nStanChart          +0.80%   +12.00% \nBank Internasional +0.95%   +11.98% \nCiti                n/a     +11.60% \nBank Danamon       +0.82%   +11.97% \nAction Economics   +0.50%   +11.70% \nJP Morgan          -1.00%   +10.40% \n \nMedian             +0.81%   +11.99% \nAugust CPI         +0.51%   +11.85% \n \n\n  -By Reuben Carder, Dow Jones Newswires; 62 21 3983 1277; Reuben.Carder@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 05, 2008 20:05 ET (00:05 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.254347Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:30:25.806923Z", "inner_id": 348, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5717, "annotations": [{"id": 6055, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "B_yJ5unFTC", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:31:16.060054Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:31:16.060080Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 48.255, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "2065d545-8558-490e-a9ab-de654c451427", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5717, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "DATA SNAP: Vietnam Oct CPI Eases,On-Mo Lowest Since Mar &apos;07\n\n \n\n  HANOI (Dow Jones)--Vietnam's inflation rate eased in October as the cost of fuel, food and construction materials fell from the previous month, indicating that the country's rampant inflation has peaked. \n\n  The consumer price index rose 26.72% from a year earlier in October after rising 27.9% in September, the Government Statistics Office said in a statement released Saturday. \n\n  Vietnam usually issues economic data based on estimates before the end of the reporting period. \n\n  The month-to-month rate of inflation will ease 0.19% in October, marking its smallest increase since March 2007.

And with the target federal funds rate already at 1%, some officials pointed out that the Fed has \"limited room\" to lower further and should therefore move slowly. \n\n  \"Some members were concerned that the effectiveness of cuts in the target federal funds rate may have been diminished by the financial dislocations, suggesting that further policy action might have limited efficacy in promoting a recovery in economic growth,\" said the minutes. \n\n  Additionally, officials suggested that the U.S. economy could be in for a rather lengthy recession and downgraded their economic forecasts. The minutes show that officials generally expect the economy to contract in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. And some officials expect that the economic weakness \"could persist for some time.\" \n\n  Officials made clear in their Oct. 28-29 meeting that \"unfolding economic developments\" could require the Federal Open Market Committee \"to further lower its target for the federal funds rate in the future and to review the adequacy of its liquidity facilities.\" \n\n  Fed officials said they anticipate that economic data would show \"significant weakness in economic activity\" and that additional policy easing could well be necessary, according to the meeting minutes. \n\n  Meanwhile, they said they expect inflation to diminish in coming quarters. \n\n  \"In any event, the committee agreed that it would take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery of the economy,\" the minutes said. \n\n  Overall, officials found that risks to the economy had greatly escalated and the credit crisis had morphed into an \"international phenomenon,\" leaving them little choice but to cut interest rates to four-year lows. \n\n  As the credit crisis worsened last month, the FOMC voted unanimously Oct. 29 to lower the target federal-funds rate at which banks lend to each other by 0.5 percentage point to 1%, its lowest level since the period between June 2003 and June 2004. The decision came in wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s (LEHMQ) September collapse, the near-failure of insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG) and new concerns about the conditions of other financial firms. \n\n  The Fed officials agreed that \"significant easing in policy was warranted at this meeting in view of the marked deterioration in the economic outlook and anticipated reduction in inflation pressures,\" the minutes said. \n\n  They also noted that the credit crisis expanded globally since their September policy meeting, at which they held rates steady. \n\n  \"The strains from the banking and credit crisis intensified and took on a more global aspect over the intermeeting period,\" the minutes said. \"This development and the related erosion of the economic outlook and reduction in inflationary pressures led many central banks to reduce their policy rates, including in the internationally coordinated action announced on Oct. 8.\" That day, Fed officials agreed to an unprecedented joint rate cut with other major central banks including the European Central Bank and Bank of England. \n\n  Meanwhile, the Fed downgraded its 2008 forecasts for gross domestic product and the unemployment rate, according to a quarterly forecast the Fed released Wednesday. \n\n  The central tendency of officials' forecast is for gross domestic product growth this year to stand between 0.0% and 0.3%, which is lower than its June projection of a 1.0% to 1.6% range. \n\n  Meanwhile, they slashed their GDP growth projection for 2009 to a range of -0.2% to 1.1%. In June, they had seen a 2.0% to 2.8% range for 2009. \n\n  Officials also raised their forecasts for the unemployment rate. They now see the unemployment rate between 6.3% and 6.5% in 2008, up from the previous forecast of 5.5% to 5.7%, the Fed said. \n\n  Amid a deteriorating economy, the unemployment rate had already surpassed the Fed's previous forecast. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate in October soared 0.4 percentage point to 6.5%, the highest level since March 1994. \n\n \n\n  -By Maya Jackson Randall, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9255; maya.jackson-randall@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=UTizz9U0BZpMDUM9Mn6yxQ%3D%3D.

R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the Institute of Economic Growth, said. \"Inflation is clearly trending down and we expect it to touch 7% by March end.\" \n\n  The index fell 0.2% to 235.0 from 235.5 a week earlier, primarily due to the lower prices of manufactured products, data issued earlier Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry showed. \n\n  The fuel products index fell 0.9% from a week earlier, dragged by a 4% on-week fall in naphtha prices and a 5% drop in jet-fuel prices. \n\n  The index, which measures producer prices, is used as a proxy for inflation, as the government reports wholesale price data more quickly and comprehensively than consumer price data. \n\n  The Reserve Bank of India has targeted an inflation rate of 7% in the current fiscal year that ends March 2009. \n\n  Since the beginning of October, the central bank has slashed the repurchase rate by 150 basis points to 7.5% and cut the amount of deposits banks have to set aside with it as cash by 350 basis points to 5.5% to boost declining industrial output and slowing growth. \n\n  According to the latest available data, industrial output expanded 4.8% from a year earlier in September, faster than an expansion of 1.4% in August, but economists expect growth to be muted in the coming months as credit dries up. \n\n  \"Sagging growth has really become a concern and the central bank would look to cut rates to stimulate the economy,\" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, Bank of Baroda's chief economist. \n\n  She expects the RBI to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points and cut the reverse repo rate by 100 basis points by the middle of December. \n\n \n   -By Abhrajit Gangopadhyay & Mukesh Jagota; Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-43563301 abhrajit.gangopadhyay@dowjones.com \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 20, 2008 02:29 ET (07:29 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257206Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:42:24.135923Z", "inner_id": 353, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5722, "annotations": [{"id": 6074, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "CJo7fz31It", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:44:06.686917Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:44:06.686952Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-03T15:44:02.161791Z", "lead_time": 101.761, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "862dc62b-5dd6-476b-a28f-618d3ca6ea2e", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5722, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "News Highlights: Top Economic Stories Of The Day\n\n \n=JAPAN ECON DATA GLOOMY; C/A SURPLUS NARROWS \n\n   Data released in Japan on Tuesday painted a gloomy picture of the domestic economy: the current account surplus narrowed for a seventh straight month, worker sentiment worsened, and bank lending rose because firms had trouble raising funds in the markets.

The rate based at 2.1325% on Nov. 12, having peaked at 4.81875% on Oct. 10. \n\n  The one-month Libor rate edged up to 1.90125% from Thursday's 1.90%. And the overnight rate climbed to 1.1625%, up sharply from Wednesday's 0.9875%. There was no fixing for the overnight rate Thursday because of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. \n\n  The three-month BOR/OIS spread, a gauge of stress in the money markets, pushed out to 180.9 basis points from around 176bps Thursday. \n\n  The spread has narrowed from its widest level of 366bps, seen on Oct. 10 when interbank market tensions peaked. \n\n  Elsewhere, expectations of further interest rate reductions by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which meets next week, were reinforced by weaker-than-anticipated retail sales data from the Confederation of British Industry. \n\n  Three-month sterling Libor fixed lower at 3.91% from Thursday's 3.93125%, while the one-month rate dropped to 3.2625% from 3.2875%. \n\n  The three-month rate has fallen to its lowest since Oct. '03, having peaked at 6.3075% on Oct. 1. \n\n  However, overnight sterling Libor edged higher to 3.0125% from Thursday's 3.00% as month-end funding pressures rose, creeping above the BOE's Bank Rate, currently 3.00%. \n\n  According to Sonia rates, the Bank Rate is expected to fall to around 2.00% on Dec. 4 and to decline to 1.50% by the February MPC meeting. \n\n  Euro Libor fixings fell Friday after weaker-than-anticipated inflation data underpinned market expectations of a minimum 50bps rate cut by the ECB next week. \n\n  The key three-month rate fell to 3.85125% from Thursday's fixing of 3.87375%, while the one-month dropped to 3.566625% from 3.58%. Analysts at UniCredit said Thursday's spike higher was due to the \"turn-of-the-year effect\", and should not be read as a worsening of tensions in the interbank market. \n\n  Meanwhile, the overnight rate rose to 2.94375% from Thursday's 2.90375%, but held below the European Central Bank's refinancing rate, currently 3.25%. \n\n  The Eonia market remained split between a 50bps and 75bps rate cut by the ECB on Dec. 4. \n\n  -By Keith Jenkins, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9495; keith.jenkins@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=AhwCpQQ0pWKzJrCNi%2Bzc7w%3D%3D.

Although oil prices averaged $113 a barrel in the third quarter - almost 2.5 times higher than current levels - Rosneft is well prepared for what is now \"a more challenging operating environment of substantially lower prices,\" the company's Chief Executive Sergei Bogdanchikov said. \n\n  Russian oil firms in recent weeks have trimmed billions of dollars in capital expenditure originally earmarked for 2009, but Rosneft remains the sole Russian oil major to stick to its investment plans for next year. \n\n  The downward revisions have resulted in part from the sudden drop in global oil prices, which this month dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in almost two years as a result of weaker demand in Europe, Russia's main export market. \n\n  \"The quality of Rosneft's projects are very high, so it would actually make sense for them to keep investing, even if the oil price stays low,\" said Pavel Kushnir, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Moscow. \n\n  Rosneft is planning to launch its key Vankor field in Eastern Siberia by mid-2009. Production is expected to peak at 25.5 million tons of crude a year, or more than half a million barrels a day. \n\n  Last year, the company borrowed $22 billion to buy key assets from now-bankrupt Yukos, formerly Russia's biggest oil producer. \n\n  Rosneft said that by Sept. 30 its total loans and borrowings stood at $20.8 billion, of which $8.4 billion was short-term debt. \n\n  As the global financial crisis has worsened, the Russian government, which relies heavily on oil export duties for federal budget revenues, has moved to support the industry through the possibility of loans. \n\n  Rosneft said that since the end of the third quarter, it had obtained $4.6 billion in short-term debt - of which $3.8 billion was nominated in rubles - from state-controlled banks. \n\n  Despite almost unchanged production levels, revenue was up 51% on the year to $20.69 billion from $13.74 billion, thanks to higher crude prices for the period. \n\n  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization reached $5.33 billion, up from $4.05 billion, as Rosneft ramped up output of higher-margin petroleum products through both organic growth and acquisitions the previous year. \n\n  Rosneft shares are well off their mid-May highs, hit most recently by a decline in oil prices and a selloff in Russian equities. \n\n  At 1710 GMT, they were trading down 13.6% at $3.4 each in London, around 60% lower since January. \n\n \n\n  Company Web site: www.rosneft.ru \n\n \n\n  -By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Dow Jones Newswires; +7 495 937 8445; jacob.pedersen@dowjones.com \n\n  (Alexander Kolyandr in London contributed to this report) \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=cyyj%2Fj9l%2Faz7taM%2FBIG0ZQ%3D%3D.

Strauss \n\n  Interview with Rob Arnott \n\n  Founder and Chairman, Research Affiliates \n\n \n\n  Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of asset manager Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., is one of the big thinkers in finance today. \n\n  A former editor of the prestigious Financial Analysts Journal, Arnott, 54, has developed expertise in asset allocation, indexing, and pension funds, among other topics. He's a fierce proponent of fundamental indexing -- in which metrics such as aggregate sales and cash flow are used to weight companies in an index, as opposed to market capitalization. \n\n  With the markets in tatters, Barron's turned last week to Arnott, who in a wide-ranging conversation had plenty to say about fundamental indexing and many other subjects. \"This is not a time to shy away from taking risks,\" says Arnott, who maintains that the market's upheaval has created great investment opportunities, including value stocks and convertible bonds. \"The markets are priced right now to reward risk-bearing more than any time in many, many years,\" he says. Hence, he sees Treasuries, which had a relatively strong '08, as the worst place to put money next year. \n\n  While the fundamental index Arnott uses smartly outran the Standard & Poor's 500 from 2000 to 2006, it underperformed the S&P in '07 by three percentage points and is behind in '08, as value stocks got shellacked. Yet Arnott's faith in the approach remains unshaken. To find out why, please read on: \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What are your thoughts on this year's dismal market? \n\n  Arnott: What we've seen is the consequence of reckless indebtedness. Subprime was the tip of the iceberg. I found it interesting that folks in government were dismissive of subprime as being not a terribly important issue as recently as late 2007 and even early this year. There's been this pattern of aggregate indebtedness at the corporate level, at the household level and at the government level. It's dismissive of the need to pay things back. As a result, when things started to go sour on some of this debt, beginning with subprime, the cascading effect was beyond what most people could have anticipated. I was a bear coming into this credit crunch, and I actually was labeled a perma-bear. And yet this contagion effect went a lot further than I would have predicted, and there are very few observers who expected anything this severe. But the seeds of it were sown quite aggressively over the last decade. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: How did all of that fall into place? \n\n  Arnott: The indebtedness of the United States rose from five times [gross domestic product] to eight times GDP in 10 years. That is reckless, but that's what has been going on. That sowed the seeds for what we have seen. The deleveraging that has taken place has cascading effects that can come from a lot of different directions and can afflict a lot of different markets. \n\n  What we saw in September and October was a take-no-prisoners market in which everything outside of Treasuries was savaged. Finally in November, we saw the beginnings of a rationalization where some markets did begin to recover -- but some markets had been hit beyond any rational valuation of the risks associated with those assets. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What should investors be doing differently in the wake of this huge market downturn? \n\n  Arnott: As shown by the collapse of Bernard Madoff's firm, investors should act with due diligence -- that is, they should be more alert to the risks. We have had a cult of equities develop over the last 20 years in which equities were seen more as the low-risk asset, even the risk-fee asset for those who had a long-term orientation, and that is foolishness. If you are bearing risk, you should get paid for it. If you are picking up nickels in front of a steamroller, trying to identify opportunities to add one-tenth of a percent to your return by taking risks that could cost a 100 times that, that doesn't make sense. People need to be more disciplined about that. That includes individuals, corporations, and banks. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: In light of what's happened this year, what's the best way to approach asset allocation? \n\n  Arnott: Almost everybody, retail investors and institutional investors alike, invests with their eyes in the rearview mirror, favoring what has worked best in the past. But there is a very powerful pattern of mean-reversion in the markets. What has done spectacularly well often takes a rest or it takes a bear market to get back to normal. So the notion of looking at markets and asking what has been hit really hard and, as a consequence, may be priced at really attractive levels is alien to most investors. That goes for your readers, and it goes nearly as much for highly sophisticated institutional investors. This temptation to buy what has done well is the single greatest pitfall in investing, and it is the single reason that a disciplined approach to asset allocation can actually work very, very well. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What's an example of a promising area hit hard? \n\n  Arnott: The average convertible-arbitrage hedge fund was down about 50% year-to-date at the end of last week. But that result for a long-short absolute-return, fully hedged strategy makes no sense. The temptation is to get out, which is what a lot of investors are doing. The other way to look at it is that the forced liquidations of these hedge-fund positions create new opportunities, namely convertible debt priced at extraordinarily attractive yields. The same thing holds true for emerging market stocks and bonds, along with TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities]. \n\n  A year ago, folks were probably getting tired of hearing me say there is no low-hanging fruit and that there are no attractively priced markets, both relative to other markets and relative to their own history. I also was saying not to expect double-digit returns and to take risk off the table. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What's your view now? \n\n  Arnott: It's pretty much the opposite; this is the richest environment of low-hanging fruit I've seen in my career. And you would have to go back to 1973, 1974 or even, in some markets, to the Great Depression to find markets priced as attractively as now. This is not a time to be hunkering down in the safety and comfort of the Treasury curve. There are tremendous opportunities right now. It is so tempting in a bear market to focus on the glass being half-empty and on how much has been lost. But the glass being half full side is largely ignored. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What kind of an asset-allocation mix makes sense to you? \n\n  Arnott: First of all, most investors think that putting some money in growth stocks, some money in value stocks and some money in international stocks is a well-diversified portfolio. It's not. Diversification means taking on risk in markets that are uncorrelated and that can go up when other markets go down. So a well-diversified portfolio should look at multiple sources of risk, not just in stocks. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: Where do you see opportunities? \n\n  Arnott: A year from now, investors in convertible bonds are likely to be very pleased with what they [see] in terms of prices and yields. The same holds for emerging-market debt denominated in the local currency, which I prefer to dollar-denominated debt. You get a premium yield for emerging-market debt and an additional premium for investing in the local currency. Tacitly, that's a dollar bet, but I don't see how the dollar can do well on a long-term basis when we have indebtedness that is eight times our national income. Imagine an individual going to a bank and saying, \"I owe eight times my income and I would like to borrow more.\" The reaction would be immediate and drastic: \"Give us your credit cards; we will slice them up.\" But as a nation we still have our credit cards, and we are still using them aggressively. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What other kinds of investments look good to you in terms of asset allocation? \n\n  Arnott: I also like TIPS. How can we get out of this current mess without renewed inflation? A lot of folks are deeply concerned about the risk of deflation. The temptation is to look at history, especially the Great Depression, which was a deflationary depression and which started with very, very low national indebtedness. If you have very little debt and you have a depression, it is likely to be deflationary. If you have very high debt and you have a depression, it is likely to be massively inflationary. The contrast with Germany in the 1920s is noteworthy; they had massive indebtedness and hyperinflation. I'm not suggesting a risk of hyperinflation. But I am suggesting that people are too glib about tossing aside the risk of inflation, which was front and center less than six months ago for most investors. \n\n \n\n  Barron's: What's your sense of opportunities in value stocks versus growth stocks? \n\n  Arnott: When you look at price-to-book values, the spread between growth stocks and value stocks was at its narrowest ever, just two years ago; now, it's the widest spread ever with the sole exception of the bubble year, in 2000, and we saw what happened after that: seven years in which value drastically and reliably outperformed growth. We could see something similar [now], whereby value sharply outperforms growth. The value side of the market, like much of the bond market, is priced for a depression. The growth side of the market is priced for recession. \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 20, 2008 00:04 ET (05:04 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257423Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T13:58:19.823822Z", "inner_id": 359, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5728, "annotations": [{"id": 6080, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "_P1-1HWe8h", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:52:02.692214Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:52:02.692249Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 3.455, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "191647b6-aa5a-48c3-9181-0fb7675b8f24", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5728, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "NYH, USG Jet Fuel Differentials: End of Day Recap\n\n   ===== NYH Jet Fuel =====    ====== USG Jet Fuel ===== \n                 54 Grade                      54 Grade \n DATE:      PROMPT         ANY JAN        C 02ND         ANY FEB \n 12/30   + 8.00/+ 9.00       NQ        +  3.00/+3.50       NQ \n                                                         ANY JAN \n 12/29   + 7.00/+ 9.00  +7.00/+ 8.00   +  1.00/+1.50       NQ \n                                          C 72ND \n 12/26     N/A               N/A           N/A           N/A \n 12/25   HOLIDAY \n 12/24   + 6.25/+ 6.75       NQ        +  2.00/+3.00  +2.00/+3.00 \n 12/23   + 6.25/+ 6.75       NQ        +  1.00/+1.50  -3.00/+0.00 \n 12/22        N/A            NQ             N/A            NQ \n 12/19   + 4.50/+ 5.00       NQ        -  3.00/+0.00  -3.00/+0.00 \n 12/18   + 5.50/+ 6.00       NQ        -  4.25/-3.75  -4.25/-3.75 \n                                          C 71ST \n 12/17   + 4.50/+ 5.00       NQ        -  7.75/-7.25       NQ \n 12/16   + 4.50/+ 5.00       NQ        -  9.75/-9.25       NQ \n 12/15   + 2.75/+ 3.25       NQ        - 15.50/-15.00      NQ \n                                          C 69TH \n 12/12   + 2.75/+ 3.25       NQ        - 17.50/-17.00      NQ \n 12/11   + 1.75/+ 2.25       NQ        - 16.25/-15.75      NQ \n 12/10   - 1.00/  0.00       NQ              n/a           NQ \n 12/09   - 1.00/  0.00       NQ        - 24.00/-23.00      NQ \n 12/08   + 3.50/+ 4.00       NQ        - 10.50/-9.50       NQ \n 12/05   + 3.00/+ 4.00       NQ        -  9.50/-9.00       NQ \n                                          C 68TH \n 12/04   + 4.00/+ 4.50       NQ              NQ            NQ \n 12/03   + 1.25/+ 1.75       NQ        -  1.50/-1.00       NQ \n 12/02   +12.50/+13.00       NQ        -  1.50/-1.00       NQ \n 12/01   + 6.50/+ 7.00       NQ        +  0.00/+0.25       NQ \n                           ANY DEC                       ANY DEC \n                                          C 67TH \n 11/28        n/a           N/A              n/a           n/a \n 11/27       Holiday \n 11/26   + 5.50/+ 6.50  +5.50/+ 6.00   -  1.00/+1.00       NQ \n 11/25   + 7.75/+ 8.00  +7.75/+ 8.00   +  0.50/+1.00       NQ \n 11/24   + 8.00/+ 8.25  +8.00/+ 8.25   +  0.25/+0.50       NQ \n                                          C 66TH \n 11/21   + 6.00/+ 7.50       NQ        +  0.25/+2.50       NQ \n 11/20   + 5.00/+ 6.50       NQ        +  0.50/+1.00       NQ \n                                          C 65TH \n 11/19   + 8.00/+ 8.25       NQ        +  1.75/+2.25       NQ \nFor intraday prices search \"Jet Fuel Cash\";

This brought annual inflation down to 8.9% from a 14-year high of 9.9% the previous month. Despite the drop, annual inflation is still running well above the central bank's target of 3%, plus or minus one percentage point. \n\n  While headline inflation fell, core inflation, which factors out volatile fuel and produce prices, rose to an annualized 9.5% from 9.3%. \n\n  On the domestic front, the central bank said unemployment levels remain stable and local credit markets are tight. It added economic activity is showing signs of deceleration, while domestic demand, especially for imported goods, is lower than expected. \n\n  Regarding the international economy, the central bank said access to credit is still \"showing tension, and the most recent data available confirms a significant deceleration in the global economy.\" \n\n  The bank noted that commodities prices, especially copper and crude-oil prices, have continued to drop. \n\n  The monetary authority reiterated its commitment to managing monetary policy so as to bring inflation back down to its target of 3% in its 24-month policy horizon. \n\n \n\n  Central bank web site: http://www.bcentral.cl \n\n \n\n  -By Carolina Pica, Dow Jones Newswires; 56-2-820-4244; carolina.pica@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=OBSC4tG5tv93CjIHwO9G9A%3D%3D.

Thank Fiscal Stimulus. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Jacob Sonenshine \n\n     The three major U.S. stock indexes were mixed Thursday, but beneath the surface, there was strength in the market. \n\n     The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68.95 points, or 0.22%, to close at 30,991.52. The S&P 500 slid 14.30 points, or 0.38%, to end at 3,795.54, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.31 points, or 0.12%, to close at 13,112.64. The biggest gainer in the S&P 500 was petroleum refiner HollyFrontier (ticker: HFC), with an 11% stock surge. \n\n     President-elect Joe Biden is expected to speak in the evening in detail about fiscal stimulus. Trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus have already shored up consumers' savings, and a few trillion dollars more would add to the pent-up demand that could be unleashed when Covid-19 vaccines are widely distributed. \n\n     Investors remain upbeat about the trajectory of the economy. While the major indexes were down, stocks most sensitive to perceived changes in the economy, such as value and small-caps, were up. The market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 was dragged lower by megacap tech stocks including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), which fell 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. \n\n     But the Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index Fund ETF (VOOV) rose 0.37%. The Russell 2000, an index of small-caps, rose 2%. Small-caps are not only expected to see roughly twice the earnings rebound than large caps will see in 2021, but the smaller names also still trade at a valuation discount to larger ones, giving small-caps even more upside potential. \n\n     The average Russell 2000 component stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple roughly in line with the average stock on the Russell 1000, which includes some S&P 500 stocks, according to figures from UBS Wealth Management. Historically, the average Russell 2000 forward P/E multiple has a slight premium to that of the Russell 1000, suggesting that there's some upside for the smaller caps of the former. \n\n     \"I am far more pleased to be holding an overweight in small-caps right now,\" Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, told Barron's. \n\n     Another signal of optimism on the economy: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which reflects how broadly -- across sectors -- stocks rallied, rose 0.36%. \n\n     Investors are seeing \"more of the commitment to stimulus and the magnitude of stimulus that will be introduced and most likely passed and the fact that it seems to have bipartisan support,\" Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, told Barron's. \n\n     A report from Evercore strategists noted the reasons Treasury yields rose was because there are reports that Biden's stimulus plan could total $2 trillion, higher than some calls of late for $1 trillion. Rising treasury yields usually reflect rising inflation and economic expectations. \n\n     Negatively, initial jobless claims came in worse than expected, although investors shrugged that off. Claims came in at 965,000 for last week, larger than the consensus average for 800,000, and larger than the previous week's revised tally of 784,000, as lockdowns persisted. \n\n     \"At a certain point tough jobs numbers like we saw this morning can serve as the tinder for those calling for a correction, but the market's view seems to be that the light at the end of the tunnel remains in sight, despite a plodding vaccination rollout.\" Mike Loewengart, head of investment strategy at E*Trade, wrote in emailed remarks to the media. \n\n     Write to Jacob Sonenshine at jacob.sonenshine@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 14, 2021 17:01 ET (22:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257519Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:52:48.736652Z", "inner_id": 362, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5731, "annotations": [{"id": 6083, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "X6j4PdZuG6", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:53:28.327776Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:53:28.327811Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 38.806, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "4ef79427-586e-46a6-8085-aa0fdf4d5458", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5731, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "EUROPEAN MIDDAY BRIEFING: Stocks Fall as Biden&apos;s Stimulus Plan Fails to Cheer\n\n  MARKET WRAPS \n\n  Stocks: \n\n  European stocks fell on Friday, alongside U.S. stock futures, as the announcement of a highly anticipated stimulus plan from President-elect Joe Biden failed to cheer investors, who remain concerned over climbing COVID-19 cases on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n  The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.4% in a week that has seen it drop around 0.2%. The German DAX fell 0.4%, the French CAC dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 traded 0.6% lower as well. \n\n  France will impose a nationwide 6 p.m. curfew on Saturday, with initial plans for 15 days to battle climbing cases. Spain reported 38,869 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the highest on record and three times the worst level seen in the first wave with hospitalizations rising. \n\n  \"There is renewed enthusiasm about the U.S. due to the prospects for more stimulus and the new administration's pledge to focus on the vaccinations' rollout. Meanwhile, Europe recovery is throttled by additional lockdowns and a fumbled vaccine rollout program,\" said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at Axi, in a note to clients. \n\n  The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics reported that the country's economy shrank 2.6% in November, after six straight months of growth since lockdowns in the spring. But that was less than the 4% drop forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. \n\n  Among stocks on the move, shares of technology names were lower \n\n  Shares of SAP climbed over 2%, after the German software giant pre-announced fourth-quarter results, reporting a sequential improvement \"even as the COVID-19 crisis persisted and lockdowns were reintroduced in many regions.\" \n\n  Carrefour's shares were again on the decline, dropping 3% after the French government voiced objections to prospects of a takeover for the supermarket owner when it and Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard announced early-stage talks earlier in the week. \n\n  U.S. Markets: \n\n  Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, indicating the benchmark index may decline for a second day. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq-100 edged less than 0.1% lower and those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%. \n\n  The S&P 500 is on track to end the week lower, erasing some of the gains made in early January when the gauge rallied to a record high. Markets have for weeks cheered Democrats' plans to expand government spending and bolster the economic rebound. But the size of Mr. Biden's plans, laid out late Thursday, served to check some of that optimism. \n\n  \"The magnitude obviously was surprising on the upside,\" said Wei Li, head of investment strategy for BlackRock's exchange-traded fund and index investments for Europe, Middle East and Africa. \"With the Senate majority, [taxes] could be coming in the medium term and that is something the market has to assess as well.\" \n\n  Investors are hoping that additional spending will help steer the U.S. economy through a winter that has seen high Covid-19 infection rates and worsening economic data. Figures released Thursday showed that the number of workers filing for jobless benefits posted its biggest weekly gain since the pandemic hit last March. \n\n  \"When you see data this bad, you have to question if the prevailing expectation-for cyclical recovery to come through-if that would be shaken,\" Ms. Li said. \n\n  Data on U.S. retail sales in December, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, will offer more insight into the strength of consumer spending and the severity of the broader economic slowdown at the end of the year. \n\n  Investors will also get an indication of how confident American households are when the University of Michigan releases preliminary January figures for its consumer sentiment index at 10 a.m. ET. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. \n\n  Despite days that see a pullback in markets, investors still expect that the additional fiscal stimulus will support a rally in stocks this year. \n\n  \"Ultimately, you can't expect equities to go up every day in a straight line,\" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"The numbers are really quite incredible and I think it is going to all add up to a boom in growth once the vaccines are rolled out.\" \n\n  Ahead of the opening bell, major U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings starting at about 6:45 a.m. ET. Much of the focus is likely to be on the banks' forecasts for 2021. \n\n  Forex: \n\n  The dollar may strengthen further in tandem with U.S. government bond yields after President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Thursday but the gains won't last, Commerzbank said. \n\n  EUR/USD levels below 1.20 seem \"quite justified\" over coming months as the stimulus will support the U.S. economy, lifting yields and the dollar, Commerzbank's Esther Reichelt said. \n\n  However, EUR/USD should rise slowly over the medium-term as the \"continued and significant overvaluation\" of the dollar is no longer justified due to the Federal Reserve's promise to only consider an interest rate rise once full employment is achieved and inflation exceeds 2% for some time, she said. \n\n  EUR/USD fell 0.1% and the dollar index roses 0.2%. \n\n  The pound fell in early trade, turning lower after hitting an eight-week high against the euro on Thursday and showing little reaction after data showed U.K. gross domestic product shrank less than expected in November. \n\n  The figures can largely be ignored due to their stale nature, FX firm Caxton said. \n\n  The economy contracted 2.6% in November, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, following six consecutive months of growth, but the contraction was much less severe than the 4.0% drop forecast in a Wall Street Journal poll. \n\n  In addition, the U.K. trade deficit was wider than forecast for November. GBP/USD fell 0.2%, while EUR/GBP edged slightly higher. \n\n  Bonds: \n\n  In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked lower to 1.109%, from 1.128% Thursday. \n\n  Commodities: \n\n  Brent crude oil was down 1.1% and WTI futures were down 0.8% on a combination of bearish headlines. \n\n  OPEC said Thursday it expects global demand this year to undershoot pre-coronavirus levels, with rising infection numbers and lockdown measures continuing to stymie an economic recovery in many countries. \n\n  Meanwhile, the highest number of new Covid-19 cases in 10 months in China --whose oil demand has proven resilient in recent months-- is also giving investors cause for concern according to CMC Markets's David Madden. \n\n  That news is counteracting comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about interest rates being kept low, which weighed on the dollar and boosted oil Thursday. \n\n  Gold was unchanged despite President-elect Joe Biden's plans for a near-$2-trillion stimulus package. Futures were flat at $1,851.90 a troy ounce. \n\n  Overnight, gold moved in the opposite direction to Treasury yields, which initially rose before easing back. \n\n  The limited response of both yields and gold to Biden's plans could suggest investors are doubting how much of it will be acceptable to the U.S. Senate, said Jeffrey Halley at Oanda. \n\n  The Democrats have a razor-thin Senate majority, but not all parts of Biden's plans can be passed by a simple majority--some will require bipartisan support, he said. \n\n  \"Given the distaste Republicans have for state aid, Mr. Biden's bipartisan hopes will be immediately tested,\" said Halley. \n\n \n \n\n  EMEA HEADLINES \n\n  SAP Forecasts Flat Revenue After Fourth-Quarter Rebound \n\n  SAP late Thursday pre-announced fourth quarter financial results, as the German enterprise software giant continues an aggressive push to shift its business to the cloud. \n\n  \"In a uniquely challenging environment, 2020 was a record year for cash flow in every single quarter and the full year,\" CFO Luka Mucic said in a statement. \"Our better-than-anticipated top line performance combined with our quick response on the cost side drove strong operating profit. SAP's expedited shift to the cloud will drive long-term, sustainable growth while significantly increasing the resiliency and predictability of our business.\" \n\n \n \n\n  Eurozone Trade Rebound Continues \n\n  Exports from and imports into the eurozone rose for a seventh straight month in November, even as a fresh rise in new coronavirus infections prompted further government restrictions across the currency area. \n\n  The European Union's statistics agency on Friday said that the currency area's exports of goods to the rest of the world exceeded imports by 25.8 billion euros ($31.36 billion) in November, a larger surplus than the EUR20.2 billion recorded in November 2019. \n\n \n \n\n  UK Economy Shrinks Amid Coronavirus Restrictions \n\n  The U.K. economy shrank in November, highlighting the economic cost of restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n  The British economy shrank 2.6% in November, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, following six consecutive months of growth since lockdowns in the spring. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 4.0% drop. \n\n \n \n\n  U.K. GDP Shrinks in November: A Roundup of Economists' Views \n\n  The U.K.'s economy contracted by a less-than-expected 2.6% in November as the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic took hold.

The company is also targeting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization after leases of roughly EUR2.5 billion for 2026, compared with approximately EUR1.5 billion in 2020. \n\n \n \n\n  Rio Tinto, BHP Copper Project Set to Clear Hurdle for Key Land Swap \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 15, 2021 06:14 ET (11:14 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257562Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:53:28.549410Z", "inner_id": 363, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5732, "annotations": [{"id": 6084, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "gryfy495Bn", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:54:13.564281Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:54:13.564307Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 41.175, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3a7ccfd0-d130-41c3-a6da-162aaea8b2ee", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5732, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Suppliers Struggle to Keep Up With Output -- WSJ\n\nBy Bob Tita | Photographs by Nolis Anderson for The Wall Street Journal \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (January 25, 2021). \n\n     A quicker-than-expected recovery in U.S. manufacturing is resulting in supply disruptions and higher costs for materials used in everything from kitchen cabinets to washing machines to automobiles. \n\n     Consumers unable to spend on vacations, dining out and concerts instead have opened their wallets for appliances and other improvements to their current or new homes. Car sales also rebounded faster than expected in the second half of 2020. As a result, prices for some industrial commodities used in those products, such as steel and copper, have climbed to their highest levels in years. \n\n     The increased demand for these materials is showing up in manufacturers' supply chains, which are clogged with orders, causing some producers to add weekend hours and overtime for employees. Orders that took a week or two to fill during the summer now require six to eight weeks, according to manufacturers coping with extended wait times for essential supplies. \n\n     \"The lack of availability is what kills you,\" said Mark Verhein, president of Church Metal Spinning Co., a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of steel parts for large industrial engines. \"If you can't get the material, that's vexing.\" \n\n     When many factories shut down for more than a month last spring to contain the spread of the coronavirus, production of industrial commodities dropped off as well. Inventories evaporated, and suppliers were wary about ramping up production during what was expected to be a slow recovery for manufacturing in a U.S. economy that had entered into a recession in February. But demand for durable goods such as automobiles and appliances picked up in late summer and gained momentum during fall even as Covid-19 infections soared to record levels. \n\n     U.S. commodity producers have benefited as well from strengthening global prices and increasing demand, particularly for aluminum. Its cash price on the London Metal Exchange is up 39% from its April low, according to S&P Global Platts. The domestic price for prime steel scrap used to make new steel has risen 60% since November, aided by increased overseas demand. Turkey has sought out U.S. exports, and lately so too has China, which is importing scrap for the first time in nearly a decade. \n\n     \"We can sell everything we have,\" said Brad Serlin, president of United Scrap Metal Inc., near Chicago. \"Steel mills that were out of the market all of a sudden are doing big orders.\" \n\n     Domestic steel mills in need of scrap started accepting shipments on Saturdays in late October for the first time in years, Mr. Serlin said. \n\n     Mr. Verhein of Church Metal said he had to delay deliveries of some orders because the parts maker couldn't obtain enough steel, and that which the company is able to buy costs twice as much as six months ago. \n\n     He said on some products he is opting to make less profit for now, rather than pass along higher prices to his customers. For other products where margins were already thin, Mr. Verhein said he has no choice but to raise Church's prices to avoid losing money. \n\n     Some manufacturers have stockpiled materials to guard against a lack of availability in the future. They are counting on being able to quickly recover the added cost of holding more inventory than usual with increased sales. \n\n     Optimas OE Solutions LLC, a manufacturer of bolts and fasteners, recently accumulated $2 million worth of steel wire at its Wood Dale, Ill., plant, up from $250,000 before the pandemic erupted in the U.S. last March. \n\n     \"That's going to give us an edge,\" Chief Executive Marc Strandquist said. \"The supply chains everywhere are running ragged right now. We can smother our customers with service.\" \n\n     Mr. Strandquist said orders for fasteners from the commercial truck industry and farm machinery manufacturers have been strong lately, as demand for such equipment recovers from a slump that started before the pandemic. \n\n     Even as demand improves though, some manufacturers say they haven't been able to recover all their higher costs for materials. \n\n     At Northwest Hardwoods Inc., orders for lumber used in kitchen cabinets, flooring and the trim around doors and windows are up about 15% from a year ago on increasing construction of new homes. But the company said the cost of obtaining and processing maple and oak logs has been rising more than the prices it can charge for finished boards. Output at sawmills also is constrained by labor shortages. \n\n     \"It's not great on our margins,\" Chief Executive Nathan Jeppson said. \"I don't know of anybody who is making a lot of money.\" \n\n     Since November, the Tacoma, Wash., company has been operating under bankruptcy protection that it attributed to collapsing orders from the pandemic last spring and falling exports to China because of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. lumber imposed in 2018. \n\n     Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 25, 2021 02:32 ET (07:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257606Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:54:13.774933Z", "inner_id": 364, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5733, "annotations": [{"id": 6085, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "wjvL8rRaUq", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:55:05.534617Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:55:05.534654Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 51.022, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "ad440e0a-f2f8-4a4f-93d8-fd14ec78f5ad", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5733, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "New York Transit Officials to Vote on Fare Increase\n\nBy Paul Berger \n\n     Leaders of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority are expected to decide this month whether to raise fares on New York City's subway and bus systems and regional commuter rails at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a financial toll on many of its riders. \n\n     The MTA, the operator of the nation's largest transit system, instituted a schedule a decade ago of raising fare and toll revenues by about 4% every two years to keep pace with inflation. The authority's board members are slated to vote on increases to fares on Jan. 21 and on tolls next month. \n\n     Some board members want to delay the latest fare increases, which could take effect in the spring, because so many people are out of work. They also say the extra millions of dollars the increase could raise wouldn't dent the authority's expected deficits, which measure in the billions. \n\n     \"This isn't the time to do this,\" said David Jones, one of four voting MTA board members who represent Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. \n\n     Mr. Jones said he is considering asking for the fare vote to be delayed until at least the middle of the year. By that time he hopes the authority will have a clearer view of its finances, the regional economy and employment levels. \n\n     Robert Linn, another of Mr. de Blasio's appointees, said he favors imposing a fare increase that doesn't take effect until January 2022. Mr. Linn noted that the MTA recently secured $4 billion in the latest coronavirus aid package, which should see the authority through 2021. \n\n     Mr. Linn added that with mass-transit ridership down between 50% or more, an increase this year wouldn't generate much revenue. But it would hurt people like grocery-store and health-care workers who have continued to commute to work during the pandemic. \n\n     The state-controlled MTA is desperate for revenue. It balanced its 2020 budget using a $3.9 billion federal bailout and by borrowing more than $3 billion in short-term debt from the Federal Reserve's emergency lending program. \n\n     The MTA board is dominated by six appointees of Gov. Andrew Cuomo who control a plurality of its 14 votes and who are often supported by members recommended by the executives of outlying counties. \n\n     Transit advocates say Mr. Cuomo should find alternative ways of raising revenue such as taxing wealth and income rather than raising prices for essential workers. \"The governor needs to find progressive revenue raisers,\" said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for advocacy group Riders Alliance. \n\n     Representatives of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, declined to comment. Lawrence Schwartz, one of six voting board members appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said he didn't want to take a public position before he had a chance to discuss options with board colleagues ahead of and during their Jan. 21 meeting. \"I think there may be ways to generate the revenue the MTA needs without hurting people that rely on the system the most,\" he said. \n\n     Mr. Schwartz repeated previous comments he has made that he would like to keep the base fare for a subway or bus ride at $2.75 or discount it further. He also noted that the MTA loses a significant amount of revenue to fraud associated with people tampering with seven-day and 30-day unlimited Metrocards. Previously, he has suggested considering the elimination of some unlimited cards. \n\n     The authority held a series of public hearings at the end of last year to receive comments on a long list of fare and toll proposals that include eliminating seven-day and 30-day unlimited MetroCards and raising the base subway and bus fare to $3. The proposals also include a flat fare for most commuter rail riders and varying tolls at bridges and tunnels based on time of day. \n\n     Abbey Collins, an MTA spokeswoman, said, \"We recognize our customers are facing unprecedented hardship and the MTA Board will take all this into consideration as well as the thousands of public comments received after eight virtual hearings when making its decision.\" \n\n     The MTA was in a fiscal crisis before the pandemic hit the New York metropolitan region in early 2020. Its precarious financial plan for the coming years, which assumed biennial fare and toll increases, included projected annual shortfalls of hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\n     The authority has reduced costs by freezing nonessential hiring and cutting contracts with consultants. Without federal aid, authority officials warn they may have to cut transit service by 40% or 50%. \n\n     \"We feel that the right balance right now would be to continue fare and toll increases as scheduled because the fiscal situation is so dire,\" said Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog, Citizens Budget Commission. \n\n     During normal times, the MTA carries about eight million people each weekday on two commuter railroads and on New York City's subway and bus systems. Its seven bridges and two tunnels earned revenue in 2019 of about $2 billion. \n\n     Although traffic at the authority's tolled crossings has almost recovered since the region shut down earlier last year, the authority doesn't expect mass-transit ridership to return to near pre-pandemic levels until 2024. \n\n     The Democratic victory in Georgia's Senate runoff elections on Jan. 5, which handed Democrats control of the U.S. Senate, has given officials hope the MTA could receive further federal aid. \n\n     They are also optimistic the incoming Biden administration will help to advance a congestion-pricing program to charge drivers entering Manhattan's central business district, which should raise billions of dollars to fund transit improvements. The plan, which requires federal approval, stalled under the Trump administration. It was supposed to begin around now. \n\n     Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 10, 2021 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257642Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:55:05.765914Z", "inner_id": 365, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5734, "annotations": [{"id": 6086, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "JKcA0RSufZ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T15:55:41.659982Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:55:41.660007Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 35.166, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "57735f37-d64c-463c-90da-e06c1a6a7781", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5734, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Global Markets Push Higher Ahead of Yellen&apos;s Senate Testimony -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Jack Denton \n\n     Global stocks pushed further into the green on Tuesday, ahead of the closely watched Congressional testimony of U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, who is expected to advocate for fiscal policy to \"act big\" with interest rates at historic lows. \n\n     In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 1.39%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 2.7%. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.83%. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2%. Paris' CAC 40 was trading just below flat and Frankfurt's DAX was up near 0..3%. The U.S. premarket looked set for a strong open, with Dow futures pointing up 150 points after U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. \n\n     Former Federal Reserve chair Yellen will have the opportunity to sell President-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan. Her confirmation hearing to the Senate Finance Committee will begin against the backdrop of an American economy continuing to struggle under the burden of the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n     \"Yellen will also need to convince the more skeptical cohort of U.S. lawmakers that the new Biden fiscal plan, where there is agreement on another $1,400 stimulus check, but where the increases in the minimum wage and other safety net programs, are slightly more problematic, won't cause an unsustainable rise in the U.S. national debt,\" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. \n\n     \"This is the main concern of the more fiscally conservative U.S. lawmakers, and something that Janet Yellen will have to use all of her political skills to convince is necessary in the short term at least,\" Hewson added. \n\n     The dollar slipped on Tuesday by around 0.25%, as analysts considered whether Yellen would be a positive or negative force on the U.S. currency. \n\n     \"She's likely to emphasize the need to get employment back to where it was before the pandemic rather than worrying about inflation,\" said Marshall Gittler, an analyst at BDSwiss. \"That could be negative for the dollar. At the same time, she may also emphasize that the U.S. doesn't have a policy of weakening the dollar deliberately, which could be positive for the dollar.\" \n\n     The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that passenger-car registrations fell by 3.3% in December 2020 compared with the year prior, topping off the worst year on record -- registrations in 2020 fell 24%. European car makers' stocks broadly fell, with Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW, and Renault all in the red. \n\n     Yet shares in Stellantis, the automotive giant formed out of the merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, were up close to 5%, extending the 7% rally yesterday in the stock's first day of trading. \n\n     But many of the winners and losers in global trading were tied to earnings as the reporting season gets under way. Analysts are closely watching how companies are faring almost a year into the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n     Shares in London-listed mining giant Rio Tinto rose close to 1% after it reported that industrial activity in China, a key market, had rebounded to pre-Covid-19 levels, helping boost iron ore shipments in the fourth quarter by 2%. \n\n     But it isn't a sweet day of trading for Swiss chocolatier Lindt, which said that sales in 2020 melted 6.1% to 4.02 billion Swiss francs -- below expectations. The stock slipped more than 2%. \n\n     It's a quiet day on the data front, with year-over-year Chinese foreign direct investment due. As well, the International Energy Agency lowered forecasts for oil demand in the coming quarter by 600,000 barrels a day, as continued lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19 are expected to slow the recovery in crude prices. \n\n     It will be a big day for U.S. corporate earnings.

While actual spending increased by 1% in 2020, the survey for 1Q revised estimated capex for 2021 higher by NOK7.3 billion to NOK174 billion, which suggests a much smaller fall this year than previously expected. The first estimate for 2022 showed that oil investment next year is estimated to decline 20.2% relative to the latest estimate for 2021. Although the 2022 estimate will likely be increased in future surveys, it still suggests the investment outlook remains bleak, SEB says.

UBS says Rio's earnings per share were 6% ahead of market consensus while the full-year dividend was 16% ahead of forecasts.

Bloomberg reports that U.S. oil production has dropped 3.5 million barrels a day and Occidental has issued a force majeure to buyers as a result of the supply disruptions, ING's Warren Patterson says.

This morning, Brent took another dip to $62.73 before posting a strong rebound and crossing above the $63.75 resistance that has been in place since Feb. 15, turning the intraday bias bullish. It has since swung back to the upper Bollinger band, while the relative strength index is well directed in the 60s, indicating continued upward momentum for Brent. A further rally should push Brent toward $64.25 and $64.70 on the upside. Only a return to key support at $63.25--just below the 50-period moving average--would bring about a bearish reversal. April Brent is trading at around $63.81 a barrel.

However, the collateral damage could include higher borrowing costs for businesses, more options for investors who had seen few alternatives to stocks and less favorable valuation models for some hot technology shares, investors and analysts said. \n\n     As of Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 1.344%, up from 1.157% just five trading sessions earlier and roughly 0.9% at the start of the year. \n\n     The S&P fell 0.7% for the week, dragged down largely by technology stocks, which after big gains in recent years are seen as especially vulnerable to rising yields. Banks, meanwhile, rose as investors bet that higher long-term interest rates would make their lending activity more profitable. \n\n     \"The market's wobbled a little bit,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, an investment advisory and brokerage firm. \"The market has principally been saying hooray, the pandemic is coming under control and the economy is starting to grow again. But now we're actually starting to see the consequences of that in the form of higher rates, and I think the market's processing that.\" \n\n     Stuck near historic lows for most of last year, Treasury yields have climbed in recent months along with investors' expectations for a strong economic rebound, driven in part by more debt-financed government spending. \n\n     The move over the past week caught investors' attention because no specific catalyst was apparent. That raised the prospect that yields could rise more quickly and unpredictably than expected -- an outcome that many believe would be more disruptive to other assets like stocks than a slow, orderly climb. \n\n     Rising yields, which result from falling bond prices, often reflect investor expectations of faster growth and an accompanying rise in inflation, which makes the interest payments of bonds less valuable. A pickup in inflation could also eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, though most investors don't expect that to happen in the near term. More government borrowing could boost yields as well just by increasing the supply of bonds. \n\n     Investors this week will monitor the latest developments in Washington, where House Democrats hope to finalize a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, as well as figures on consumer spending and earnings from consumer companies like Home Depot Inc. and Macy's Inc. \n\n     They will also keep watching Treasury yields, whose rise can hurt stocks in a few different ways, according to investors and analysts. \n\n     As yields move up, borrowing costs for most businesses should also rise, crimping profits. Higher yields could also prompt some risk-averse investors to sell stocks and return to government and corporate bonds, now that they will earn a more meaningful return. \n\n     Finally, many investors use the 10-year Treasury yield as a discount rate in formulas to value stocks. All else being equal, the expected cash flows of companies are considered less valuable when yields are higher. That could threaten many tech stocks because much of their earnings are expected to come further in the future. \n\n     Treasury yields remain extremely low by historical standards but aren't so low relative to stock prices, some argue. In recent years, the 12-month forward-earnings yield of world technology companies -- their expected earnings per share as a percentage of their stock price -- has generally exceeded the 10-year Treasury yield by at least 2.5 percentage points. \n\n     But the yield differential has recently fallen below that threshold, a sign that the stock-market rally that was previously justified by ultralow bond yields \"is turning irrational,\" Dhaval Joshi, chief European investment strategist at BCA Research, a Montreal-based investment research firm, wrote in a report last week. \n\n     Still, many investors aren't too worried about rising yields, seeing them mostly as a welcome sign that the economic outlook is improving. \n\n     \"Our base case is for the positives of a higher rate regime to outweigh the negatives,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \n\n     Many professional stock investors have already baked higher yields into their valuation models, and the largest tech companies generally have earnings that justify their prices, he added. \n\n     Even so, rising yields could cause investors to rethink their allocations to different sectors, Mr. Peron said. \n\n     His own team started adding exposure in the second half of last year to companies such as certain retail brands and online travel businesses that stand to benefit from an economic recovery and are less vulnerable to rising rates. \n\n     The impact on stocks depends a lot on how high and how quickly yields can rise, analysts said. A range of analysts forecast that the 10-year Treasury yield will reach anywhere from 1.5% to 2% by the end of the year, as investors start preparing for future rate increases from the Fed. \n\n     So far the sudden rise in yields reflect uncertainty about the future more than any tangible changes in the economy. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that core consumer prices, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, were essentially flat for the previous two months. \n\n     Treasury yields fell at the time, only to begin their latest steep ascent just two days later. \n\n     --Amrith Ramkumar and Karen Langley contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 21, 2021 17:10 ET (22:10 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257778Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T15:58:54.509970Z", "inner_id": 369, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5738, "annotations": [{"id": 6090, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "HNjGQkTn-n", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T18:07:40.660897Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T18:07:40.660923Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 29.526, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "9f97085a-3c72-4325-8f77-5bdbcf9a3e45", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5738, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Brent Crude Nears $60 Mark for First Time in 12 Months\n\n  Brent crude oil is approaching $60 a barrel for the first time in a year, after the coronavirus pandemic prompted intense market volatility and questions about the health of the global economy. Following a sleepy January, during which vaccine hopes and lockdown measures appeared to counterbalance one another, prices have climbed this week. Brent is on course to close out the week 8% higher thanks to several factors. The OPEC+ ministerial monitoring committee saw the alliance commit to complying with production cuts. \"They confirmed the existing plan for additional oil coming to the market but importantly it'll be slow and the market responded positively to that,\" says IHS Markit's Spencer Welch. The market has also responded well to news that the nations rolling out Covid-19 vaccination programs appear to be keeping to their planned timetables. While \"there's a long way to go on vaccines [...] it does appear that on a global level we are hopefully past the peak of infections,\" Welch says. The Brent futures curve has also signaled the tightest demand for physical barrels of oil since January 2020, analysts say. The next challenge oil producers face is keeping prices at their current level. Global inventories remain well above their five-year average. \"It won't take long for some of the OPEC+ member states to say 'we want to produce more,' and that will have a downward effect on prices,\" Welch says.

His dismissal has prompted concerns that his successor could move less aggressively to tighten monetary policy. \n\n     Mr. Kavcioglu, who had been working as a columnist at a pro-government newspaper, has publicly sided with Mr. Erdogan's preference for lower interest rates. \n\n     Economists were predicting a steep drop in the value of the Turkish lira when markets open on Monday morning, as investors move to scale back their exposure to Turkish assets until the likely course of policy becomes clearer. \n\n     \"It will cause chaos for the Turkish economy. You will see tomorrow morning when the markets are open,\" said Durmus Yilmaz, a former governor of the Turkish central bank and currently a member of parliament with the centrist opposition Iyi party. \n\n     A sharp decline in the value of Turkey's currency would ratchet up inflation, raise the cost of imported goods including oil, and hurt living standards for ordinary Turks, economists warned. \n\n     \"It really is puzzling. It makes no economic sense whatsoever,\" said Refet Gurkaynak, a leading Turkish economist at Bilkent University in Ankara, referring to Mr. Agbal's removal. \n\n     The firing of Mr. Agbal was the third time Mr. Erdogan has replaced a central bank chief in less than two years. Before the bank chief's ouster, the Turkish economy was already struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic, which wiped out tourism and slowed international trade, as well as a currency crisis that began in 2018. \n\n     The changer also comes as Mr. Erdogan has expanded his power within Turkey's political and economic system and asserted Turkey's influence abroad, intervening in wars in Syria, Libya, and the Caucasus region in recent years. \n\n     Within Turkey, the government is also intensifying a clampdown on some of Mr. Erdogan's opponents. Last week, a top Ankara prosecutor called for the banning of one of Turkey's largest political parties, the leftist People's Democratic Party, which the government accuses of having ties to a Kurdish militant group that is banned as a terrorist organization. \n\n     In the same set of decrees in which he fired Mr. Agbal, Mr. Erdogan withdrew Turkey from an international treaty known as the Istanbul Convention designed to combat violence against women, sparking criticism from women's groups and a rebuke from President Biden. Mr. Biden called the decision \"a disheartening step backward for the international movement to end violence against women globally.\" \n\n     After years of unpredictable policy-making, Mr. Agbal's tenure inspired confidence from foreign investors. When Mr. Agbal began raising interest rates last year, investors poured a net $4.6 billion back into Turkish lira assets. Turkey remains dependent on foreign funds to finance its current-account deficit. \n\n     As a result, Mr. Agbal's removal surprised investors and economists. The most recent interest rate increase came on March 18, when the bank lifted its benchmark rate to 19% from 17%, triggering a surge in the value of the lira. \n\n     The rate increases put Mr. Agbal at odds with Mr. Erdogan, who has repeatedly expressed a preference for low interest rates, espousing the unorthodox view that high interest rates lead to inflation. \"I don't believe my country will develop with high interest rates,\" he said in a speech to a business group in January. \n\n     The new central bank chief, Mr. Kavcioglu, also criticized the rate increases in his newspaper columns, fueling concerns among investors that he will reverse Mr. Agbal's policies. \n\n     \"There's a disappointment to the investment case that a lot of people, including me, were building that there would be a cap on inflation and now that looks much less likely,\" said Kieran Curtis, an emerging-markets fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. \n\n     The surprise change at the central bank is also fueling anxieties among some regular Turkish people who are worried about the country's economic and political trajectory. \n\n     \"In general, there is a problem with stability in the country.\" said Cihan Ilter, the 35-year-old manager of two restaurants in Istanbul. \n\n     \"In the past, this wasn't so. We felt the effects of such higher level economic decisions, perhaps in a year or more. But now, because Turkish economy is very fragile, we feel the effects immediately,\" he said. \n\n     The decision is also likely to have a long-lasting impact on the credibility of Turkey's central bank, making it difficult to assuage concerns over higher inflation and price stability, said Maya Senussi, a senior economist at Oxford Economics. \n\n     Under Mr. Agbal's predecessor, Murat Uysal, cheap lending rates intended to boost growth created gaping holes in the country's current account as Turkish businesses and households imported more than they exported. \n\n     Concerns over the current-account deficit and interest rates below that of inflation caused foreign investors to pull a net $13.4 billion out of local currency bonds and stocks in the first 10 months of 2020. \n\n     The capital flight accelerated the lira's decline. The central bank opted to sell foreign currencies, from its own reserves and dollars borrowed from domestic banks, to buy the lira. \n\n     \"Like many people I'm pretty flabbergasted,\" said Erik Meyersson, a senior economist at Swedish bank Handelsbanken. \"Because of the appointment of Agbal, you've gotten investors to come back and that's pretty extraordinary. Now those portfolio flows, they will most likely reverse.\" \n\n     Write to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 21, 2021 14:42 ET (18:42 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257877Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T18:09:20.502976Z", "inner_id": 372, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5741, "annotations": [{"id": 6093, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "ebxhGEDz7I", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T18:10:40.528956Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T18:10:40.528982Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 79.215, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "096bdb2e-a3e9-4330-97c6-71f5094fd35c", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5741, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "The Unstoppable Boom in IPOs Has to End Sometime. Right? -- Barron&apos;s\n\n  Newly public stocks are having impressive trading debuts. Yet the explosion in the number of SPACs and the skyhigh valuations are causing some investors to worry. Are there echoes of the dot-com bubble? \n\nBy Luisa Beltran \n\n     The market for new stocks is experiencing a moment of exuberance not seen in roughly 20 years. \n\n     So far this year, 302 U.S. initial public offerings have raised $102.3 billion as of March 10, according to Dealogic. That is up 763% from the 35 offerings, valued at $11 billion, for the same period in 2020. For all of 2020, there were 457 IPOs, collecting $167.8 billion. Before that, the high-water mark for IPOs came during the dot-com bubble of 1999 when 547 offerings raised about $108 billion. \n\n     More impressive than the volume has been the performance of these stocks. Over the past 12 months, the shares of 52 tech IPOs jumped an average of 65% on their first day of trading, according to data from Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor who studies the IPO market. \n\n     Some IPOs have simply rocketed. TRX Insurance Brokers (ticker: TIRX) began trading in January, and its shares jumped 1,000% from a $4 offer price before the Nasdaq halted trading on its first day. The stock closed at $63.44 on Wednesday, up 1,486% from the IPO. EZGO Technologies (EZGO), an e-bike maker, roared 353% during its market debut in January, while Cloopen Group Holding (RAAS), a cloud-based communications provider, rose a mere 200% on its first day last month. \n\n     This past week, the videogame platform Roblox (RBLX) -- a direct listing -- soared on its public market debut. Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean e-commerce firm, opened 81% above its IPO price, giving the company a market value of $114 billion. Other big names are expected to come to market later this year, including Robinhood, Marqeta, Coinbase Global, and Instacart. \n\n     Not everyone, however, is happy with the boom in new issues. Some IPO investors are growing more cautious of what they see as super-frothy valuations. \n\n     \"I'd be pretty surprised if many of these valuations were still standing at this level in 12 months time,\" says Mark Hawtin, an investment director at GAM Investments, a European-based asset manager with $120 billion in assets under management. \n\n     Hawtin, who runs the GAM Star Disruptive Growth fund, which invests in IPOs, says he is finding it harder to buy into new issues right now compared with six or nine months ago. \n\n     \"There are companies I really like but I can't justify buying them because their price is too high,\" he tells Barron's. \n\n     IPOs, after their first initial price move, typically match over time the performance of the S&P 500 but this has changed. Hawtin points to the Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund (IPO), which tracks new issues for their first two years. The ETF is up 139.6% over the last year, while the S&P 500 has gained 43.5%. IPOs are getting a bump not only in their quote price but in the aftermarket, Hawtin says. \"This is indicative of the stretched valuation they have,\" he says. \n\n     Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have been the hottest corner of the market. Of the 302 IPOs so far this year, 80% are SPACs. Roughly 240 of these blank-check companies, valued at nearly $76 billion, went public as of March 10 compared with just 13 SPACs that collected roughly $3.9 billion for the same period last year, Dealogic says. \n\n     Many SPACs attract investors speculating on what business they might merge with. But Hawtin says that until a deal is announced, they should trade at their $10 trust value, effectively a call option on what will be the combined company. \"When the [SPAC's share] of the combined deal is worth more [than the shell company's cash in trust], then it makes sense for the price to move up,\" he says. \n\n     The red-hot IPO market has been a product of a long-running bull market, low interest rates, and a flood of liquidity in stocks as investors have few other places \"where you can expect any meaningful yield,\" says Dan Rosen, a partner at Commerce Ventures. \n\n     His firm has invested in 72 tech start-ups, including Bill.com Holdings (BILL), and Rosen says the last six months have been the best time for companies seeking to go public in his 20-years as a venture capitalist. \n\n     The revived enthusiasm many small investors have for stocks -- highlighted by the frenzy in the shares of GameStop (GME) and the like -- has also helped the IPO market. While retail investors may not be able to get into an offering, they can buy shares on the first day of trading. \n\n     That has spurred strong aftermarket gains for newly public businesses. In 2020, 165 operating companies went public, producing an equally weighted average first-day return of 41.6%, Ritter says. So far this year, the average is 33%. \n\n     GAM's Hawtin pointed to retail investors who are \"very passionate\" about certain stocks. \"They want to buy it and they can buy it in the aftermarket, and they will pay whatever price they have to pay,\" he says. \n\n     Such enthusiasm can be risky. Many of the companies going public now aren't generating any earnings. \n\n     Ross Yarrow, managing director U.S. equities at Robert W. Baird, looked at the first-quarter results for companies that went public last year. He found that 81% were unprofitable. He also analyzed companies that went public in 2000, the peak of the dot-com bubble. Roughly 73% were unprofitable one quarter after the IPO. \n\n     Growth prospects seem to trump a lack of earnings for newly public companies. Airbnb (ABNB) and DoorDash (DASH) produced two of the biggest IPOs of 2020. Airbnb on Feb. 25 posted a near $4 billion loss during its first earnings report as a public company, and the stock jumped 13% the next day. The same day, DoorDash said that losses more than doubled in the fourth quarter, to $312 million, from the period a year ago. Shares added nearly 2% the next day. \n\n     Is this the dot-com boom-and-bust all over again? \n\n     Hawtin, who was also an investor in 1999, thinks the current frothiness is different from 20 years ago. Then, companies were not valued on revenue, but on \"eyeballs and users,\" he remembers. \n\n     This time around, he thinks only certain sectors and stocks are frothy. The IPO market is \"very overvalued,\" but companies going public right now come armed with significant revenue and real growth, Hawtin says. \n\n     University of Florida's Ritter notes that companies going public now \"are generally fairly mature, if not profitable, with the exception of the biopharma sector, where the firms tend to be young and still in the R&D stage.\" \n\n     While the IPO market shows no signs of cooling off anytime soon, a sharp increase in inflation or a geopolitical shock could put a stop to the market's frothiness, Commerce Venture's Rosen says. \n\n     GAM's Hawtin is more certain a correction is coming. \"It would be foolish to suggest now or next week is the moment it will turn,\" he says. \"I don't know the moment [the IPO market] will turn, but it will turn.

There are three main takeaways from today's ECB meeting, he says: First, the ECB will look through any temporary acceleration of inflation and expects inflation to slow down again next year; second, the ECB will front-load asset purchases in the coming months to underline its willingness to look through higher inflation and limit further bond yield increases; and third, the change of the balance of risk for the economic outlook suggests that any increase in the total size of the asset purchases is still far out and unlikely.

Some 19,000 vessels crossed the Suez in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority. \n\n     The passage is a particular choke point for the energy industry, with about one-tenth of the world's seaborne oil trade flowing through it and the associated Sumed -- or Suez-Mediterranean -- pipeline in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. \n\n     On Wednesday, dozens of oil and liquefied-natural gas tankers were caught in congestion, according to commodities data company Kpler. \n\n     Traders said at least six cargoes of liquefied-natural gas from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, destined for Europe and Asia, were stuck but noted the congestion shouldn't be that problematic if resolved quickly. \n\n     \"It's not a big issue if fixed today, if it lasts it could be interesting,\" said a gas trader. \n\n     International crude prices were up more than 3%, a move some analysts attributed to worry about oil shipments. \n\n     Meanwhile, shares of some big shipping companies fell, with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. down 4.6% and Nippon Yusen K.K. dropping 5.1%, amid expectations that the blockage could lead to delays and higher costs. \n\n     Around 30 container ships sailing from Asia to Europe cross the Canal every week moving roughly 380,000 containers according to Lars Jensen, chief executive of Denmark-based SeaIntelligence Consulting. \n\n     \"If we assume that vessels are full, this means 55,000 containers of cargo from Asia to Europe daily. The expectation is that it will take some two days to clear the canal, which will cause the delay of 110,000 containers,\" Mr. Jensen said. \"This increases the risk we will see port congestion in European ports one week from now.\" \n\n     Clarksons Platou Securities said that if the ship were to be stuck for days, freight rates for box ships would head higher. Rates from Asia to Europe and across the Pacific have already been hovering at record levels over the past four months amid booming demand from e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Target Inc. after the Covid-19 imposed lockdowns. \n\n     \"While we would expect this to be a short-lived effect, the container ship industry is already very tight on capacity, with significant port congestion around the world,\" the investment bank said. \n\n     Container xChange, an online marketplace for renting or buying shipping containers, said Wednesday's delays would likely further push up rental prices for containers, which have already soared to $2,000 from $200 a container in the last three months, according to Co-CEO Johannes Schlingmeier. \n\n     Mr. Schlingmeier said his customers, about 550 freight-forwarding companies, were concerned about a possible new upsurge in pricing, especially since they appeared to be easing over the last two weeks due to the end of Lunar New Year. \n\n     Clients \"are afraid that this new event will just destroy these positive effects immediately again,\" he said. \n\n     The extent of the blockage's impact on electronics makers, already suffering from a crunch to the supply of chips, caused by a surge in demand for gaming consoles and laptops during lockdowns, is still unknown. \n\n     Only a handful of suppliers such as Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. make more than half the world's chips, although many companies in the industry ship products by air. For that reason the blockage is \"more likely to affect the finished goods than the chip manufacturers themselves,\" said Alan Priestley, an analyst covering emerging technology for Gartner Research. Recent shortages have raised semiconductor prices, but it was too early to see if today's disruption would push them higher, he added. \n\n     Peaks and troughs in demand for chips isn't unusual, but recent months have seen exaggerated effects that the industry isn't used to, said Tim Whitfield, chief of engineering at Imagination Technologies Group PLC, a semiconductor designer based in the U.K., who is monitoring the Suez disruption for its potential impact on the industry. \n\n     He said the blockage was the latest in a sequence of problematic events for the supply of chips: Earlier this month a fire at an automotive chip factory in Japan sent further reverberations through the chip supply chain. \"There seems to be a bit of a perfect storm at the moment,\" Mr. Whitfield said. \n\n     Write to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com, Parmy Olson at parmy.olson@wsj.com and Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 24, 2021 10:49 ET (14:49 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.257986Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T18:22:14.449662Z", "inner_id": 375, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5744, "annotations": [{"id": 6096, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "d5hA78ekf5", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T18:58:55.084713Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T18:58:55.084739Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 2199.851, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "c6064fb1-20a0-4086-b3d2-e9c979203629", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5744, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Raises Selic Rate to 2.75%, Sees Another Hike at Next Meeting\n\n \n   By Jeffrey T. Lewis \n \n\n  SAO PAULO--Brazil's central bank raised its benchmark lending rate Wednesday to try to slow recent price increases even as the economy is hit by the country's intensifying Covid-19 outbreak. \n\n  The Central Bank of Brazil raised the Selic to 2.75%, the first change to the rate since the bank cut it to a record low of 2% last August, and said it expects the Monetary Policy Committee to raise the rate by the same amount at its next meeting if the economy continues to evolve as expected. \n\n  \"For the next meeting, unless there is a significant change in inflation projections or in the balance of risks, the committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment, of the same magnitude, in the degree of monetary stimulus,\" the statement said. \n\n  The bank faces the difficult task of attacking rising prices while the country's economy flounders. Food prices rose rapidly in the closing months of 2020, and a weaker currency and higher costs for oil have pushed fuel prices up sharply this year just as the pandemic has spurred state governments to impose stronger social-distancing measures. \n\n  Consumer prices rose 5.2% in February from a year earlier, brushing up against the 5.25% upper limit of the central bank's target range. The bank's weekly survey of economists forecasts the 12-month inflation rate will slow to 4.6% by the end of this year, still considerably above the 3.75% center point of the range for 2021. \n\n  \"This year we'll have the experience of weaker growth amid rising prices, but as long as the central bank remains vigilant and fights the second-round effects of change in relative prices, we should be OK,\" said Roberto Secemski, an economist at Barclays in New York. \n\n  Economists have been trimming their forecasts for gross domestic product as the pandemic has gotten worse, with the central bank's survey showing expectations for an expansion of 3.23% this year, down from 3.41% at the start of 2021. \n\n \n\n  Write to Jeffrey T.

(7 p.m. ET) \n\n   Top Stories Weird Science \n\n  After the worst year for the global economy since the Great Depression, the U.S. is set to lead a vigorous rebound in the West as mass vaccination against Covid-19 propels a return to more or less normal life. The revival will come in stages, with the U.S. and countries such as the U.K. recovering faster than those in the European Union, as the timing and speed of recoveries will depend largely on the pace and reach of vaccination, economists say. Economies in North America and Europe are expected to fire up as shops, restaurants and hotels throng with newly inoculated consumers armed with savings they amassed during the long pandemic. Moody's Analytics estimates households world-wide had $5.4 trillion in pandemic-related savings at the end of the first quarter, Jason Douglas and Paul Hannon report. \n\n  Data Thursday are expected to show that U.S. growth accelerated in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions eased and vaccination coverage increased. A separate report Friday is expected to show the 19-nation eurozone shrank in the first quarter, though more up-to-date business surveys suggest growth was already coming back in April. \n\n  Markets for everything from home-building materials to bitcoin to stocks are soaring, stirring up fresh fears that global markets are in a bubble . Rarely have so many assets been up this much at once. The price of lumber has shot up to all-time highs. Residential home sales in the U.S. are at levels last seen in 2006, before the housing bubble collapsed. And stocks are on a tear. The frenzy has extended far beyond conventional markets tracked by Wall Street firms. Bitcoin hurtled above $60,000 for the first time last month before pulling back. In the venture-capital world, investors are offering startups five times or more the amount of money they are requesting, Akane Otani and Michael Wursthorn report. \n\n  Americans are paying more to rent homes again, ending a stretch during the pandemic when they enjoyed flat or falling rental prices and widespread landlord concessions. Federal government stimulus payments and expanding payrolls are boosting savings, enabling building managers to lift rent prices on apartments and houses nationwide. A record-low inventory of homes for sale also leaves more people renting. Median asking rent rose 1.1% on an annual basis in March to $1,463 a month across the country's 50 largest markets, according to a report from Realtor.com. That marked the first month where the pace of rent growth had increased since last summer, Will Parker reports. \n\n   Balancing Act \n\n  The next big question for the Federal Reserve: how to signal its eventual tightening of the money spigot . The process of ending the Fed's giant bond-buying program, and subsequently raising interest rates, will take years unless inflation unexpectedly surges. Its first step down that road will be to start talking about it in the coming months or weeks-Chairman Jerome Powell's next big test with financial markets. This is delicate business for a central banker. The last time the Fed started telegraphing a reduction in its asset purchases, in 2013, it sparked a bond-market selloff known as the \"taper tantrum.\" Yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which directly affect long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, jumped half a percentage point in just one month, rattling Fed officials who worried they might undermine the recovery they had been trying to nurture, Paul Kiernan reports. \n\n  The Fed is expected to hold rates and bond purchases steady at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. \n\n   Covid Surges in India \n\n  India is in the grip of a Covid-19 surge that has hit with more speed and ferocity than any seen before in the more than yearlong coronavirus pandemic. It has overwhelmed New Delhi's chronically underfunded government hospitals and turned securing a private-hospital bed into a nearly impossible feat. India's surge came after loosening restrictions and public complacency set in, with highly contagious variants now spreading around the globe potentially serving as an accelerant. The outbreak threatens to extend the pandemic itself, driving world-wide numbers to new highs and creating an enormous viral pool that could become a breeding ground for new and potentially dangerous mutations, Vibhuti Agarwal, Shan Li and Suryatapa Bhattacharya report. \n\n   What Else We're Reading \n\n  Work from home surged during the Covid-19 pandemic. Will it stick? \"Our data say that 20% of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5% before. ... For most workers, the post-pandemic economy will entail more WFH than in the pre-Covid economy but considerably less than they would like. To put it another way, the benefits of a persistent shift to WFH will be broadly felt but flow mainly to the better educated and the highly paid,\" Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis write in a working paper for the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute . \n\n   About Us \n\n  Real Time Economics comes to you from WSJ economics reporters and editors around the world.

Despite recent pickups in hiring, spending and inflation, Fed officials are widely expected to maintain their policy stance when their policy meeting wraps up today. One source of uncertainty hanging over the meeting is a surge in demand for the Fed's usually moribund reverse repo facility. Meanwhile, major central banks have announced the coming end of a Fed facility that provided hundreds of billions of dollars in international swaps and prevented a dollar funding crisis.

More than $1 trillion was extended through it, split roughly equally over seven-day and three-month terms. At its peak, almost $450 billion was swapped, the lion's share to banks in Japan and the eurozone. The total has dropped to less than $1 billion. \n\n     U.S. Economy \n\n     Confidence in U.S. Economy Approaches Pre-Pandemic Level \n\n     U.S. consumer confidence rose sharply in April as more people got vaccinations, stimulus payments reached households and businesses more fully reopened, lifting the consumer confidence index to 121.7 from a revised 109.0 in March, The Conference Board said Tuesday.

The Federal Reserve said last week that it expected to slow the pace of its bond purchases before raising interest rates but hasn't said when it might begin a so-called taper. \n\n     The Bank of Canada said it would target a level of 3 billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $2.38 billion, in weekly bond purchases beginning the week of April 26. The central bank had maintained a weekly pace of at least C$4 billion in Government of Canada bond purchases since last fall. \n\n     Canada's central bank said it remained committed to keeping its policy interest rate at the effective lower bound, which officials have pegged at the current level of 0.25%, until economic slack is absorbed and its 2% inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on a strengthened economic outlook, that should happen during the second half of 2022, the bank said, earlier than a previous forecast of sometime in 2023. \n\n     \"There are brighter days ahead,\" Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said during a press conference. \"We think we are going to get back to a complete recovery sooner than we thought before.\" \n\n     Analysts said the central bank's communications on Wednesday showed more confidence in the economic recovery than they had anticipated, and several said they believe interest rates could rise from their current, ultralow level as early as the second half of next year. The Canadian dollar strengthened sharply against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday morning. \n\n     In a report that was released alongside the rate decision, the central bank said confidence in the economic recovery has improved, even as Covid-19 variants have led to renewed lockdowns in Canada and other countries. Growth in the first quarter of 2021 is expected to be 7% on an annualized basis, the central bank said, well ahead of an earlier estimate for a 2.5% contraction. In the second quarter, growth should moderate to 3.5%. \n\n     \"The Bank of Canada has made a drastic U-turn in the space of three months from being extremely cautious to being extremely upbeat,\" BMO Capital Markets strategist Benjamin Reitzes said. He said BMO would review its forecasts in light of the central bank's latest guidance. \n\n     Still, Mr. Macklem said during his press conference that absorbing economic slack and returning sustainably to 2% inflation may not be enough for the central bank to immediately raise its benchmark interest rate. \"What we do when those conditions are met, we will have to assess that at that time,\" Mr. Macklem said. \"There's nothing mechanical.\" \n\n     Canada is experiencing a third wave of Covid-19 infections that has prompted renewed economic restrictions in many parts of the country. The number of new reported Covid-19 cases in Canada surpassed those in the U.S. on a per capita basis earlier this month, and healthcare workers in some regions of Canada have warned they could be forced to ration care this spring if acute-care units continue to fill up. \n\n     The central bank said the impact of the pandemic's third wave is anticipated to be material but temporary, as the vaccine rollout continues and businesses and consumers adapt to virus-related restrictions. \n\n     Overall, the Bank of Canada anticipates economic growth of about 6.5% in 2021, higher than an earlier estimate for a 4% expansion. Growth is projected to come in at 3.7% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023. \n\n     Fiscal and monetary support, foreign demand and higher commodity prices should all boost economic growth this year, the central bank said. Canada's Liberal government issued a budget plan on Monday that includes C$100 billion in spending over a three-year period, which it said should help the country recover from the pandemic and fuel growth. \n\n     Write to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 21, 2021 14:36 ET (18:36 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258157Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T19:50:23.065343Z", "inner_id": 380, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5749, "annotations": [{"id": 6101, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "-SZoOhHnvz", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T20:06:04.400942Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T20:06:04.400967Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 940.5, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "754c1fe0-d4a3-4d4c-b6ce-3d57499d4004", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5749, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Nations Begin to Shape Post-Covid Economy Amid Diverging Fortunes\n\nBy Yuka Hayashi \n\n     WASHINGTON -- The world's top economic officials will meet virtually this week to steer the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Among their most pressing tasks: preventing lasting damage to the poorest and most vulnerable populations. \n\n     The global economy is rebounding faster than many economists projected, powered by growth in the U.S. and China and by the accelerating pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in many rich countries. Yet many low- and middle-income nations with limited financial resources are lagging behind. \n\n     \"Economic fortunes are diverging,\" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which will co-host the gathering along with the World Bank, said on Wednesday. \"Vaccines are not yet available to everyone and everywhere. Too many people continue to face job losses and rising poverty. Too many countries are falling behind.\" \n\n     Among the steps contemplated by finance ministers and central bankers: additional grants to low-income countries, debt reduction and a more equitable distribution of vaccines. \n\n     Gaining momentum, in particular, is a plan to use IMF reserve assets, known as special drawing rights or SDRs, to provide liquidity to struggling countries without adding to their debt burdens. The Biden administration officially started a process Thursday to allow the IMF to issue SDRs valued at $650 billion, reversing the opposition by the Trump administration last year. \n\n     In a report to be released on Tuesday, the IMF plans to raise its forecast for global growth for this year, from the 5.5% expansion projected in January, Ms. Georgieva said in her presentation Wednesday. That would follow an estimated 3.5% contraction in 2020, the worst peacetime outcome since the Great Depression. \n\n     The recovery in large part is a result of the roughly $16 trillion in fiscal stimulus and liquidity injections from governments and central banks, primarily in wealthy nations, the IMF said. The U.S. government alone has pledged roughly $5 trillion in stimulus spending since the pandemic began. \n\n     The IMF in January projected 5.1% growth this year in the U.S. China, which more quickly brought the pandemic under control to resume production and exports, was forecast to grow 8.1%. \n\n     But in emerging and developing countries, the Covid-19 crisis has reduced per-capita gross domestic product by one-fifth -- nearly twice the loss among advanced economies, the IMF estimates. Last year, more than 100 million people, mostly in South Asia, fell into extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. Globally, six million children could drop out of school this year, clouding their future prospects, the IMF says. \n\n     \"Rich governments have been able to approve trillions of dollars in stimulus packages for businesses, for cash transfers for people, vaccines, and for education, but what about lower- and middle-income countries?\" asked Nadia Daar, head of the Washington office of Oxfam International. \"The financial response the world has provided has just not been sufficient.\" \n\n     Money to aid poor nations has been limited as major economies focused on fighting the pandemic and repairing their own economies. The Group of 20 major economies has provided $5 billion in debt-service relief for more than 40 low-income nations, but private-sector lenders haven't joined the effort. The external debts of low-income countries more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, to more than $750 billion, according to the Institute of International Finance. \n\n     To tackle the problem without adding to that burden, the IMF has proposed issuing $650 billion in SDRs, which could be exchanged for dollars or other hard currencies to cover obligations. Critics say that is an inefficient way to help poor nations because most of the SDRs will be given to rich countries that are the largest IMF shareholders. Republican lawmakers in the U.S. also say the issuance could aid repressive regimes and state-sponsored terrorism. \n\n     In response to those objections, the U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday that advanced economies are pursuing ways to lend some of their SDRs to low-income countries. The Treasury also said the U.S. can refuse to swap dollars for SDRs of countries whose policies diverge from U.S. interests. \n\n     Concerns are also emerging over the possible negative effects of the massive stimulus spending by the U.S. and other wealthy nations on the developing world. Stimulus could stoke inflation, prompting central banks to raise interest rates, thereby boosting the debt burden for countries. \n\n     \"One big question, which is common to all economies, is how quick should the withdrawal of the stimulus be and what happens when they are withdrawn and whether you'll see an increase in bankruptcies,\" Odile Renaud-Basso, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said in an interview. She added that so far, the global economy has shown enormous resilience. \n\n     Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said he doesn't anticipate changing the central bank's easy monetary policy soon. Even so, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 1.72% late last week, up from 0.91% at the end of last year, on signs of an accelerating economic rebound, but it remains low by historical standards. \n\n     Rising U.S. yields have drawn capital away from emerging markets, putting downward pressure on their currencies while fueling both inflation and future inflation fears.

The shutdown is particularly worrisome for Southeastern states, including North and South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia; they have fewer sources of fuel than do states farther up the Atlantic Coast. \n\n     In the Raleigh, N.C., area on Tuesday, cars were lined up 30 deep to access a dozen pumps at a BJ's Wholesale Club. Lines three-cars long waited to fill up at a Sheetz convenience store near Raleigh-Durham International Airport, one of the rare stations around that still had fuel. \n\n     Shortages in the area were also afflicting gas-station owners like Mike Whalen, whose family owns three locations that were out of fuel on Tuesday. The vice president of finance for Whalen Corp. said he doesn't have alternative ways of getting gas or any sense for when his supply might be replenished. Plunging gasoline sales also mean fewer customers in the stations' stores buying drinks and snacks. \n\n     \"Am I losing money? Hell yeah I'm losing money,\" he said. \n\n     Gasoline demand Monday across the U.S. was up about 20% from a week earlier, according to data collected by price and fuel tracker GasBuddy. Across five Southeastern states -- Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia -- demand for gasoline jumped 40%, the figures showed. \n\n     Roughly 240 gas stations across Georgia, or 5.2% of the state's total, had run out of fuel by Tuesday afternoon, according to GasBuddy, which compiles the data when drivers report such outages. In Virginia, that figure was 7.6%. More than 7.5% of North Carolina gas stations were out of fuel and 2.9% of the total in South Carolina. \n\n     \"We're seeing a gas run,\" said Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis. \"Now we're going to see more dramatic [effects] as people run to the stations and run them dry.\" \n\n     Truck-stop operator Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores is \"experiencing low levels of diesel and gasoline intermittently\" at locations in South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, a spokeswoman said. The company is leaning on its fuel trading and hauling affiliates to deliver supplies across the region, she said. \n\n     Roger Homan, a caregiver, said he went to four stations in the Raleigh-Durham area Tuesday morning seeking to fill up a car for a client. He said he called the BJ's Wholesale Club where he typically gases up, and was told to hurry over. By the time he arrived 15 minutes later, there was no gas. \n\n     \"Every place I went, they had cones up so you couldn't fill up,\" Mr. Homan said. \n\n     Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said at a Tuesday press conference that Colonial could make a decision on restarting operations on Wednesday but cautioned that it would take a few days after that for the pipeline to be fully active. She urged consumers not to panic-buy fuel. \"Much as there was no cause for hoarding toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic, there is no cause for hoarding gas now,\" she said. \n\n     The disruptions come with the average U.S. price of regular unleaded gasoline already approaching $3 a gallon and a 6 1/2 -year high. Many Americans are expected to hit the road for Memorial Day weekend travel and summer vacations after receiving coronavirus vaccines, and higher pump prices could magnify pressure on millions of consumers who are already facing higher costs for everything from appliances to chicken. \n\n     The national average gasoline price Tuesday morning was up about 2 cents at $2.985 a gallon, according to AAA. In Georgia, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was up more than 11 cents from the previous day; and in North Carolina, it rose about 5 cents, AAA data showed. \n\n     The Southeast is particularly vulnerable because it has fewer refineries and pipelines to deliver fuel. It is also more difficult for the region to quickly import large quantities of gasoline from other countries. \n\n     Frank Barnhill, a 58-year-old marketing professional living near Myrtle Beach, S.C., said gas stations in the area had long lines and began running out of fuel Monday evening. He had filled up early in the day and only needed a little bit at night, but now plans to limit his driving moving forward. \n\n     \"There is high anxiety,\" he said. \n\n     The pipeline shutdown is also rippling through the aviation industry. Concerns about jet-fuel shortages have caused changes to two American Airlines Inc. long-haul flight routes out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a spokesman said. And Southwest Airlines Co. is bringing additional fuel to Nashville International Airport to supplement local supplies, according to a spokesman. \n\n     In Raleigh, John Bootsma got a text Monday night from his daughter telling he had better fuel up. \"Here close to our house [in Charlotte, N.C.] there is no more gas,\" the text read. He went to the nearest station around 10:45 p.m., but every tank was locked off. At the next station, he purchased $23 worth of gasoline, but he was the last person there able to do so. \n\n     \"It all shut down as soon as I put the nozzle back on the pump,\" said Mr. Bootsma, a 55-year-old who advises churches and pastors. \"The computer sign came up and said, 'This pump has stopped pumping.' The other pumps said the same thing.\" \n\n     State and national officials have taken steps to ease fuel shortages in recent days. On Tuesday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order temporarily suspending the state's gas tax and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also declared a state of emergency Monday because of the outage. \n\n     Also on Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency waiver to ease some requirements for reformulated gasoline in the next week for Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. The move came after the Biden administration issued an emergency waiver extending hours for truck drivers delivering fuel across 17 states, including several across the Southeast. \n\n     Ann Faircloth said she drove 200 miles from High Point in central North Carolina to Halifax in the state's northeastern corner as part of her volunteer ministerial work. She said she had found stations out of gas throughout her route when she stopped to top off her tank. She bought $30 at the Sheetz near the Raleigh-Durham Airport, which she said she hoped would be enough to get her home. \n\n     Ms. Faircloth, 69, said the squeeze is sending prices higher than she budgeted for at $2.75 a gallon. \"It's really high now and that's hard because I'm retired and on a fixed income.\" \n\n     Alison Sider and Jennifer Smith contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com, Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 11, 2021 16:10 ET (20:10 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258228Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:00:53.456181Z", "inner_id": 382, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5751, "annotations": [{"id": 6103, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "0s58_27qFA", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:01:45.094024Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:01:45.094049Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 50.894, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "81f3906e-18ab-4b6a-8b32-ed2b9a148f45", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5751, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Grocers, Restaurants to Suppliers: Hurry Up, Make More -- WSJ\n\nBy Jesse Newman, Jaewon Kang and Annie Gasparro \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (May 8, 2021). \n\n     Friction between food retailers and their suppliers is adding costs across the food chain. \n\n     Big buyers including Walmart Inc. and Sysco Corp. are fining suppliers over infractions like late or incomplete orders. Retailers excused such penalties for months during the pandemic when surging demand led to widespread shortages. \n\n     Meanwhile, many food makers and distributors say labor shortages, supply constraints and high freight costs are making it difficult to deliver complete, timely orders for goods from cake mix to ramen noodles. Similar tensions are mounting throughout the U.S. economy, as industries contend with shortages of supplies and complications of reopening businesses in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Prices for many foods, consumer products and other goods are rising as a result. \n\n     \"The supply-chain challenges are still there,\" said Henk Hartong, chief executive officer of Brynwood Partners, which owns Hometown Food Co., the maker of Pillsbury cake mixes and Buitoni pasta. He said wheat costs have soared and shipments for ingredients including vitamin C for Sunny D are running behind: \"It's not just one thing, it's everything.\" \n\n     Walmart told suppliers last fall that it would require orders to be 98% full and on time. Suppliers that didn't comply would be charged 3% of the cost of missing items, according to a September letter from the retail giant viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \n\n     \"We must improve product availability,\" Walmart's letter said. Spokeswoman Tara House said Walmart wants to save customers time and money by having the products they want online and in stores. \n\n     Food-distributor Sysco in February alerted suppliers to fees it would begin assessing in April for partial orders, billing discrepancies and missing data such as nutritional information, according to correspondence viewed by the Journal. Fees went into effect in April. Sysco also told suppliers it expects them to put its orders ahead of those from other customers. \n\n     \"We believe all our supplier partners subject to these policies have the capabilities to meet them,\" Sysco spokeswoman Shannon Mutschler said, adding that this will help restaurant customers as they reopen. \n\n     The shift in tone comes as companies are trying to get back to business as usual amid a reopening economy. Restaurants are adding back more seats in dining rooms, grocers are resuming service at salad and hot-food bars, and companies are bringing back more people to the office. \n\n     Retailers including Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons Cos. said they are struggling to secure some goods such as spices and cleaning products like detergent. Albertsons, which operates supermarket chains including Safeway and Jewel-Osco, has brought back fees in some categories, CEO Vivek Sankaran said. \n\n     \"It's about providing suppliers with better demand signals and making things simpler,\" Mr. Sankaran said. \n\n     While the fees are common among retailers, they are raising costs for suppliers on top of higher prices for fuel, transport, labor and some raw materials. Manufacturers are already raising prices for a range of food and other consumer products. \"Almost everything is going up,\" said Jagtar Nijjar, director of imports and commodities at distributor Gordon Food Service Inc. \n\n     Wise Pies is paying as much as $4,000 to ship a load of its pizzas, President Season Elliott said, compared with around $1,800 in August. Cheese prices have also almost doubled. Wise Pies is using more contractors to make and deliver some of its pizzas, which hurt profit but helped meet demand from distributors and retailers. The company hasn't raised prices. \n\n     \"We all want the same thing: to avoid out-of-stocks,\" Ms. Elliott said. \n\n     Thang Nguyen-Le, CEO of ramen-noodle brand Simply Food, said he is facing fines for delays and worries retailers could switch to competitors if he can't deliver. He is paying for refrigerated shipping containers and air shipments, though his products don't require either. \n\n     \"We've got to keep up shelf space even if it's at a loss,\" he said. \n\n     Utah-based distributor Nicholas and Co. was struggling to source milk and cream, so Nicole Mouskondis, the company's co-CEO, tried to arrange to buy milk from a dairy farmer with excess supplies. But a shortage of resin after winter storms closed chemical plants in the Southern U.S. left milk processors unable to procure the plastic jugs needed to bottle it. \n\n     \"There's a domino effect,\" said Ms. Mouskondis, whose company supplies restaurants including Subway and Panda Express. \n\n     Many restaurants haven't paid for some orders placed before the pandemic as they request more food to reopen. Distributors including Ms. Mouskondis have put some restaurants on payment plans. \"You can't repossess lettuce,\" she said. \n\n     Some restaurant chains have told distributors they could be fined for late deliveries, Ms. Mouskondis said, and some have replaced longtime suppliers with competitors that say they can procure the goods they need. \n\n     Suzanne Rajczi, CEO of New York-based distributor Ginsberg's Foods, said she is over-ordering many goods to improve her chances of having products her customers request. She is struggling to source blue cheese, for example, because cheese makers last year reduced inventories of varieties like Gorgonzola and Roquefort, which take months to age. \n\n     \"I can't make blue cheese any quicker,\" Ms. Rajczi said. \n\n     Write to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com, Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com and Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 08, 2021 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258262Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:01:45.311959Z", "inner_id": 383, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5752, "annotations": [{"id": 6104, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "JNysBIMdgP", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:02:48.474052Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:02:48.474070Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 62.401, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3bafebf1-5165-436b-9d91-c2c264fa6758", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5752, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Despite Lumber Boom, Few New Sawmills Coming\n\nBy Ryan Dezember \n\n     North America's sawmills can't keep up with demand, which has sent wood prices on a meteoric rise. Don't expect new mills to start popping up though. \n\n     Executives in the cyclical business of sawing logs into lumber said they are content to rake in cash while lumber prices are sky-high and aren't racing out to build new mills, which can cost hundreds of millions dollars and take two years to build from the ground up. \n\n     In doing so they are breaking with conventional wisdom in the commodities business, which states that the cure for high prices is high prices. Usually when prices for raw materials rise, refineries and smelters ramp up, farmers plant larger crops, wells are drilled, mines dug. New supplies flood into the market and prices retreat. \n\n     Home buyers and do-it-yourself-ers, who are paying more than four times the normal price for lumber, would like for that to happen. But they are flush thanks to historically low borrowing costs, rising home values and government stimulus. Demand has been unbowed by escalating prices. \n\n     Though lumber futures eased off last week's all-time highs, they remain more than twice the pre-pandemic record. Meanwhile, cash prices for framing lumber and structural panels reached new highs, according to pricing service Random Lengths. \n\n     Mill companies including Weyerhaeuser Co. and West Fraser Timber Co. have set nine-figure budgets to boost efficiency and output at their existing mills, particularly in the South where there is a glut of cheap pine timber. Some forest-products executives said they are considering acquisitions with their fast-accumulating cash. But there aren't many new mills on the drawing board for North America. \n\n     \"We are going to be ultra cautious on what we do in those regards,\" Canfor Corp. Chief Executive Don Kayne told investors last month when the company reported record quarterly profits. \"We don't mind at all having a little extra cash around for sure, considering what this industry goes through.\" \n\n     U.S. lumber-making capacity has risen about 11% over the past five years, according to Forest Economic Advisors LLC. New mills in the pine belt between Georgia and east Texas have helped offset closures that have shrunk Canada's capacity, but there isn't much coming behind them. Idled facilities are restarting in Florida and Mississippi. A couple small mills are under construction out West. Four bigger mills have been announced but not begun in the South, the firm said. \n\n     Chad Hesters, who advises forest-product executives and investors as managing partner in the Houston office of consulting firm Korn Ferry, said the lumber boom has prompted clients to ask about building mills. He said he tells them they are too late. \n\n     Besides the time and money it takes to build a modern mill, equipment, from microprocessors to heavy machinery, is in short supply. So are the sort of workers needed to operate a computerized mill, especially in the rural places where timber is abundant, Mr. Hesters said. \n\n     \"Trying to build capacity and make investments that have a lot of lead time at the top of a cycle is historically a good way to lose money,\" Mr. Hesters said. \n\n     U.S. wood-product manufacturing peaked in January 2006, according to the Federal Reserve. A sharp decline that year foreshadowed the housing market's collapse. The least efficient mills shut down while others were consolidated. Big Canadian sawyers West Fraser, Canfor and Interfor Corp. have spent billions of dollars modernizing mills in the Southern pinelands ever since. \n\n     An example is in Summerville, S.C., where Interfor is boosting output at a lumber mill that it bought in March from a cardboard maker. The lumber boom has pushed up asking prices for mills, though, which may impede deals like that, forest-product executives said. \n\n     Meanwhile, stock analysts are advocating for mill companies to return cash to shareholders. BMO Capital Markets analyst Mark Wilde said it is hard to see how mill companies can spend their windfalls without destroying value, given the frothy market. \n\n     \"It's a lot of sailors hitting the town with a lot of money in their pocket, so silly things can happen,\" he said on Canfor's earnings call. He applauded Interfor's move Wednesday to pay a special dividend of $1.65 a share. \n\n     Added shifts and new equipment should increase output on the margins, but mill executives expect supplies to remain tight and for prices to remain high into next year. \n\n     \"Even if there was an opportunity to build inventories, distribution channels would be reluctant at current market prices,\" said Bart Bender, Interfor's head of sales and marketing. \n\n     Companies that buy wood from mills to distribute to builders, manufacturers and retailers have been limiting orders to exactly what customers need for fear of getting stuck with high-price inventory and falling prices, said Michael Goodman, whose family owns and operates Sherwood Lumber Corp. \n\n     The Melville, N.Y., company annually sells about a billion board feet of framing lumber to truss manufacturers, building-supply companies and shipping-crate makers. The firm doesn't expect additional supplies before late next year or even 2023 and has been trying to manage its risk in the white-knuckle market by taking positions in the futures market. \n\n     \"This is our job,\" Mr. Goodman said. \"We're a middleman. We can't not have stuff on the shelf.\" \n\n     Write to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 17, 2021 05:30 ET (09:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258296Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:02:48.700346Z", "inner_id": 384, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5753, "annotations": [{"id": 6105, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "7a825kd2Ic", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:04:42.673198Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:04:42.673224Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-03T21:03:45.213417Z", "lead_time": 113.192, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5e449315-9506-44d2-bbf1-475494457e13", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5753, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Global Forex and Fixed Income Roundup: Market Talk\n\n   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income.

However, he wants to see a sustainable pickup in inflation before turning structurally bearish on bonds, he says. \"For me to turn structurally bearish on rates it would require an outlook with a sustainable pickup in inflation dynamics--also shared among households and corporates and not 'just' markets,\" he says. To actually pull inflation higher a tight labor market, including sizeable wage increases, is also required, he says.

(emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0721 GMT - U.S. consumer spending was strong at the end of the first quarter and sets the tone for a summer boom, says Gregory Daco chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. As health conditions improve and the economy reopens, generous fiscal stimulus, rebounding employment, and rising optimism will help unleash pent-up demand, he says. Oxford Economics projects real consumption growth of 9.6% for this year, which would mark the strongest performance since 1946, and 5.1% for 2022. While the outlook is on the high side of consensus expectations, risks are still tilted to the upside, he says. \"Should consumers spend 45% of their excess savings over the next 18 months, in line with the marginal propensity to spend out of income, real GDP could be 2.5% higher than in our baseline in 2022,\" Daco says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) \n\n  0718 GMT - With the start of the 2021 travel season in Europe on the horizon, a rebound in travel prices is expected to boost inflation later in the year, Goldman Sachs says. As both demand and the timing of 2021's tourism season are highly uncertain, Goldman Sachs has constructed three scenarios. In its baseline, travel prices recover somewhat this year, with travel price inflation reaching about 5% year-on-year in autumn. An upside scenario in which travel prices reach levels seen during the strong 2018 tourism season would add 10 basis points to eurozone core inflation in September. A downside scenario where this year's season is comparable to the 2020 season would take around 20 basis points off core inflation in autumn, Goldman Sachs says.

Speculation that the Fed could scale back stimulus will grow if U.S. inflation continues to accelerate above expectations, she says. The dollar initially rose after data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices jumped 4.2% year-on-year in April before correcting lower then ending the day higher. The DXY dollar index last falls 0.1% to 90.6470 and EUR/USD rises 0.2% to 1.2099.

The survey found an association between vaccine hesitancy and social-media use, particularly when social media is the main source of information, Eurofound says. The intention to get vaccinated varies considerably among member states, with an east-west divide. With the exceptions of Austria and France, the intention to get vaccinated is over 60% for all western member states, while among eastern states the rate is lower, ranging from 59% in Romania to 33% in Bulgaria, the survey shows.

Supply constraints threaten to slow countries' plans to reduce emissions and make them more expensive, they say. \n\n     Though off their highs, many mined commodities have hit record prices this year as the global economy bounces back from Covid-19, governments increase spending on infrastructure and supply stutters for some resources. For instance, the price of copper -- used in construction and to conduct electricity -- has almost doubled over the past 12 months to a record of $10,762 a metric ton earlier this month. \n\n     But miners have been reluctant to invest in new projects, analysts and executives say, because their investors have in recent years wanted higher dividends after seeing the sector burn through cash during the last commodity bull run. That hesitancy is now raising the specter of supply crunches. \n\n     \"We are starting to see some pinch points appear in the key energy-transition metals, copper and platinum group metals for example, where there is very little new supply ready to fill the gap,\" says Anglo American PLC Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pearce. \n\n     \"You have to continuously reinvest to keep filling your resources cupboard, and it takes many years to bring new mines to fruition,\" he adds. London-listed Anglo has been among the bigger spenders on new and existing projects in recent years. \n\n     Overall, though, spending across the industry isn't keeping pace with demand and is expected to lead to shortfalls for many resources, analysts say. Capital spending is set to fall by 6% among major diversified mining companies and 10% among copper miners this year, according to analysts' consensus. \n\n     Meanwhile, the total demand for copper is forecast to increase 40% by 2030 -- with so-called green demand jumping by as much as 900% -- according to Goldman Sachs Group, leaving a supply shortfall of 8.2 million metric tons. Even as copper prices have rallied over the past 12 months, no material new mines have been approved, it added. \n\n     At current metal prices, Rio Tinto PLC, BHP Group Ltd., Anglo American and Glencore PLC could this year generate a combined $140 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Royal Bank of Canada. That compares with $44 billion in 2015, a year when metals prices were at or near lows. \n\n     To be sure, there has been investment in some areas of mining, particularly in the iron ore market. But miners' focus has been on returning cash to investors. \n\n     Capital expenditure, including money spent on current and future production, rose 30% to $75 billion last year among 45 of the world's largest miners, according to investment bank Liberum, while dividends nearly doubled to $66.1 billion. The capital spend was a third lower than in 2012, at the end of the last commodity bull run, while dividends were 125% higher, Liberum says. \n\n     Miners are returning more money to investors, analysts and executives say, after overspending on projects and acquisitions during that last run, which lasted for a decade. Investors then deserted the sector, some miners went bankrupt, and many chief executives lost their jobs. \n\n     \"Investors remain very conscious the last bear cycle was driven by an overbuild of new capacity,\" says Robert Crayfourd, who invests in miners at London-based fund CQS New City Investment Managers. \"The point is here, that maybe they are being too cautious.\" \n\n     Some miners admit there isn't enough cash being spent on new projects. \n\n     \"Our industry's capital discipline and decline in exploration success over a number of years means there are fewer high-quality growth projects in the industry pipeline to meet this demand,\" BHP's Chief Executive Mike Henry told an industry conference last week. \n\n     Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow has recently complained that investor clamor for dividends means the industry isn't replacing what is being mined. \n\n     While analysts expect miners to start investing more in new projects if commodity prices remain elevated, mines typically take 10 to 15 years to develop. That has prompted some analysts and executives to worry that shortfalls could hurt governments' attempts to drive down carbon emissions. \n\n     To achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, there needs to be a quadrupling of the supply of minerals needed for clean-energy technologies by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. The Biden administration this year rejoined the accord, which calls for cutting emissions enough to limit the rise in global temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. \n\n     \"The data shows a looming mismatch between the world's strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of critical minerals that are essential to realizing those ambitions,\" Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, said in a report last month. \n\n     For instance, the Paris-based energy watchdog says expected supply from existing mines and projects under construction is estimated to meet only half of projected lithium and cobalt requirements by 2030. Both metals are key components of batteries for electric cars and energy storage. \n\n     \"This will likely mean that decarbonization could cost more than is currently estimated and will be a structurally inflationary force for some time,\" says Tyler Broda, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada. \n\n     Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 25, 2021 07:00 ET (11:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258367Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:05:25.568531Z", "inner_id": 386, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5755, "annotations": [{"id": 6107, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "cvUzzRFiXK", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:06:13.285093Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:06:13.285130Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 46.956, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "e647e85b-14fc-4db3-aee9-c933db13d302", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5755, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Cheap Dollars Attract Foreign Investors to Treasurys -- WSJ\n\nBy Anna Hirtenstein \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 12, 2021). \n\n     The cheapest dollars in years are spurring a rise in foreign investment in U.S. government bonds at the same time that pension funds are boosting their holdings -- and that demand pickup could weigh on Treasury rates even as the economy strengthens. \n\n     The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, is down 2.4% this quarter so far and hovering close to the lowest level in about five months. The price of hedging dollars through forward rates also was the cheapest in at least six years last week and remains close by, according to analysis from Deutsche Bank. \n\n     \"If I were to buy a bond market, which is the case for a lot of investors, I would buy the U.S. Treasury,\" said Laurent Crosnier, chief investment officer of Amundi's London branch, Europe's largest asset manager. The positive yield and low hedging cost \"makes the U.S. Treasury attractive relative to others.\" \n\n     The benchmark 10-year government bond yield slipped below 1.5% earlier this past week, closing at 1.462% on Friday -- near its lowest level since March 3. Prices rise when yields fall. \n\n     Government bonds are popular in times of poorer economic performance for safety and liquidity. The recovery from the pandemic is widely expected to result in fund managers cutting their holdings as they position their portfolios for better times and less uncertainty. \n\n     Investors are widely expecting an increase in inflation from a combination of pent-up demand, supply constraints and stimulus spending. This is also seen as negative for conventional bonds, whose fixed cash flows lose purchasing power when prices rise. \n\n     Despite this, recent Treasury bond auctions have seen an uptick in demand from foreign investors. A 5-year debt sale on May 26 received the most bids from overseas investors since August at over 64%. A 7-year issuance in the same week saw the most since January. The latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed that major foreign investors upped their holdings of longer-maturity U.S. government bonds in March. \n\n     The dollar depreciation is linked to the high levels of liquidity in the market from a combination of Federal Reserve stimulus and colossal fiscal spending from the White House, analysts said. \n\n     Cash holdings have ballooned during Covid-19 lockdowns, with deposits at commercial banks in the U.S. sitting at a record $17.1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Assets in money-market funds total $4.6 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute, which is close to record levels. \n\n     U.S. money-market yields have come under pressure from the excess liquidity, with some pushed toward zero. \n\n     Forward rates, which are used to lock in an exchange rate at a certain point in the future and reduce the risk of currency fluctuations, are priced based on money-market rates and the difference between yields in the two currencies' domestic short-term debt markets. The smaller the gap, the cheaper the trade -- and that is just what has happened as the U.S. rates have come down. \n\n     \"If you take a 10-year U.S. Treasury and you hedge with a three-month forward, the yield you get is around 0.9%,\" said Althea Spinozzi, a fixed-income strategist at Saxo Bank. \n\n     That is higher than all European government bonds of the same maturity. Italy's 10-year bond yield was 0.693% on Friday. Japan's equivalent bond yielded 0.030%. \n\n     To be sure, many analysts are expecting Treasury yields to tick up as U.S. economic growth and inflation pick up. The median of 47 estimates projects that the benchmark 10-year government bond yield will reach 1.90% by the end of the year, according to data from FactSet. \n\n     \"That means that if you were to act on that trade now, that second selloff could wipe out the carry returns you were hoping to make,\" said Ralf Preusser, a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America. \n\n     \"We think the selloff in dollar rates will be slower and more gradual once we hit 2% for the 10-year. That is where we expect this to start kicking in, with flows from European and Japanese investors,\" he said. \n\n     Another source of money flowing into Treasurys has been pension funds. Strong rallies in riskier assets, like stocks, in recent months helped to close the shortfall many funds have between the value of their assets and their liabilities, allowing them to move cash into safer assets, like bonds. \n\n     U.S. pension funds shifted nearly $90 billion of funds out of stocks and into fixed income during the first quarter of this year, $41 billion of which went into Treasurys, according to analysts at Bank of America. \n\n     These flows have helped to hold down yields, but Mike Bell, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said he expects 10-year yields to rise to about 2% over the next 12 months -- and that level would lure even more investment flows. \n\n     \"The rise in yields from there will be a lot slower and Treasurys will be much more attractive,\" he said. \n\n     Paul J.

My plan at work has long been to stick with suits and dress shoes -- a strategically nondescript and immediately forgettable mix of Brooks Brothers and Allen Edmonds -- for a set-in-his-ways look I can ride out for another decade or two. \n\n     For weekends, I feel that my wardrobe still holds up. It includes L.L. Bean golf shirts and New Balance sneakers, an aging-dad power combo best accessorized with groaning loudly while easing into patio furniture. But the pandemic has left me less sure about the suits. \n\n     For more than a year, professionals have been wearing fleece below the Zoom line, and in some cases above it. An unspoken consensus seems to be forming around urban workers returning en masse to their offices around Labor Day. Suppose I go back in a suit, and I'm the only one? I'll stand out like a Times Square street performer, and with no disrespect to handsy Elmo or the underpants cowboy, that's not what I'm going for. Then again, what if I dress down only to learn that everyone else has pent-up demand for dressing up? \n\n     Also, my suit pants resist buttoning at the moment, but let's not get sidetracked with logistics. \n\n     J.P. Morgan expects U.S. apparel revenue to jump 21% this year from last year's depressed level, and to come in 6% above the more normal revenue seen in 2019. A recent Jefferies survey of women shows that more than 60% say that their wardrobes are out of style and they plan to do more shopping soon. \n\n     Apparel has been a deflationary good for decades, but in May, prices were up 5.6% from a year ago, topping the overall inflation rate. Covid-19 has claimed thousands of clothing stores, leaving survivors with more pricing power. Supply-chain jam-ups have raised shipping costs. Yarn-spinners and other textile players are short on workers. Demand is surging. \n\n     I'm starting to worry about a nationwide run on pants come August. But I don't want shoppers to panic -- at least not before I've had a chance to place my orders. Whatever happens, the apparel industry is poised for a stretch of solid profitability. \n\n     Among mass merchants, J.P. Morgan recommends shares of Target (ticker: TGT), which stands to benefit from fewer rival stores. Among brand owners, it likes Nike (NKE), V.F. Corp. ( VFC), and Levi Strauss (LEVI). Its picks for specialty stores include American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT), and Gap (GPS). Even once we get beyond \"RTO,\" as Wall Street is calling our return-to-office moment, inventories could remain lean going into the critical Christmas season. \n\n     Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ike Boruchow says investors should be careful to distinguish between thriving stores and attractively priced stocks. For example, he is impressed with Lululemon Athletica (LULU), the mainstay for ladies' yoga tights that's making a play for men. \"Full disclosure, I was wearing a lot of Lululemon to work prepandemic,\" says Boruchow, who highlights the company's stretchy, $128 ABC jeans and Commission chinos. \"You throw that on with a casual button-down shirt, and that's kind of the new look of what used to be a suit and tie.\" But he cut his rating on the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight a year ago. \n\n     Boruchow likes shares of Ralph Lauren (RL), which was hit hard by the pandemic and therefore has much to gain from a return to normal shopping patterns. And he's bullish on ThredUp (TDUP), which collects and resells used clothing. \n\n     Don't forget accessories. Boruchow says the sharp acceleration toward online shopping during the pandemic leaves handbag sellers Tapestry (TPR) and Capri Holdings (CPRI) well positioned. Clothing sellers would generally prefer that shoppers do business in stores, where fixed costs are high and need to be covered, rather than online, where the cost of order fulfillment is largely variable. But handbags are an exception. Prices are high enough to absorb shipping costs, and return levels are low because sizing isn't an issue. \n\n     I spoke this past week with the chiefs of two relatively young clothiers. Sarah LaFleur runs M.M. LaFleur, which sells women's clothing and specializes in a look she calls power casual. Think chic but also stretchy, and machine washable. The impetus came from tech workers. \"Their male counterparts, they might be wearing hoodies and jeans,\" she says. \"But that's not what women are wearing. Yet, if we wear a dress to work, other people think that we're interviewing.\" Her top tip for the first day back to work: Wear a size that fits, and be kind to yourself. \"It's a fraught time for everyone,\" she says. \n\n     Stitch Fix (SFIX) uses human stylists and artificial intelligence to select fashions for customers. Shares fetch $60, up from a November 2017 initial-public-offering price of $15, which makes the company more than half as valuable as Gap. \n\n     \"Consumers are looking for more guidance and more advice right now,\" says Stitch Fix President Elizabeth Spaulding, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1. Fierce growth in athleisure wear during the pandemic has given way to surges in \"fun, going-out clothes of summer\" -- jumpsuits, rompers, and midi skirts, she says. For me, Spaulding recommended an in-house brand of stretch-knit blazer called Artefact. \n\n     Speaking of artifacts, back to my suits. I knew time was not on their side, of course, long before Brooks Brothers and Men's Wearhouse filed for bankruptcy protection last year. There was that time I visited the chief of a big bank in his office several years ago, and he told me I looked too corporate. Among chat-room momentum traders, \"suits\" has become a put-down. Now, I fear we're headed toward seeing suits only on special occasions: weddings, burials, Mark Zuckerberg scoldings by Congress. \n\n     I guess now I'll face harder decisions than whether to wear charcoal or navy with one of my eight identical dress shirts. Unless all you suits out there want to make a last stand for starch come Labor Day. \n\n     Write to Jack Hough at jack.hough@barrons.com.

Base effects in energy prices continue to push up headline inflation and Rory Fennessy, assistant economist at Oxford Economics, expects this trend to continue. \"Overall, we expect inflation this year to be largely driven by transitory factors, and although core price pressures will pick up, these will continue to remain largely subdued,\" the economist says.(maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0941 GMT - Singapore shares ended higher, supported by bank and consumer-product stocks.

Firstly, the building-and-insulation materials company's completion of the credit facility confirms its credentials as an extremely strong financial structure with plenty of opportunities, the Irish research firm says. Secondly, it shows that Kingspan is committed to dealing with the many environmental challenges facing the world, Davy says. \"Linking both is a willingness to be measured on the targets that have been embedded in its Planet Passionate strategy via the pricing of the new facility,\" the firm says. Davy retains its outperform rating. Shares are down 1.1% at 77.28 pence.

Orders also might be particularly high now because businesses have learned of supply shortages and are panic buying in response, Tombs says. The upswing in manufacturing is set to run out of steam soon and by the end of the year output is expected to fall back, he says.

The adjusted unemployment rate was at 6.0% in May, unchanged from April, and Koehler-Geib says unemployment will fall noticeably and the number of people on short-time contracts will drop sharply by summer. However, for the labor market and for the economy as a whole to make a sustained recovery, she says vaccinations are essential. \"If hotels, restaurants, stationary retailers and cultural and sports venues open their doors again across Germany, consumption will pick up,\" she says, explaining that this surge in consumption would be \"a turbo igniter for the economy.\" (maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0928 GMT - Japanese regional banks will likely struggle to restore profitability to pre-pandemic levels due to a subdued economic recovery and ultralow interest rates, Moody's says. About half of the country's listed regional banks reported drops in net income or net losses for the fiscal year ended March, the ratings company says. The average nonperforming loan ratio of 12 rated regional banks rose 15 basis points as of the end of March from a year earlier, Moody's says, adding it expects NPL ratios to rise further and loan loss provisions to stay elevated because default rates among businesses will rise amid a weak recovery. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka) \n\n  0927 GMT - Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' indexes show a picture of robust operating conditions midway through the second quarter, Claus Vistesen, senior eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says. \"Output growth slowed slightly, but remains robust overall, and the near-term outlook is positive due to brisk growth in sales and new orders,\" the economist says. However, the supply side is not that positive. Firms' purchasing activity is now at a record high and delivery times have soared in response, he says. \"Not surprisingly, input price inflation is rising sharply, forcing firms to respond in kind, by raising output charges,\" Vistesen says. On the positive side, employment seems to be in a solid uptrend and the outlook for the next 12 months is brightening, he says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0923 GMT - The index of German blue-chip companies - the DAX 30 - currently trading at 15,606, is escaping from a symmetrical triangle pattern in place since May 25th high. Prices are supported by the rising 20/50-simple moving averages on a 60-minute chart. Bollinger are widening, indicating that a new up leg may be on the cards. As long as 15,350 (May 27th low) is support, the bias remains bullish. Expect a further rise towards 15,671 and 15,730 in extension. Alternatively, a push below 15,350 would call for a reversal down trend with 15,100 as main target.

Countries on both sides of the Atlantic have received authorization from the World Trade Organization to slap a total of $12 billion of retaliatory tariffs on each other, but a four-month suspension was agreed in March. It will now be extended for five years. \n\n     This was always a war without winners. By cementing Boeing's dominance and then allowing for Airbus' rise, government aid has helped make the commercial-jet industry more competitive, not less. With the aviation industry in tatters because of the pandemic and many carriers having been bailed out by the public sector, keeping this legal feud alive was dangerous for all parties involved. \n\n     Negotiations have also been pushed along by the Biden administration's more conciliatory stance toward trade relative to former President Trump. Even before the U.S. election last November, however, there were signs that officials were poised to reach a deal. There was a crucial factor driving it: China. \n\n     The Asian giant is determined to follow in Airbus' footsteps, with state-owned aerospace manufacturer Comac taking center stage in the government's \"Made in China 2025\" strategy. Comac has developed a narrow-body jet called the C919, which is scheduled to enter service later this year as a direct competitor to the powerhouse Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families. China has also partnered with Russia to build a wide-body aircraft, the C929, that could take on long-haul routes. An aerospace alliance between these two countries could become a real threat in the long run. \n\n     For now, China still needs time. The C919 is inferior to the A320neo and 737 MAX in every respect: It has less range, burns more fuel and, crucially, doesn't have an international support network that makes it marketable abroad. Furthermore, China isn't yet self-sufficient in the most complex parts of the aerospace supply chain: The C919 will start by using engines made by General Electric and Safran. This gives the West a geopolitical pressure point. \n\n     For investors, though, the prospect of Boeing and Airbus losing market share in the huge and faster-growing domestic Chinese market is reason enough for concern. As a recent analysis by Barclays pointed out, China's jet orders are very low compared with how many it will need. That in part looks like a way to put pressure on the U.S.; Beijing still hasn't recertified the MAX. But A320 orders also are abnormally low, which may reflect hopes that the C919 can fill part of the gap. \n\n     It is thus in U.S. and European interests to cease mutual hostilities and present a unified legal front. The C919 development, while benefiting some Western suppliers, almost certainly contravened WTO rules too. Given that China can instruct its state-owned airlines to buy as many homemade planes as necessary at the desired prices, a key source of concern should be government procurement, and what counts as such. \n\n     Historically, government intervention has served to create challengers that have made the aerospace industry more competitive. China has the scale necessary to repeat the cycle. While the end of a pointless and expensive legal battle is a welcome development for investors, it also highlights the seriousness of the long-term threat Boeing and Airbus face. \n\n     Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 16, 2021 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258504Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:08:51.747021Z", "inner_id": 390, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5759, "annotations": [{"id": 6111, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "HlXrrGbJze", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:10:29.496070Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:10:29.496095Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 97.003, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a39e9d7d-b269-4982-981e-1049446c0318", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5759, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "EUROPEAN MIDDAY BRIEFING: Stocks Eye Fresh -2-\n\n  Clariant will reinvest in the business for a 20% stake, allowing it \"to further benefit from the improving profitability of the pigments business resulting from the initiated efficiency program,\" the company said.

Fifty-nine lawmakers voted against his coalition and one abstained. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Ousted From Power, Israel's Netanyahu Plots Comeback \n\n  TEL AVIV-Outmaneuvered by rival politicians after 12 years in power, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already plotting a comeback, intending to challenge the new government on matters that could deeply divide the cross-party coalition. \n\n  Mr. Netanyahu, who now is expected to lead the opposition, plans to press the new governing coalition, which includes eight parties ranging from an Arab group to conservative forces, on sensitive policy issues such as settlement construction and empowering the country's Arabs. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Biden and Macron Share Affection and Worldview at G-7 Summit \n\n  President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron threw their arms around each other as they walked on the beach. Later the two men shared a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate as aides looked on. At one point Mr. Biden asked Mr. Macron to answer a reporter's question for him. \n\n  At the summit of the Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall this weekend, the two presidents embraced each other, sometimes literally, as allies on a host of issues-from multilateralism to fighting climate change-after years of volatility between Mr. Macron and former President Donald Trump. \n\n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n\n  GLOBAL NEWS \n\n  Investors Bet Green-Energy Focus Will Push Up Oil Prices \n\n  Some investors are wagering that Wall Street's preference for green energy will depress spending on oil extraction, setting the stage for supply shortages and higher fuel prices. \n\n  The bets come as money managers line up trillions of dollars for wind, solar and other renewable programs and expenditures on oil projects tumble. The drop in fossil-fuel spending is becoming so severe that energy companies could struggle to quench the world's thirst for oil, some analysts say. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Fed Officials Could Pencil In Earlier Rate Increase at Meeting \n\n  WASHINGTON-Federal Reserve officials could signal this week that they anticipate raising interest rates sooner than previously expected following a spate of high inflation readings. \n\n  In March, the last time they released quarterly economic forecasts, most officials expected to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate near zero through 2023 to encourage the economy's recovery from the pandemic. Officials are set to release updated projections Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  G-7 Leaders Rally to Biden's Call to Challenge China \n\n  CARBIS BAY, England-Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies called on China to respect human rights but stopped short of an outright condemnation of Beijing, as President Biden sought to build momentum for an international coalition to counter Chinese influence in the world. \n\n  A 25-page joint statement released by leaders of the G-7 nations on Sunday-covering issues ranging from pandemic recovery to the global economy, tax, trade and girls' education-asked China \"to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.\" The same section of the statement said the G-7 would continue to consult on how to challenge China's behavior in the global economy. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Economy Week Ahead: The Fed, Factories and Consumers \n\n  The Federal Reserve's policy meeting highlights this week's slate of economic news. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Markets Are Leaving Little Room for the Fed to Be Wrong on Inflation \n\n  Investors have faith in the Fed. Over the past three months consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy, have risen 2%, equivalent to a shockingly high annual rate of 8.2%. Rather than panic and dump bonds, investors have piled into Treasurys and pushed 10-year yields back down to where they stood in late February. Confidence in the central bank is absolute. \n\n  To be fair, the Fed is probably right: This burst of inflation is probably transitory. The reopening of the economy released a surge of pent-up demand, while supply bottlenecks are restricting production and distribution. As things get back to normal inflation should calm down. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Regulators Tell Banks It Is Time to Stop Using Libor \n\n  Regulators are ramping up efforts to end Libor trades by year-end. \n\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week told brokers that facilitate derivatives trading among large banks that they should stop using Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, as a reference rate by July 26. The Tuesday announcement could accelerate the push to phase out the troubled interest-rate benchmark, which underpins trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts. Authorities decided several years ago, after a widespread Libor-rigging scandal, that it should disappear by the end of 2021. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.S. Fight Against Chinese 5G Efforts Shifts From Threats to Incentives \n\n  The U.S. government is ratcheting up pressure on Beijing's 5G ambitions overseas, offering financial incentives and other enticements to countries willing to shun Chinese-made telecom gear. \n\n  U.S. foreign-affairs agencies are developing workshops and a handbook that would help policy makers in places like Central and Eastern Europe, and in developing countries elsewhere, to build next-generation 5G cellular networks that don't use equipment from Huawei Technologies Co. and China's ZTE Corp. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Write to sarka.halas@wsj.com \n\n  Write to us at newsletters@dowjones.com \n\n  We offer an enhanced version of this briefing that is optimized for viewing on mobile devices and sent directly to your email inbox.

Germany will launch new, October 2026-dated Bobl at an auction Wednesday. UniCredit calculates the fair value for the yield of the new Bobl at -0.57%, around three basis points higher than that of the April 2026 Bobl, the current five-year German benchmark. The new Bobl will be launched with a EUR5 billion offer volume. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0751 GMT - Copper prices rise after strong U.S. jobs data Friday boosted investors' confidence in the economy's rebound. Three-month copper on the LME gains 1.5% to $9,516.50 a metric ton. The employment report showed the U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs in June, significantly more than economists had been forecasting. The data \"showed more jobs being created, but not at a speed that would...prompt action from the Federal Reserve to taper, thus capping the dollar,\" said Anna Stablum at brokerage Marex. Concerns that strong economic data and rising inflation could prompt the central bank to withdraw its stimulus measures have been a primary concern among inventors since the Fed's meeting last month. (william.horner@wsj.com) \n\n  0732 GMT - EUR/USD last trades flat at 1.1858 but could drop below $1.1800 later this week when U.S. Federal Reserve minutes are released, likely stressing the risk of future monetary tightening, ING says. \"It is hard to put the Fed tightening genie back in the bottle now,\" it says. Falls in the euro may be limited, however, if official eurozone economic data confirm the improvement suggested by recent surveys. \"The best hope for EUR/USD now is that better activity data does indeed come through, raising expectations that the [European Central Bank] does have to taper in September and securing a floor for EUR/USD at 1.1700,\" ING says. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com) \n\n  0731 GMT - The Spanish service sector gathered further momentum in June, hitting its highest growth rate since March 2000, amid the continued easing of virus-related restrictions and the reopening of facilities previously closed due to the pandemic. The services PMI compiled by IHS Markit came in at 62.5 in June, up from 59.4 in May and well above the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction. Respondents to the survey reported a sharp uplift in demand, particularly in the hospitality and transport services sectors, the report says. If challenges related to the arrival of tourists from key markets can be resolved, the country will be on course for even stronger economic growth in the coming months, Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit, says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) \n\n  0717 GMT - Sterling may show little reaction to an expected announcement on the full easing of England's coronavirus measures, ING says. \"There will be much focus this week on what the U.K. government says about fully opening up the economy on July 19--although as the Bank of England admits, this final stage of the re-opening will have little impact on activity,\" ING analysts say. Given a quiet start to the week on the U.K. news front, EUR/GBP is likely to trade in a range of 0.8565 to 0.8615, they say. EUR/GBP is last flat at 0.8571. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0658 GMT - The dollar is likely to remain firm until upcoming economic data confirm the Federal Reserve's view that recent inflationary pressures will prove temporary, Commerzbank says. \"Quite some time is likely to pass until it is time to generally question the current moderate USD strength,\" Commerzbank currency analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann says. \"It will have to become clear that not much will be left of the current surge in inflation so that the Fed will not suddenly have to get active.\" For now the outlook on inflation remains uncertain, he says. The DXY dollar index and EUR/USD are flat at 92.2480 and 1.1866 respectively. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0654 GMT - Natixis expects the first phase of the European Central Bank's tapering of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme to be a reduction of weekly purchases in the fourth quarter back to the levels seen at the beginning of the year. This would imply weekly purchases of EUR13.9 billion versus EUR18.1 billion since the March monetary policy meeting at which the ECB decided to carry out PEPP purchases at a significantly higher pace. Natixis calculates that there will be EUR350 billion left from the PEPP's EUR1.85 trillion envelope going into 2022. \"It will be quite a challenge to use all of this by the end of 1Q 2022,\" says strategist Jean-Christophe Machado. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0653 GMT - SGD ticks higher versus USD as Fed tapering concerns abate following mixed U.S. jobs data. While American employers added a better-than-expected 850,000 jobs in June, the unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the consensus estimate of 5.6%. The June unemployment rate reading could provide support for the view that the Fed will remain accommodative for longer, which would be a drag on USD, Maybank says. On technical charts, the currency pair's initial support is at 1.3450 and its initial resistance is at 1.3530, Maybank says. USD/SGD is down 0.1% at 1.3462. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com) \n\n  0649 GMT - Natixis has a modest bearish bias for U.S. dollar and euro government bonds, it says, remaining bullish about risky assets for the second half of the year. Specifically, it is overweight equities versus bonds and versus credit. Natixis also likes emerging-market assets, although it is aware of the vulnerability of emerging markets to tapering risks. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0625 GMT - German Bunds should remain supported amid signs for a renewed bid for euro-duration given fears over rising Covid-19 Delta variant cases, Commerzbank says. \"The constructive market backdrop looks set to extend near term,\" Commerzbank's rates strategist Rainer Guntermann says. He expects Bunds and spreads to remain on firmer footing as this week's government bond supply is set to be relatively low, while the European Central Bank continues its asset purchases. The 10-year Bund yield is trading 0.6 basis points higher at -0.229%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0616 GMT - Societe Generale recommends investors stay long in eurozone periphery government bonds versus the core. While capital gains might be gone for now in these trades, carry should allow Italian and Spanish government bonds to outperform, it says. A carry trade involves borrowing at a low interest rate and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return. In the inflation-linked segment, SocGen recommends reducing allocation to U.S. inflation-linked bonds, or TIPS, to neutral, attributable to volatility which makes these assets less appealing. SocGen remains long in European inflation-linked bonds. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0616 GMT - As the EU continues to build its benchmark curve, Societe Generale finds good value in the five- and 30-year segments. The bank likes to be long in the EU's 30-year bonds versus France and Germany, while the five-year maturity could continue to \"richen\"--to become more expensive--, including against swap, it says. The EU's next issuance under the Next Generation EU program could be a seven- or a 15-year bond before the summer break, SocGen says. The next issuance will be the third one after a debut 10-year bond, and five- and 30-year bonds in the second transaction.

Market expectations were for a 3.2% rise in June, according to economists at TD Securities. \n\n  On a month-over-month basis, prices climbed 0.3% in June. On a seasonally adjusted basis, CPI rose 0.1% in June from the previous month. \n\n  Excluding gasoline, headline inflation rose by 2.2% on an annual basis in June, the data agency said. \n\n  Meanwhile, the average of the Bank of Canada's preferred measures for underlying inflation in June was 2.23%. Core inflation is meant to gauge price changes in items that exclude volatile goods like food and energy. \n\n  Several economists said the June deceleration should ease concerns about the possibility of a persistent rise in headline inflation. The Bank of Canada said earlier this month that the factors pushing up inflation are largely temporary, such as a rebound in gasoline prices and supply-chain bottlenecks. Officials at the central bank expect inflation to remain above 3% through the second half of 2021 before easing back toward 2% in 2022. \n\n  \"While the headline rate is still well above the Bank of Canada's 2% target, the deceleration appears to confirm the central bank's view that much of the recent pickup in inflation was transitory,\" CIBC Capital Markets economist Royce Mendes said. \n\n  The June data used Statistics Canada's recently revised weights in calculating the consumer-price index, reflecting changes in spending patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic by putting more weight on shelter and household furnishings, and less on transportation. The data agency said the headline number for annual inflation wasn't affected by the new weightings. \n\n  Statistics Canada said the deceleration in June was largely the result of price increases that took place one year earlier, at a time when the economy was reopening after the initial shutdown that began in March 2020 and was meant to curb the spread of Covid-19. Annual inflation data compare current prices with those from a year earlier. \n\n  In June, shelter prices rose 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and transportation prices increased 5.6%. Price growth slowed the most in the clothing and footwear category, advancing just 1.1% year-over-year, mainly because of lower prices for women's clothing. Gasoline prices also advanced at a slower annual pace in June compared with the previous month. \n\n  Write to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 28, 2021 09:50 ET (13:50 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258651Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:16:19.311346Z", "inner_id": 394, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5763, "annotations": [{"id": 6115, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "-EgTO-duxA", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:17:13.205871Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:17:13.205895Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 53.173, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "0854768e-2d46-445c-828a-f86485019acb", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5763, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "FDA Lets Pharmacies Substitute Branded Insulin With Knockoff Product, in First for a Biologic Drug\n\nBy Joseph Walker \n\n     For the first time, U.S. regulators have said that a knockoff version of a biologic drug is interchangeable with its branded equivalent, a milestone in the yearslong effort to bring greater competition to the market for expensive biologic drugs. \n\n     The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said the biosimilar insulin product Semglee is interchangeable with Sanofi SA's Lantus, a designation that allows pharmacists to automatically substitute Semglee for prescriptions for Lantus, one of the top-selling insulins in the world. \n\n     Semglee is made by Viatris Inc. and Biocon Biologics Ltd. and was first approved by the FDA last year. But doctors would have to specifically prescribe the biosimilar version, rather than allowing pharmacists to substitute it for Lantus when filling the prescription. The companies said they would launch the product with new labeling on interchangeability before the end of the year. \n\n     A Viatris spokeswoman declined to disclose how much the company will charge for the interchangeable Semglee product. \n\n     The current list price for a pack of five Lantus injection pens is $425.31, a Sanofi spokeswoman said. When Semglee was originally introduced last year, the companies charged $147.98 per five-pen package. \n\n     A majority of patients pay $0 or $10 per prescription for Sanofi insulins through the company's copay assistance program, the spokeswoman said. For uninsured patients, the company has a program that allows patients to pay a fixed price of $99 a month. \n\n     Insulin, a lifesaving medication used to control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes, became a flashpoint in recent years in the debate over rising drug prices. The cost of insulin led some patients, particularly those without health insurance or coverage requiring significant out-of-pocket payments, to ration or skip doses of the medication. \n\n     In 2010, Congress created a mechanism for drugmakers to develop biosimilar copies of so-called biologic drugs -- made from living cells -- that had lost patent protection. The aim was to create more competition and bring down prices in the same way that generics had for traditional pharmaceuticals made from chemicals. \n\n     But the biosimilar market hasn't delivered as much cost-savings as policy analysts had hoped, partly because there haven't been any approved biosimilars designated as interchangeable by the FDA. \n\n     \"This is a momentous day for people who rely daily on insulin for treatment of diabetes, as biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar products have the potential to greatly reduce healthcare costs,\" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. \n\n     Lantus had second-quarter sales of 637 million euros, equivalent to about $757 million, down 2.7% from the same quarter a year ago, in part because of biosimilar competition. In the U.S., sales rose 6.6% to 237 million euros, or about $282 million, over the same period. \n\n     The FDA's approval of Semglee as interchangeable is an important step to creating competition and affordable insulin, but there is still a long way to go, said David Mitchell, founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs, a lobbying and advocacy group. \n\n     \"Semglee offers an alternative for only a fraction of the diabetes community -- we need competition from interchangeable, less expensive options for all modern forms of insulin,\" Mr. Mitchell said in a statement. \n\n     The interchangeability designation for Semglee may not have as much of an impact on the insulin market as the FDA hopes, said Bernstein & Co. analyst Ronny Gal. There are already several long-acting insulin products on the market that doctors and patients view as equivalent, and drugmakers have created ways to bring down patient copays in recent years amid scrutiny from lawmakers and the media, Mr. Gal said. \n\n     Pharmacists typically only substitute cheaper drugs when a patient's insurance encourages them to do so, said Mr. Gal. In the case of insulin, insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers have kept tight control of which products patients receive because they can obtain larger rebates and discounts by guaranteeing their market share to particular products, he said. \n\n     But the FDA's first approval of an interchangeable product is a positive signal that the agency is willing to grant the designation to future biosimilars where insurers may be willing to allow for substitution, said Mr. Gal. \n\n     \"It's important looking forward to other markets where interchangeability is more important,\" said Mr. Gal. \"In the context of insulin, it is a minor market development.\" \n\n     Write to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 29, 2021 16:06 ET (20:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258683Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:17:13.435690Z", "inner_id": 395, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5764, "annotations": [{"id": 6116, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "4Fbpq2N-JZ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:19:43.869019Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:19:43.869033Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 149.684, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a634de76-aafe-411b-a804-3aeaa509ef1c", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5764, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Glynn&apos;s Take: Economic Case for Reopening Australia to the World Is Getting Louder\n\n \n   By James Glynn \n \n\n  SYDNEY--The economic case for reopening Australia's international border to skilled workers is gaining increasing momentum, but as lockdowns keep shuttering major cities, the politically prickly issue might not be acted upon with any vigor until after the next federal election that is due within the next year. \n\n  That sets the stage for a potential clash of wills between the businesses that are eager to cash in on the stunning economic recovery over the last year, and the federal and state governments wanting to avoid the backlash that will surely come if the pandemic is given a fresh wind. \n\n  One figure that is emerging as a torch bearer for starting to open the border is Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Philip Lowe, who warned Thursday that investment and productivity could suffer if businesses are unable to start tapping the international job market for skilled workers soon. \n\n  Ironically, it is also Mr. Lowe who is leading the charge for higher wages and inflation in Australia, something that a closed international border could help deliver much faster. It's just that the head of the central bank doesn't want higher wages and inflation to come at the cost of lost investment opportunities, as frustrated businesses scratch in the dirt for skilled employees. \n\n  \"If borders remain completely closed and we can't get workers into the country that are needed for firms to expand and invest, I think we will see more wages growth. Some people might think that's a good thing, but on the other hand, we will see less investment,\" he told a conference of economists. \n\n  Mr. Lowe described the border closure as a \"first-order\" issue for policy makers, noting that there has been a sharp jump in job vacancies--especially in the accommodation and food-services sector--while the labor pool needed to meet demand has cratered. \n\n  While some of these vacancies could have been filled by people on visas, this has become more difficult. Since March 2020, the number of people in Australia on a visa with the right to work has dropped by more than 250,000, he said. \n\n  Mr. Lowe said that if the international border remains closed for an extended period \"pressure points\" could build within the economy. \n\n  Closing the country's doors to contain the spread of the pandemic has proven to be largely effective and politically popular. So throwing them back open could prove disastrous for sitting governments, especially if more contagious variants of the virus are unleashed. Such an event would be political death for any government, whether state, federal, conservative or progressive. \n\n  There are many thousands of Australian citizens overseas that can't return home as they wish due to government-mandated intake quotas. Australia has also been sluggish in rolling out vaccines, making the border issue even more acute. \n\n  The country can do some things in the interim to ease the pressure on its job market, such as giving more work hours to those who want them, while increased flexibility via measures such as working from home might boost participation. \n\n  But an aging population poses an obstacle, and, more immediately, so does the reality that skills mismatches will inevitably become common. \n\n  While there is no plan to put out the welcome mat for foreign workers, there is some probing of what might be done to start normalizing things. The federal government said recently that it plans to experiment with shorter isolation periods for vaccinated travelers and the gradual return of foreign students to help two of the most affected industries, education and tourism. \n\n  But some health experts worry that the government's push to nudge the door open wider is premature as Australia has only fully vaccinated around 6% of its population and the Delta variant is spreading in ways that scientists don't yet fully understand. Increased risks from the Delta variant have already prompted a 50% cut to the number of people allowed to arrive in Australia on commercial flights. \n\n  What is certain is that the intensifying debate over the international border will shape much of Australia's immediate political and economic outlook. \n\n \n\n  Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 08, 2021 03:58 ET (07:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258714Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:19:44.102455Z", "inner_id": 396, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5765, "annotations": [{"id": 6117, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "Vjzf7mv1mQ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:20:38.210895Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:20:38.210931Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-03T21:20:37.948073Z", "lead_time": 53.396, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "69505081-6a2f-486d-8f0d-fd833f7d6bf9", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5765, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Costs Weigh Down Wind-Turbine Makers -- WSJ\n\nBy Jennifer Hiller and Katherine Blunt \n\n     The world's appetite for green energy is greater than ever, but that isn't translating into big profits for some of the companies behind the boom. \n\n     Top wind-turbine makers are struggling with lower earnings as rising raw- material costs, problems shipping the hulking machines, and uncertainty over the future of U.S. subsidies pressure their businesses. \n\n     Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA and Vestas Wind Systems A/S, two of the largest global manufacturers, reduced profit forecasts for the remainder of the year. General Electric Co., another leading turbine manufacturer, reported year-over-year growth in turbine sales but hasn't turned a profit in that segment this year. \n\n     Globally, wind production has been growing as the renewable energy source becomes more economically competitive with fossil fuel sources of electricity such as coal and natural gas and as countries begin taking steps to address the causes of climate change. \n\n     Demand for turbines this decade is expected to be roughly double demand in the previous 10 years, according to estimates from the consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. But companies face an array of challenges in manufacturing and moving the increasingly large turbines, whose blades alone span more than 100 feet apiece. \n\n     A quadrupling of transportation costs and increases in steel, copper, aluminum and carbon fiber prices will likely drive wind-turbine prices up by 10% over the next 12 to 18 months, according to Wood Mackenzie. \n\n     \"There is a logistics challenge in major harbors in the world due to Covid lockdowns,\" said Vestas Chief Executive Henrik Andersen. \"You have a very high number of container ships and specially designed ships transporting our finished assets. They are held in queues. They can't get access to the harborside.\" \n\n     Prices for the raw materials used in wind turbines started moving higher in mid-2020 as many pandemic restrictions eased globally, and those elevated costs are likely to last, Mr. Andersen said. But the transportation-price increases should eventually drop, he added, saying Vestas expects them to last through the start of 2022. Vestas shares have fallen around 15% this year. \n\n     Higher oil prices this year have boosted the cost of the fuels used to move wind-turbine supplies and equipment. At the same time, the turbines are getting larger and more complex to transport, said David Sale, chief executive of Goldwind Americas, the North American subsidiary of Chinese turbine maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. \n\n     \"As we continue to push the boundaries of transportation, the specialized equipment that's required to move these machines is not abundant,\" Mr. Sale said. \n\n     Another major factor weighing on turbine makers is a lack of clarity on whether and how the Biden administration will extend a federal tax credit for wind development in the U.S., a key growth market. The extension of the tax credit, set to expire this year, is being considered as part of a $3.5 trillion budget-reconciliation bill that proposes a number of spending measures to accelerate renewable-energy deployment. \n\n     With the details of U.S. subsidies in flux, some customers are unsure of whether to order new turbines now or wait to see if policies and potentially lower shipping costs make the purchases more attractive in the near future, analysts and companies said. \n\n     Abby Watson, Siemens Gamesa's head of government affairs in North America, said she is optimistic that the industry will have a clearer long-term picture of U.S. policy by the end of the year. That, she said, would help the company better plan its manufacturing strategy without having to ramp up and down in response to tax-code changes. \n\n     \"When we talk about price pressures that everyone has been dealing with, a not-insignificant part of that is inconsistency in policy,\" she said. \n\n     Siemens Gamesa, whose shares have fallen roughly 25% this year, said it is charging higher prices and taking other measures to offset the increase in raw-material costs. Though the company warned that the challenges will likely continue in the near term, it forecasts strong growth in coming years as governments around the world set carbon-reduction targets. \n\n     General Electric said that it expects the U.S. onshore-wind market to decline in the near term before stabilizing, in part because a potential long-term extension of wind-tax credits could cause wind-farm developers to push out their investment decisions for years. \n\n     In a statement, the company said it sees long-term growth in the global wind industry as the technology becomes more competitive with other forms of power generation and as governments in the U.S. and elsewhere work to address climate change. \n\n     For now, turbine manufacturers largely must swallow higher logistics costs, said Deepa Venkateswaran, senior renewables analyst at Bernstein Research. Fixed-price contracts typically include a margin for inflation, she said, but it wasn't enough of a cushion this time. \n\n     \"The bottlenecks cannot be immediately passed on,\" Ms. Venkateswaran said. \n\n     Write to Jennifer Hiller at jennifer.hiller@wsj.com and Katherine Blunt at Katherine.Blunt@wsj.com \n\n     Corrections & Amplifications Chinese wind turbine maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.'s investors include state-owned power entities, but it has no controlling owner.

Don&apos;t Expect House Prices to Get Cheaper. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Simon Constable \n\n     The lumber bubble is over. Prices likely will stay rangebound for the foreseeable future as supply increases and demand from home builders remains robust. \n\n     \"We expect prices to hover between $500 and $600 per 1,000 board feet,\" says Samuel Burman, a commodities economist at independent research firm Capital Economics. \n\n     Lumber futures have been on a roller-coaster ride because restricted wood supplies from sawmills met with increased demand for the material to construct homes. That combination sent prices for random-length lumber futures contracts on the CME to all-time highs around $1,671 in May, up from $495 in late October. They were fetching $530 recently. \n\n     Now that the bubble has popped, the market will likely stabilize, neither rallying nor falling substantially. \"We think the market is at the right level now,\" says Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors. Investors might want to step aside from taking a directional bet on prices over the next few months. \n\n     Alternatively, risk-tolerant traders might consider an options straddle strategy that would take advantage of a static market. For instance, try selling a November-dated call option that would pay out if the November-dated futures contract price rises above $605, and a put option that pays out if the price falls below $405. If the price remains within the $405-to-$650 range until the option expires, then investors keep the option sale price, recently around $7,601. \n\n     It's the interaction of increased supplies and continued solid demand that will help keep prices in a range. Last year lumber supplies were tight due to the pandemic restrictions. That's quickly reversing because even after the recent crash, wood prices are high compared with the past decade, when they mostly remained below $400. \n\n     \"The lumber mills are still making really good money, so they won't shut down supply,\" Hackett says. It's likely that sawmill operators will increase supply and take advantage of falling unemployment benefits to hire more workers. \n\n     Separately, demand for housing remains high relative to available homes. The past decade of low housing construction has led to a housing shortage. Single-family housing starts should average around 1.2 million next year, up from one million this year, according to forecasts from Capital Economics. That compares favorably to the annual rate of less than a million throughout the period from August 2007 to November 2019, according to government data. \"We expect demand for new homes to remain strong,\" Burman says. \n\n     There are risks with this trade. A potential supply disruption is coming from Canada after a U.S. government report recommended raising tariffs on Canadian lumber to 18% from 9%, alleging the Canadian forestry industry benefits from government subsidies. \n\n     The likelihood of such a move is probably dependent on prices falling significantly from current levels down to less than $250, which would be below the past decade's average price, Burman says. \"If prices are relatively high, there is no need to prop up the southern states,\" he says. \n\n     Poor weather could also cause home-construction delays. \"It is easier to build when it is sunny and dry; when it's wet, there are delays,\" Burman says. \n\n     However, the largest risk is in selling options. If prices of lumber futures fail to remain within the $405-to-$650 range, traders could lose more money than the sale price of the options. For that reason, be prepared to exit the trade quickly if the economic outlook changes. \n\n     Still, given the likely prevailing economic scenario over the next few weeks, the probable rewards seem worth the risks. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 11, 2021 16:47 ET (20:47 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258778Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:21:43.863942Z", "inner_id": 398, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5767, "annotations": [{"id": 6119, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "5UndOE7RCz", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:21:49.975549Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:22:36.594882Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 46.588, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5924867e-d87f-409b-93e3-82fe21aa6b07", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5767, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Market Talk Roundup: BOE Leaves Policy Unchanged\n\n  The Bank of England voted unanimously to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.1% and voted 7-1 to maintaining the BOE's government bond-buying target at 875 billion pounds, with one member prefering to stop puchases immediately.

What It Means for Stocks and the Economy. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Al Root \n\n     Semiconductors might be the new oil -- and that could make the 2020s the new 1970s. \n\n     Back then, the world ran on oil -- and any change in supply had a massive impact on demand. When OPEC embargoed the U.S. in the 1970s, the price of crude rose from about $3 a barrel at the beginning of the decade to $13 a barrel by its end. The U.S. even issued gas ration coupons in 1974. \n\n     The spike was good news for Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which returned roughly 100% and 70%, respectively, in the 1970s, but painful for everyone else, as inflation raged. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 17% and 5%, respectively, over the decade. \n\n     If oil was the necessary component for the 1970s economy, chips provide the same function in the 2020s. They power everything from our computers and phones to our cars and appliances. And, as everyone knows by now, there is a shortage, with delivery times growing to more than 20 weeks, per Susquehanna Financial Group data. \n\n     Roughly 80% of all the chips in the world are made in Northeast Asia. Politicians realize how big a problem this is, and they have started to demand local manufacturing, with President Joe Biden introducing a plan for $50 billion in chip research earlier this year. Reshoring any industry, including semiconductors, is a yearslong process that requires billions in capital. There will be winners and losers. And if it goes on too long, it will filter into the prices of all kinds of goods. \n\n     \"Shortages related to rapid upswings in demand could become inflationary, \" TS Lombard's Rory Green and Steven Blitz wrote back in January, when the scarcity of chips -- \"a product more known for steadily declining prices\" -- was in its infancy. \n\n     The global semiconductor shortage has been a particular thorn in the side of the automotive industry all year. It was supposed to resolve itself by the second half of 2021. But more production cuts announced by Toyota Motor (TM) this past week shows the problem isn't going away soon. In fact, RBC analyst Joseph Spak argues the shortage could last for years. \n\n     Part of the problem is structural, Spak says. Electric vehicles need more computing power, but the auto industry typically relies on older-generation chip technology, where capacity isn't being as readily added by chip makers. Instead, they prefer to focus on newer, higher-end chips for the consumer electronics industry. \n\n     The result: Instead of lines at the gas stations, there are lines at the automotive dealerships. Low new- and used-car inventories have pushed up pricing and contributed to rising inflation. Used-car prices rose about 20% in the first half of 2021, while new-car prices rose about 3%. The rise in used-car prices has started to slow, but new-car price gains are accelerating, rising about 7% year over year in July. \n\n     That's not good for consumers, but auto makers stand to benefit. Constrained production will lead to persistently low inventories and higher pricing. Companies will sell fewer cars, but that's been offset by higher prices. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) shares are up 43% and 17%, respectively, in 2021, and both still trade for about seven times 2022 earnings. \n\n     And that's just the auto industry. The longer the chip shortage goes on, the more prices will rise in all types of products. That will benefit chip makers such as Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Wall Street sees upside in the latter. Some two-thirds of analysts covering the stock rate it Buy, and the average price target implies about a 33% upside. \n\n     Don't expect long lines outside RadioShack, but expect the chip shortage to be felt just the same. \n\n     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 20, 2021 21:18 ET (01:18 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258876Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:24:18.517551Z", "inner_id": 401, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5770, "annotations": [{"id": 6122, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "s6xngnbqTd", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:41:28.668167Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:41:28.668192Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 66.424, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "c0646408-7f6e-40ef-96d6-8ed63cdbdc9e", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5770, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Transcript: Fed Chief Powell&apos;s Postmeeting Press -2-\n\n     So the question is really on the maximum-employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate, 50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress. Many on the committee feel that the substantial further progress test for employment has been met. Others feel that it's close. They want to see a little more progress. There's a range of perspectives. \n\n     I guess my own view would be that the test, the substantial further progress test for employment, is all but met. And so once we've met those two tests, once the committee decides that they've met, and that could come as soon as the next meeting -- that's the purpose of that language is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting -- the committee will consider that test and we'll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper. \n\n     Q: Thanks, Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. \n\n     So looking at the steps, we have now, basically, four years of inflation above target and policy never gets to the long-run rate. I'm wondering if you could address that from two perspectives, one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year, and second, from the perspective of the average household that's now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when for some this year real wages have actually gone down. \n\n     MR. POWELL: Sure. So as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the out years and that's really, I think, a reflection of -- and they've moved up significantly for this year -- and that's, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being -- that we're seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. \n\n     So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation is going to be higher this year and a number -- you know, I guess, the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up but just by a couple of tenths. \n\n     Those are very modest overshoots. You're looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years -- two years and three years out. These are very, very -- I don't think that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot. That just happens to be people's forecasts. You know, we want to -- we want to foster a strong labor market and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we're very much on track to achieve those things. \n\n     In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want and we're -- that's really the ultimate test of whether we're getting this done under the framework and, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent. I wouldn't put -- I wouldn't put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and '24 -- one-tenth in '24. But you're right, those are the numbers. \n\n     Q: Chair Powell -- thank you, Michelle. \n\n     Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I'm wondering what the contours of that debate have been. For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase? Or is it about financial stability risks or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? \n\n     Thank you. \n\n     MR. POWELL: So let me say that there's very broad support on the committee for this plan both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote today, and I'd say quite, quite broad support for this approach. You're correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner and they've made their arguments publicly. For some of them, it's a financial stability concern and for others it's other concerns. They can make their own -- make their own arguments. \n\n     This is -- this is an approach that the committee will, broadly, support and it will -- it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate. You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the -- in the early stages of the crisis, they were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets. \n\n     Then as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do, and now we're in a situation where they still have a use but it's time for us to begin to taper them. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework -- the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go and, again, broad support on the committee. \n\n     Q: Hi, Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal. \n\n     Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just to taper, may be closer at hand. Does the committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you've articulated, or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do? \n\n     MR. POWELL: Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper, and the taper takes some months in everyone's figuring, so you're going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it is -- it's what we adopted last September. It's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, and while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market's very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market and we think that those imbalances will sort themselves out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve moderately higher inflation, over 2 percent -- you know, that really depends on the path of inflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff. \n\n     So I just think -- if you look at what people are writing down for year and 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates, and that's only one indicator but it suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they're writing down, in good faith, what they see as meeting the test. There's a range of perspectives about where the economy will be. But, by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023, so it's not really an unusually wide array of views about this. \n\n     Q: Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year, and I wonder if you thought those were appropriate. \n\n     MR. POWELL: So no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. \n\n     So let me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission, and that's why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business. One of those is -- sort of three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictions: one is ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that's bank securities and other things; secondly, there are times when we're not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets, and that's the period immediately before or during an FOMC meeting; and third, there's regular disclosure. \n\n     So all of these -- everyone's, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis, so, you know, I would have to go back and read people's financial disclosures to know what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you'd say it's served us well. The other thing you would say -- that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public's trust in us. We need to make changes and we're going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review. We're going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards. \n\n     Q: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n\n     I want to follow up on Jeanna's question. The issue of ownership of these stocks and trades, do you think it's appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying? Is that one of the modifications that you're looking at? And in that these -- you said yourself they're clearly not seen as appropriate. In that the Fed's code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of conflict, do those trades, in fact, and holdings violate the Fed's code of conduct? Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might be done with your review? Thank you, sir. \n\n     MR. POWELL: Don't have a timeline yet. We can start with that. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 22, 2021 16:56 ET (20:56 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258916Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:41:28.889349Z", "inner_id": 402, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5771, "annotations": [{"id": 6123, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "YWCDIrWHWB", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:42:20.525912Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:42:20.525933Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 50.925, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "c0ba0491-0a07-4c7a-b4b0-b257a139e9cf", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5771, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "An Inexpensive Builder Stock In a Hot Market -- Barron&apos;s\n\n  Taylor Morrison Home trails its peers, but rising prices and fatter margins make it a value play \n\nBy Daren Fonda \n\n     Buyers looking for a new house may need to throw their name in a hat and hope to win the lottery. Taylor Morrison Home , a builder based in Arizona, is holding drawings for purchases in hot markets like Austin, Texas, and Phoenix. Prime home lots are selling for $50,000 premiums in auctions. \"We're in a very strong market,\" says Taylor CEO Sheryl Palmer. \n\n     Home-builder stocks are up 37% this year, reflecting dizzying demand, ultralow mortgage rates, and maddening construction delays. Just 34,000 completed new homes were on the market in July, well below the 87,300 average for the month since 1973. Bidding wars have broken out, including camp-outs where buyers set up umbrellas and barbecues on the sidewalk, waiting to be first in line for a new house, says BTIG analyst Carl Reichardt. \n\n     If there's still a value play, it may be Taylor Morrison's own stock (ticker: TMHC). It's up just 10% this year and has gained less than half the 97% industry average over the past three years. Taylor trades around book value, compared with 1.8 times book for the industry. At a recent price of $28, it goes for 4.3 times estimated 2022 earnings, a 30% discount to peers. \n\n     The discount looks excessive. While Taylor isn't the most profitable builder, it's taking measures to lift returns. The company has pledged to boost gross margins on home-sale closings, from 20% in 2021 to 22% next year, and it's aiming for a 20% return on equity, up from the high teens now. Taylor is streamlining floor plans to cut construction costs. And the company controls 76,000 lots, including raw land and plots under development. It plans for nearly 400 communities with houses for sale by year-end 2022, up from 330 in 2021. \n\n     \"The stock is inexpensive,\" says Reichardt, who sees it hitting $38 over the next year. \"It's a call option on the company improving efficiencies and margins. The market doesn't believe Taylor will do that, but there's a large margin of safety in the stock.\" \n\n     The country's No. 5 builder, Taylor focuses on West Coast and Sunbelt markets, many with healthy population growth. Under Palmer, CEO since 2007, Taylor has bought five builders over the past seven years, including AV Homes in 2018 and William Lyon Homes in 2020. The acquisitions have expanded Taylor's geographic reach and product line to include entry-level, move-up, and \"active adult\" homes -- typically in age-restricted developments for people over 55. \n\n     Taylor's average closing price hit $503,000 in the June quarter, up from $458,000 last year. Houses that sold in the quarter for future delivery are averaging $597,000. Its order backlog has been growing, reaching 10,228 in June. \n\n     Palmer says demand has cooled from a \"frenzied\" spring, but she's still expecting healthy sales throughout the year. The biggest obstacle now: finding labor and materials. Lumber prices remain elevated, despite dropping sharply from the spring. Lead times for windows have more than doubled, she says, and everything from garage doors to flooring is arriving later than usual. \"It's like playing double-fisted Whac-A-Mole, \" she says of the sourcing effort. \n\n     Taylor aims to close 14,500 to 15,000 homes this year, up 18% from 2020. Growth is likely to slow next year to 1%, according to consensus estimates, and Taylor's backlog of signed house contracts is expected to fall slightly. But with prices on the rise, and Taylor working to lift margins, profits should rise. Consensus analyst estimates have Taylor earning $5.13 a share this year and $6.60 in 2022. \n\n     Why does the stock look so cheap? Investors worry that the industry's fuel -- low rates, big job gains, and a shift to the exurbs -- won't last. Escalating prices are pressuring affordability and may push out first-time buyers. \n\n     For Taylor, investors may be leery of more acquisitions. Builders often overpay and then take accounting hits on inflated land values, says Reichardt. Palmer says \"synergies\" from the Lyon deal should start to materialize over the next few months and that she has \"no plans\" for acquisitions. \n\n     Investors may also be skeptical of Taylor's margin targets. The builder doesn't dominate any local market or product niche, says Reichardt, who calls it a \"tweener,\" lacking the purchasing power of larger builders. \"A lot of margin improvement is driven by depth of local market share,\" he says. \"They don't have that.\" Palmer says that Taylor is a top-five builder in many markets and she has \"tremendous confidence\" about hitting the 22% target. \n\n     Investors aren't paying much to give her the benefit of the doubt. Alex Barron, an independent analyst and head of the Housing Research Center, estimates that Taylor's book value will rise from $27 to $31 over the next year. Strip out $5 a share in goodwill, or intangible assets, and it would be worth $26 in a liquidation, he says, pegging the stock at $45 in a bull case. \"The upside/downside is very compelling compared to other builders,\" he says. \n\n     Wedbush Securities' Jay McCanless likes the margin story and sees earnings reaching $6.58 a share in 2022. Even if the stock achieves a peer multiple of six times his earnings-per-share forecast, it would trade at $39, below his $46 target. \"The earnings potential and pricing power are there,\" he says. If he's right, investors may have a winning lottery ticket, too. \n\n     Write to Daren Fonda at daren.fonda@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 03, 2021 21:30 ET (01:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.258949Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:42:20.749466Z", "inner_id": 403, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5772, "annotations": [{"id": 6124, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "MDY5F68vrI", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:42:32.458454Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:42:32.458479Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 11.039, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "80b6c1aa-442d-44bf-9f1b-acf3045192a5", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5772, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Malaysian PM Cash Market Prices for Palm Oil - Sept 2\n\n \n\n  The following are prices for Malaysian palm oil in the cash market at 1000 GMT Thursday, supplied by commodity broker Matthes & Porton Bhd. \n\n  Prices are quoted in U.S. dollars a metric ton, except for crude palm oil and palm kernel oil, which are in ringgit a ton.

Saefong \n\n     Natural-gas prices reached their highest levels in more than seven years thanks to a slow recovery in Gulf of Mexico production after an August hurricane, and strong U.S. exports and tight supplies. \n\n     A global effort to limit carbon emissions has meant more demand for natural gas and renewable energy, says Troy Vincent, market analyst at commodity market data provider DTN. \n\n     Recent weakness in wind generation in Europe, coupled with low natural gas inventory ahead of winter, has caused natural gas and electricity prices \"across the continent to shoot to record highs,\" he says. That follows months of high temperatures in East Asia and delays in bringing nuclear generation back online in Japan. \n\n     Surging demand in Europe, Asia and Latin America for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has led to record high U.S. exports this year, helping push U.S. natural gas futures to their highest since February 2014, he says. \n\n     Front-month natural-gas futures settled at $5.46 per million British thermal units on Sept. 15, the highest since February 2014. Prices have more than doubled for the year, trading 115% higher year to date. \n\n     The record pace of U.S. LNG exports this year shows just how tight the global natural-gas market is, and \"how fearful Eastern Asian and European nations are of running short of supply this winter amid heating season,\" Vincent says. \n\n     In 2020, U.S. natural gas exports reached a record high, according to the Energy Information Administration. Exports may increase by 20% to 25% this year, says Bryan Benoit, national managing partner, energy, at Grant Thornton. \n\n     Meanwhile, warm 2021 summer months resulted in a more significant increase in demand and the price of natural gas, he says. There's also a need to replenish inventories to prepare for the winter heating season. \n\n     Working gas in U.S. storage, the amount available to the marketplace, has fallen to its lowest level for this time of year since 2018. As of the week ended Sept. 3, working gas in storage stood at 2.9 trillion cubic feet, well below both a year ago and the five-year average. \n\n     U.S. inventories may peak in October at around 3.4 trillion cubic feet, which would still be about 10% below the prior five-year average for the period, says Vincent. \n\n     Extreme weather remains an issue with over two months left in an Atlantic hurricane season that's already disrupted Gulf energy operations. \n\n     Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29. As of Sept. 15, 39% of the region's natural-gas production remained offline, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. \n\n     Steve Craig, chief energy analyst at Elliott Wave International, refers to events like Ida as \"exogenous\" -- outside factors that can have a temporary impact on price that's \"irrelevant to the larger price trend.\" \n\n     Based on technical analysis known as the Elliott Wave Principle, Craig says the \"big picture\" outlook for natural-gas futures is for significantly higher prices. \n\n     In spite of some periods of downward consolidation and changes in weather, he says he'll remain \"big-picture bullish\" until the price wave pattern \"dictates a change,\" as it did in July 2020, when prices traded above $1.896, triggering Elliott Wave International's forecast for a rally that could take prices to $4.929. \n\n     Vincent, however, says that while global demand will remain strong heading into winter -- drawing more LNG shipments from the U.S. and leading to smaller-than-normal seasonal inventory builds -- natural-gas prices may fall from current highs if there's a shift to coal and fuel oil. \n\n     Prices will still likely hold above $4, however, before easing lower amid rising production next spring, he says. \n\n     Email: editors@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 17, 2021 21:30 ET (01:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.259038Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:46:26.881068Z", "inner_id": 406, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5775, "annotations": [{"id": 6127, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "EKH3BNoFdy", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:46:56.289056Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:46:56.289082Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 28.682, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "27fb294c-e26a-4d32-804a-8f239af127d2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5775, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Retail Sales Rise, Showing Resilient U.S. Consumers -- 3rd Update\n\nBy David Harrison \n\n     Americans stepped up their spending in September, a sign of resilient demand and rising inflation as consumers head into the holiday shopping season. \n\n     Sales at retail stores, restaurants and online sellers rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. The rise in sales reflects persistently strong demand and higher consumer prices. \n\n     Consumers, armed with stimulus payments and rising wages, have stepped up spending this year, shrugging off the Delta variant of Covid-19, the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and emerging supply constraints. The retail sales, which aren't adjusted for inflation, rose 13.9% in September from a year earlier. Consumer inflation increased 5.4% in that time, according to the Labor Department. \n\n     Still, economists see some reasons for concern in the months ahead, including supply chain disruptions causing backlogs and pushing up prices further, a slowing labor market recovery and anxious consumers. \n\n     \"The shipping bottlenecks will become more of an issue in November and December when you have that spike in holiday-related sales,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC. \n\n     So far, consumers have proven resilient. Retail spending in the first week of October was up 8.8% compared with the average week in September, according to data from Earnest Research, which tracks credit- and debit-card purchases. \n\n     Barclays PLC economists see consumer spending -- both in goods and services -- rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3% in the fourth quarter from the third. The bank sees a 1.3% growth rate in the third quarter. \n\n     \"There should be some momentum going into the holiday season,\" said Pooja Sriram, a U.S. economist at Barclays. \n\n     Several rounds of government stimulus have left households sitting on roughly $1.6 trillion in savings, representing 9.4% of their disposable income, well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Commerce Department. Private-sector hourly wages were up 4.6% in September over the previous year, according to the Labor Department. \n\n     Friday's report led IHS Markit to raise its economic growth forecasts to 1.6% from 1.4% for the third quarter and to 5.4% from 5.1% for the fourth quarter. \n\n     Increased spending in September contrasted with shoppers' view of the economy dimming. An index of consumer sentiment fell in October to 71.4 from 72.8 in September, the University of Michigan reported Friday. Americans worried about rising prices, product shortages, the labor market, the Delta variant and the ongoing debate on Capitol Hill over infrastructure and social spending, said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. \n\n     Meanwhile, the backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing. Dozens of ships remain anchored off the coast, waiting to be unloaded at U.S. ports. Containers are piled up in warehouses waiting to be shipped and trucking companies can't find enough drivers. \n\n     On Wednesday, the Biden administration said the Port of Los Angeles -- one of the country's busiest -- would operate 24 hours a day in an attempt to clear the backlog. \n\n     IKEA, the world's largest furniture retailer, said Thursday shipping backlogs were making it difficult to get products from warehouses to stores. Still, the company reported higher revenues as customers moved to online sales. \n\n     Business inventories rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said separately Friday. The ratio of inventories to sales, which measures how much is in stock relative to sales, rose slightly but remains well below prepandemic levels. \n\n     James Burris, owner of Black Dog Bikes in Staunton, Va., regularly tells customers looking for a specific item that he can't get it shipped to the store right away because of supply-chain problems. \n\n     \"Not being able to suddenly order one of those higher-end bikes has hurt because we're missing out on the sale,\" he said. The store has a supply of entry-level bikes, he added, and sales overall have been on par with 2019. \n\n     September spending on autos and auto parts rose 0.5% last month even though auto unit sales fell in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.6 million from a recent peak of 18.8 million in April, according to a separate Commerce Department report. \n\n     Economists said the discrepancy was caused by higher prices and manufacturers' greater focus on luxury vehicles.The sector has been hit hard by a global shortage in computer chips, leaving dealers with few cars on their lots. \n\n     Spending at restaurants and bars was up 0.3% in September. Consumers also spent 1.8% more at gas stations, and 3.7% more at sporting goods, music and book stores. \n\n     A delayed back-to-school shopping season may have boosted September's number. Some parents held off on purchases in the summer while waiting for schools to clarify plans, said Ms. Markowska, the Jefferies economist. \n\n     Zach Gray, manager of Music & Arts, a music store in Greenville S.C., said many are buying instruments this year, rather than renting, suggesting consumers have money to spend. \"It's not quite normal for a parent to drop $700 on a saxophone for their sixth-grader who's unsure they want to continue with it,\" he said. \n\n     --Gwynn Guilford contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 15, 2021 14:01 ET (18:01 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.268845Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:46:56.507491Z", "inner_id": 407, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5776, "annotations": [{"id": 6128, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "qWUwvYrWai", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:47:14.158052Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:47:14.158078Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 16.941, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a5e45cdc-931d-4e8e-9148-a4abcba39bea", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5776, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "German Inflation Rose by More Than Expected in October\n\n \n   By Maria Martinez \n \n\n  German consumer prices rose strongly in October, beating forecasts, according to preliminary data released by the German statistics office Destatis on Thursday. \n\n  Consumer prices rose 4.5% on year measured by national standards, above the forecast of 4.4% of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.

Higher wages, including an average 15% increase this year at company-owned U.S. restaurants, is helping, but not as much as anticipated, executives said. \n\n     \"Certainly I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized,\" chief executive Chris Kempczinski told investors Wednesday. \n\n     The Big Mac maker is also paying more for paper, food and other supplies, executives said. McDonald's expects its commodity costs for the year to rise by 3.5% to 4%, up from the 2% they grew earlier in 2021, executives said. \n\n     Those higher costs are making their way to consumers, as McDonald's executives said they expect U.S. prices to be up about 6% this year compared to last year. \n\n     Companies across the globe are raising consumer prices in response to growing costs spanning distribution and freight to fuel and food. U.S. inflation in September remained at its highest rate in more than a decade, Labor Department data showed. \n\n     Many restaurants are raising menu prices to offset higher wages for cooks and servers and rising costs for meat, packaging, vegetable oil and other commodities. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Del Taco Restaurants Inc. and Chili's owner Brinker International Inc. are among the chains that told investors in recent weeks that they have increased prices to help cover costs. \n\n     McDonald's said Wednesday that global same-store sales in the quarter ended Sept. 30 increased 10.2% compared with the same period before the pandemic. U.S. same-store sales were up 14.6% compared with the equivalent 2019 period. \n\n     McDonald's said that bigger order sizes and higher prices increased its revenue in the U.S., as did its new crispy chicken sandwich and celebrity-endorsed meals. Diners are placing more to-go orders and buying for larger groups than prior to the pandemic, contributing to higher sales per customer, executives said. \n\n     \"We are still selling more sandwiches, we're still selling more fries,\" Mr. Kempczinski said. \n\n     McDonald's reported quarterly net income climbed 22% from the same quarter a year earlier, rising to $2.15 billion. Sales totaling $6.2 billion increased 14% from the previous year's period. Adjusting for one-time items, McDonald's said it earned $2.76 a share. \n\n     The company's sales and earnings topped analysts' expectations. McDonald's shares rose 2.2% to $241.57 in morning trading. \n\n     McDonald's slightly increased its projected sales across its restaurants for 2021. It also anticipates opening more restaurants globally, mainly in China and other international markets. In the U.S., supply-chain backlogs for kitchen equipment and permitting delays are postponing some new restaurant openings until next year, the company said. \n\n     McDonald's, the world's biggest burger chain, said that it had fewer Covid-19-related restaurant closures over the past quarter in major markets such as Canada, France and Germany, helping McDonald's sales in those countries. Still, vaccine health pass requirements in France and quarantine orders in Australia, for example, made operations more challenging, the company said. \n\n     In the U.S., roughly 3,000 McDonald's dining rooms remain closed in areas with high Covid-19 infection rates, or roughly 20% of locations. U.S. sales remain elevated at drive-throughs, online and through delivery, even after reopening a location's dining room, executives said. \n\n     McDonald's acquired a string of technology startups prior to the pandemic to develop systems such as voice-recognition ordering at drive-throughs. The company said Wednesday it was selling a technology lab it developed in the Bay Area to International Business Machines Corp. to better advance that work. \n\n     Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 27, 2021 12:12 ET (16:12 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.268939Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:47:55.276505Z", "inner_id": 409, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5778, "annotations": [{"id": 6130, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "BCqj6OPvRZ", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:48:19.822897Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T18:07:13.863865Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 81.954, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "9b1e2ab1-1e17-470e-bb57-546951c6c405", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5778, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Stanley Black &amp; Decker Posts 3Q Sales Growth on Greater Volume, Higher Prices\n\n \n\n     By Matt Grossman \n\n \n\n  Stanley Black & Decker Inc. on Thursday logged higher sales and earnings in the third quarter, with the tool company's chief executive saying it has been raising prices in response to higher input costs. \n\n  The New Britain, Conn.-based company posted earnings of $2.56 a share, compare with $2.44 a share in the comparable period last year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.5%. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 1.8%, its best showing since July. Solid quarterly results from healthcare companies and banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have buoyed the market in recent days.

The reading missed estimates from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the indicator to come in at 73.0. \n\n  \"The Delta variant, supply-chain shortages, and reduced labor-force-participation rates will continue to dim the pace of consumer spending into 2022,\" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  J&J Covid-19 Booster Shot Endorsed by FDA Advisers \n\n  Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously Friday to recommend the agency authorize an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, to shore up protection against the coronavirus. \n\n  The panel of outside doctors and experts voted 19-0 to recommend that all adults who received a first dose of the J&J vaccine should get the second dose at least two months later. \n\n  The FDA could decide on whether to clear a J&J booster within days. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Goldman Sachs Profit Rises on Deal Bonanza \n\n  Companies are ravenous for deals.

Under the new framework, the Fed set aside its practice of raising rates to pre-empt inflationary pressures and pledged to keep interest rates low to foster a faster and broader labor-market recovery. \n\n     Ms. Brainard has been especially outspoken about avoiding the mistakes of raising interest rates prematurely after a downturn when interest rates are near zero. \n\n     Mr. Biden on Monday also said he would nominate Mr. Powell to a second term as Fed chairman. Now, both leaders face perhaps their trickiest policy challenge of the past four years: A bout of inflation that is proving to be more stubborn than anyone at the central bank anticipated is raising questions over how the Fed should set policy in the months ahead. \n\n     Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have underscored the importance of not raising rates until labor markets are tight to build up the credibility of their new framework this year. But with inflation running well above the Fed's 2% target, they are facing questions over how long they can maintain that stance before eroding the central bank's credibility. \n\n     Brisk demand for goods, disrupted supply chains, temporary shortages and a rebound in travel have pushed 12-month inflation to its highest readings in decades. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.1% in October from a year earlier, according to the Fed's preferred gauge. \n\n     \"We're entering a period of great policy uncertainty. Will they raise rates in the first half of 2022? Are they going to have the resolve to wait? It's going to take a lot of courage,\" said Derek Tang, an economist at LH Meyer Inc., an economic-forecasting firm. \n\n     \"Brainard has been very focused on maintaining maximum employment,\" said Mr. Tang. \"If there's a difference between how Powell and Brainard characterize that threshold, the market could ask, 'Who should we listen to?'\" \n\n     If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Brainard would succeed Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, whose term on the central bank's board expires in January. The Fed's vice chair, along with the New York Fed president, is part of the inner circle of advisers -- known as the troika -- that shape the agenda for monetary-policy deliberations by the Fed's rate-setting committee. \n\n     When the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global dash for dollars that overwhelmed the ability of many markets to function in March 2020, Mr. Powell asked Ms. Brainard to join the group, an arrangement that has continued to the present. \n\n     Before joining the Fed in 2014, Ms. Brainard helped manage President Barack Obama's response to the 2008 financial crisis during four years as the Treasury Department's top financial diplomat, making her one of the few Democrats intimately involved in responding to the last two economic shocks. \n\n     Ms. Brainard served as an adviser to President Bill Clinton on international economics in the late 1990s. She also served as a staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the George H.W. Bush administration. \n\n     Even though Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have been aligned on monetary policy, there are questions over how they will resolve differences on other issues. Since he became chairman in 2018, she has dissented on 23 board votes, often to protest against loosening banking rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. \n\n     Among the six sitting Fed governors, Ms. Brainard has spoken the most enthusiastically about the central bank adopting a digital dollar while raising warnings about the risks of unregulated private digital money, including so-called stablecoins that seek to tie the value of their respective offerings to the dollar. \n\n     Ms. Brainard also expressed concern over the dollar losing its dominance in international payments if other central banks, including in China, press ahead with their digital currencies. \n\n     Mr. Powell, on the other hand, told lawmakers this summer he was torn over whether the benefits of issuing a digital dollar outweighed the costs, including potentially disrupting the banking system. \n\n     Ms. Brainard has pulled the Fed her way on some key banking issues, including twice in 2019, both times with crucial backing from Mr. Powell. First, the Fed bucked opposition from big banks when it voted to establish a round-the-clock payment system for banks to exchange money, a proposal she spearheaded. \n\n     Later, the Fed opted against joining two other federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., on a proposal to overhaul rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law designed to end racial lending disparities. After Mr. Biden's election, the OCC scrapped its proposed overhaul. \n\n     Ms. Brainard \"almost single-handedly saved the Community Reinvestment Act and managed to get four Republican governors to vote for her outline, \" said Jesse Van Tol, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. \n\n     Financial-industry officials welcomed both of Mr. Biden's Fed nominations. \"We expect regulators will continue to hold the largest banks to the high regulatory and supervisory standards that have remained in place to support a resilient and essential part of the U.S. financial system,\" said Kevin Fromer, chief executive officer of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest U.S. banks. \n\n     Ms. Brainard received 61 votes during her confirmation in 2014, including from four Republicans who are still in the Senate. \n\n     The daughter of an American diplomat, Ms. Brainard grew up on both sides of the Iron Curtain in Germany and Poland during the Cold War. She has credited that upbringing with fostering her interest in economics. \"I was fascinated by how two countries so close in geography and resources could diverge so sharply simply by being separated by the Iron Curtain,\" she said in a 2014 speech in Claremont, Calif. \n\n     Life in Poland was grim, with an economy that suffocated under a heavy state apparatus, she recalled in a 2017 interview with the college newspaper at Wesleyan University, where she completed her undergraduate degree. The most successful parts of the economy were farming and small-business enterprises that had \"the least amount of red tape and the greatest role for individual initiative,\" she said. \n\n     Ms. Brainard received her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University after a stint working for consulting firm McKinsey & Co. She is married to Kurt Campbell, who is Mr. Biden's point person on Asian affairs on the White House National Security Council. \n\n     Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (November 27, 2021). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 27, 2021 02:32 ET (07:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269053Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:54:02.387375Z", "inner_id": 412, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5781, "annotations": [{"id": 6133, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "wMbxm15IwI", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-03T21:54:36.395824Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-03T21:54:36.395841Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 33.301, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5b861792-1c39-4844-8b23-33b304cf1959", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5781, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "U.S. Retail Sales Rose 1.7% in October -- Update\n\nBy Gabriel T. Rubin \n\n     American consumers spent more at the start of the holiday shopping season, brushing off concerns about higher prices at retailers last month. \n\n     Sales at U.S. retail stores, online sellers, and restaurants rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.7% in October compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Consumers continued their stepped-up spending despite continued Covid-19 fears and inflation concerns. \n\n     Spending rose sharply, by 4%, at online retailers, along with big gains at electronics, appliance and hardware stores. Grocery-store sales rose by 1.1% while restaurant and bar sales were flat. Other gains occurred at gas stations, where sales rose 3.9%, and auto dealerships, with a 1.8% gain. \n\n     Walmart Inc. on Tuesday reported higher sales in the third quarter, saying it increased prices as more consumers shopped early for the holidays. The retailer said U.S. inventory rose as it prepare for \"an expected strong holiday season.\" Home Depot Inc., among several retailers reporting earnings this week, said its third-quarter results were better than expected. \n\n     The elevated spending levels suggest solid holiday sales this month and next. Consumers have said they are worried about inflation, which hit a three-decade high last month, but planned to continue spending. \n\n     \"Consumers say they're pessimistic -- we have had very high inflation -- but the truth is they're in very good shape right now,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. As reasons for the robust demand for goods he cited the roughly $2 trillion in excess savings that households have accrued since the start of the pandemic, as well as low interest rates and an improving labor market. \n\n     Core retail sales, a measurement that excludes spending on autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, were up 1.6%, showing that consumers increased discretionary spending in addition to taking on higher prices for necessary goods. Spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores was up 1.5% and rose by 2.2% at department stores. Pharmacies and clothing stores both saw modest declines from the previous month. \n\n     The combination of strong demand, snarled supply chains, higher prices and an unbalanced labor market is making for an unusual holiday season where record sales may be accompanied by shortages and long waits for goods. Inflation may also start to cut into demand for consumers with lower incomes who may put off purchases due to price increases, economists say. \n\n     Norm Bruce, who with his wife, Eve, owns Martha Merrell's Books and Toys in Waukesha, Wis., said that he expected strong holiday sales. A winter farmers market they set up in front of their Main Street store was a success the first weekend of November, and they plan to continue to use the weekly event to help attract customers. But supply-chain issues and rising prices are taking their toll. \n\n     \"We're telling our customers right now, if you see it, buy it. We don't have 10 or 20 copies of a book right now, we have maybe 1 or 2,\" Mr. Bruce said. \n\n     Most books have prices printed directly on the jacket, preventing Mr. Bruce from charging more. But to keep up with supply pressures, the store has had to raise prices on some other items, giving some customers sticker shock. \n\n     \"All of a sudden, I was having to put increases of $4 or $5 on stuffed animals, because the shipping cost has gone up tremendously,\" Mr. Bruce said. \"Consumers right now are very forgiving, but when the prices start going up, they say, that's a stuffed dog, I don't want to pay that much.\" \n\n     Retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation, so some of the increase can be attributed to higher prices. \n\n     The backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing, as container ships struggle to unload their cargo at U.S. ports. Containers can wait weeks before they are picked up by trucking companies, which say they can't find enough drivers to meet demand. \n\n     The resulting inflation, if left unchecked, could start eating into consumers' budgets enough to tamp down on the elevated demand for goods, Mr. Faucher said. But there are strong incentives for retailers to get their supply chains sorted out. \n\n     \"If you can find out how to get your product to consumers when they're having trouble finding things, you're going to make a lot of money,\" he said. \n\n     Companies attempting to get ahead of the holiday crush may have simply moved it forward by a few weeks, according to a study by Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. \n\n     Imports are up 20.5% compared with 2019. And individual companies are experiencing longer shipping times for goods, which then prompts them to order goods even earlier ahead of peak shopping times. \n\n     Online shopping has dominated the early days of the holiday retail rush, but that is expected to shift to in-store shopping as the holidays get closer and customers try to avoid shipping delays. And some gift-givers may choose to opt out of material gifts altogether. \n\n     \"Gift card and digital e-gift card sales have also been trending up recently which could continue to be a theme through the holidays,\" said Felipe Chacon, an economist at payments company Square. \n\n     Labor shortages are also contributing to price increases as businesses struggle to meet customer demand. \n\n     Maureen Craig, who owns the Southern Cajun-Creole restaurant Alligator Soul in Savannah, Ga., said that the main thing preventing her from having her best year ever is inability to find enough staff. \n\n     Restaurant and bar sales remained flat between September and October, a sign of weakness in the recovery for an industry that has struggled with a wave of quitting employees, high food prices and persistently high Covid-19 case levels. Restaurants, especially in northern states, are bracing for another winter dependent in part on outdoor dining as some customers remain reluctant to dine indoors. \n\n     \"It's been very, very difficult to hire -- more in the kitchen than in the front of the house,\" Ms. Craig said. She recently decided to close the restaurant on Sundays to alleviate some of the pressure on her chef and kitchen staff. Customers have taken it in stride when she calls them to tell them she has to switch their reservations. \n\n     \"Everyone understands it's an impossible time right now,\" she said. \"I don't want to sacrifice their experience for the almighty dollar.\" \n\n     Write to Gabriel T.

Strauss \n\n     More than a dozen S&P 500 companies declared dividend increases this week as earnings season, typically a busy time for such announcements, rolls ahead. Estee Lauder Companies, Becton, Dickinson, and Simon Property Group were on the list. \n\n     Estee Lauder (ticker: EL), whose portfolio includes fragrances and skin-care products, said it would boost its quarterly payout to 60 cents a share, up 13% from 53 cents. The stock, which was recently yielding 0.7%, has returned about 28% this year through the close on Thursday, dividends included. That is a little ahead of the S&P 500's 26% return. \n\n     Medical technology company Becton, Dickinson (BDX) declared a quarterly dividend of 87 cents a share. That is an increase of about 5%, or 4 cents a share. \n\n     The stock, which has returned about minus 1% this year, yields 1.4%. This marks the 50(th) straight year in which the company has raised its dividend. It is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, whose members have paid out a higher dividend for at least 25 straight years. \n\n     Simon Property Group (SPG), a real estate investment trust focused on shopping malls and outlets, is planning to raise its dividend for the third time this year. Its board this week declared a quarterly disbursement of $1.65 a share, an increase of 10% from $1.50. \n\n     In June, the company said it would boost its quarterly dividend to $1.40 a share from $1.30. In August, management declared a quarterly dividend of $1.50. \n\n     The stock, which yields 3.9%, has returned about 100% this year, reflecting increasingly positive investor sentiment toward shopping malls and the economy's reopening following the pandemic. \n\n     Emerson Electric (EMR) said it plans to raise its dividend by a penny, or 2%, to 51.5 cents a share. The stock, which has returned about 23% this year, yields 2.1%. The company is also a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. \n\n     Devon Energy (DVN) declared a quarterly dividend of 84 cents a share, up sharply from 49 cents a share previously. The increase reflects higher oil prices and improved conditions in the energy business. \n\n     The company's board also authorized a $1 billion share- repurchase program through the end of 2022 -- a total equal to about 4% of the company's market capitalization. Devon Energy has a fixed dividend with variable additional payouts that hinge on business conditions. \n\n     In the previous quarter, the fixed dividend was 11 cents a share, while the variable one was 38 cents, for a total of 49 cents. The stock, which has returned about 180% this year, yields 2.9%. \n\n     Pharmaceutical drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 2 cents a share, to 46 cents, an increase of 4.5%. \n\n     The stock, which yields 1.4%, has returned about 31% year to date. \n\n     In other news, apparel company PVH (PVH) said that its board's executive committee on Oct. 29 declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 3.75 cents a share on the common stock. \n\n     The dividend was suspended last year due to the pandemic. The stock has returned about 27% this year. \n\n     The company's brands include Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. \n\n     Write to Lawrence C.

It Seems So -- Barron&apos;s\n\nBy Lisa Beilfuss \n\n     Inflation is making consumers miserable. To judge from retail sales, that might not matter -- for now. But lofty inflation expectations are a warning worth heeding, potentially signaling slower economic growth ahead. \n\n     When the Commerce Department reported October sales across retail and food-services stores, the results far exceeded expectations, with total sales rising at the fastest pace since March. On the heels of a surprisingly sluggish third-quarter gross-domestic-product report that showed the slowest pace of growth since the recovery began, solid retail sales reminded investors that U.S. consumers are flush, shopping, and still powering economic activity. \n\n     You wouldn't know it, though, to look at confidence surveys. Take the latest report from the University of Michigan. Consumer sentiment fell in early November to its lowest level in a decade, says Richard Curtin, the survey's director. \n\n     The details are even drearier: A quarter of U.S. households expect their financial situation to deteriorate, the biggest share since 2008; half of respondents say the national economy has recently weakened and will continue to do so in the year ahead; and nearly six in 10 consumers think bad times financially will persist in the next five years. Economists at Goldman Sachs say the recent declines in the Michigan gauge would imply a 0.4% drag on fourth-quarter annualized consumption growth, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP. \n\n     What consumers say and what they do don't always jibe. Some economists shun sentiment surveys, viewing them as useless when spending data are readily available each month. After all, the golden rule of behavioral economics is to observe what people pay, not what they say, economist Dan Geller notes. \n\n     But it isn't that simple. Since retail sales are reported in nominal terms, meaning the data aren't inflation-adjusted, it is worth considering the corresponding increase in the consumer price index. That's a back-of-the-envelope way to inflation-adjust the sales figure, says Citi economist Veronica Clark. Applying the CPI roughly suggests that higher prices represented about half of the October increase in sales, with actual sales volume representing the balance. \n\n     Higher prices aren't altogether bad. Companies are successfully passing on climbing wages, rising material prices, and surging shipping costs, protecting profit margins and then padding them some more. Anxious about supply-chain challenges, retailers began pushing out a wave of holiday deals in October, a report from software company Adobe shows. But those deals have been skimpy. Prices rose in 12 of 18 categories last month; they almost always fell, on average, during the same period from 2015 to 2019. \n\n     Expectations for record-high corporate profit margins of 13.1% this year, 13.2% next year, and 13.8% in 2023 are proof that cost pressures aren't squeezing margins, says Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Retailers' stocks are benefiting. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (ticker: XRT) is up 10% this month and 61% this year, far outpacing respective gains of 2% and 25% in the S&P 500 index. Consumers might not be happy about it, but they are paying up. \n\n     At least for now. \"I wouldn't look at it and say, 'All our concerns are gone,' \" notes Citi's Clark of the upside retail sales report. \"Part of it is that prices are pulling forward holiday shopping,\" she adds. \n\n     While solid October sales augur well for fourth-quarter GDP, Clark cautions of possible payback in November and December, with sales in those months potentially lower because consumers shopped earlier. \n\n     Therein lies one reason not to discard survey data that are so glaringly conflicting with reality, or at least the reality before it is adjusted for inflation. Curtin at the University of Michigan attributes falling confidence almost entirely to rising prices. While respondents widely reported nominal income gains, half of all families foresee reduced real incomes next year, and a quarter say they already feel inflation is reducing their standard of living, he says. \n\n     Consumers speeding up purchases in anticipation of higher prices is the very dynamic central bankers fear. If real-world prices shape inflation expectations that wind up determining actual inflation, perception becomes reality. In fact, the report's measure of inflation expectations over the next year edged up to 4.9%, the highest since 2008, with 71% of all consumers surveyed predicting higher prices in the year ahead. \n\n     It's important to note that long-term inflation expectations within the latest Michigan survey held at 2.9% -- elevated, but not alarmingly so. One reading: Consumers buy the narrative that inflation is mostly transitory, believing that rates of prices increase will slow after next year. But not everyone is sold. \n\n     Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, notes that the share of people expecting inflation to be around the Federal Reserve's 2% target over the next year has fallen sharply, and is near the lowest level observed over the past few decades. The number of people predicting inflation of 3% or higher has shot up dramatically, driven by the share of people anticipating inflation of 15% or more. \n\n     Few things are seeing prices rise at that pace. \"But the simple fact that people perceive it that way should be enough to scare the Fed,\" Porcelli says, adding that inflation fear is widespread, with the entire income distribution on the same page. \n\n     The question isn't whether consumers feel inflation and expect it to run higher over the next year. It's whether consumers are spending now because of those rising inflation expectations at the expense of future spending -- or in spite of them. \n\n     Write to Lisa Beilfuss at lisa.beilfuss@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 19, 2021 21:30 ET (02:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269159Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:38:47.124354Z", "inner_id": 415, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5784, "annotations": [{"id": 6267, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "WkjifW5rCv", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T19:40:09.942097Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:40:09.942114Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-04T19:39:37.602559Z", "lead_time": 82.028, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "55fdb8ec-d744-4aea-ae1e-47ee5a6c7a24", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5784, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "The 10-Point: The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Guide to the Day&apos;s Top News\n\nBy Matt Murray \n\n  Good Morning. In today's edition, small-cap stocks get a boost, inflation means bigger profits for some U.S. businesses, a path to international carbon trading, and Covid-19 cases rise in the North and West. \n\n  Small-cap stocks are getting a boost as investors seek refuge from inflation \n\n  The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks has advanced 5% in November, outpacing the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark's 1.7% gain. Investors are focusing on small companies that they hope can respond quickly to rising inflation. Confidence in the Russell 2000 also tends to reflect positive expectations for the economy, in part because economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials and industrials make up more of the small-cap stock index than of the S&P 500. Investors seeking refuge from inflation have also driven the price of gold up 4.8% this month and sent materials stocks up 5.8% -- putting the group at the lead of the S&P 500's 11 sectors for November. Demand for 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, meanwhile, has dragged yields to record lows. The prospect of negative returns on super safe inflation-protected bonds has pushed investors to buy riskier assets. \n\n  -- In global trading today, Asian stock markets closed mostly higher, Europe was mixed at midday and U.S. stock futures were up. \n\n  -- Mall stocks are back in fashion as shoppers return. \n\n  -- In 2018, uBiome was raising its third round of venture-capital funding, which eventually amounted to $59 million. Just one year later, the company had collapsed. \n\n \n\n  Some companies are raising prices enough to outrun inflation and produce some of their fattest profit margins. After decades of grinding down costs and prices, industries including retail, manufacturing and biotech have seen their profits rise. Other industries, largely those still climbing out of pandemic lockdowns, such as travel, or those too weighted with inflationary costs, have raised prices but haven't experienced a profit boost. \n\n  -- The cost to ship a container across the Pacific fell by more than 25% last week, signaling easing demand for Asian exports. \n\n  -- The Biden administration is stressing its efforts to fight rising costs as high inflation puts its political fortunes at risk. \n\n  -- A decision on who will be next to head the Federal Reserve is expected as soon as this week. \n\n \n\n  Workers ages 25 to 54 are returning at a slower rate, damping expectations for a bigger workforce this fall \n\n  Roughly 1.4 million fewer so-called prime-age workers are working or looking for a job than in the month before the pandemic hit. Factors that were expected to push up job participation this fall, like school reopenings and the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits, aren't as important as previously thought or are taking a long time to boost labor supply. Dwindling savings could drive some workers back; others might settle into a new lifestyle and never return. A slow labor-force recovery could keep propelling wages higher as employers compete for a shrunken pool of workers. Such wage growth could prolong inflationary pressures and force the Fed to raise rates sooner than it otherwise would. \n\n  -- Turnover isn't evenly spread across the U.S. workforce, according to new data on people who have quit. \n\n  -- The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is electing a new president this week. \n\n  -- M.B.A. starting salaries are hitting record highs in a tight labor market. \n\n  -- Malaysia is testing whether its economy can run with fewer foreign workers. \n\n \n\n  Manufacturers struggling with a shortage of chips are finding workarounds -- redesigning products, shipping uncompleted units and focusing on older, lower-tech models. Reworking products has been cumbersome for some companies and challenging for consumers who received products with missing features. Some companies ended up with better products.

Governments from nearly every country endorsed a set of preliminary rules over how governments and companies can create, value and swap credits to drive their net emissions lower in a global trading system. Negotiations over the carbon agreement were overshadowed by a higher-profile deal on emissions cuts and climate-change funding. That broader deal asks its 190-plus signatories next year to revisit emissions-cutting plans that fell short of what scientists say is enough to prevent the worst possible effects of climate change. The deal, though, left big questions about how governments will follow through. \n\n  -- Royal Dutch Shell plans to consolidate its dual-share structure and move its headquarters to London to help it navigate the transition to low-carbon energy. \n\n \n\n  Covid-19 cases are climbing in the upper Midwest, Southwest and parts of the Northeast. Health authorities say the Delta variant is easily finding pockets of unvaccinated people, even in some of the most-vaccinated places, like Vermont, where about 72% of the population is fully inoculated. Meanwhile, some states, like Michigan, report that fully vaccinated people are increasingly adding to their Covid-19 numbers -- reflecting both the rising number of vaccinated people and the vaccines' waning effectiveness among people who got the shots early on. The stalled progress is an unwelcome turn as more people are expected to travel and congregate indoors during the Thanksgiving holiday. \n\n  Quote of the Day: \n\n  \"After nearly two years, I don't blame anyone for feeling done with the Covid-19 pandemic.

Its shares (ticker: ACX.Spain) fell 32% from December 2019 to October 2020. \n\n     The stock has bounced back this year, gaining 14%, to a recent 10.30 euros (about $11.64). Last month, Acerinox, which markets its products in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, flagged a jump in demand for alloys and stainless steel. Acerinox says it's on course for its strongest annual results in its 51-year history, despite rising energy prices. \n\n     The pickup in demand, which analysts predict will be sustained well into 2022, isn't the only catalyst for growth. The company's $587 million acquisition of German-based alloy maker VDM Metals two years ago is performing ahead of expectations, which Bastian Synagowitz, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, predicts will lead to a continuation of buybacks or extra dividends. He has a price target of EUR17 on Acerinox. \n\n     Although Acerinox hasn't announced plans for its loss-making Malaysian unit, there has been speculation about a divestiture. A sale would boost the stock to EUR20, predicts Franco German broker Oddo BHF. Acerinox declined to comment. \n\n     I\u00f1igo Recio Pascual, an analyst at Spain's GVC Gaesco, tells Barron's that \"order books suggest that, at least in the first part of [2022], the stainless steel market will remain strong. Inventories still remain at reasonable levels.\" He adds that another growth driver is price negotiations with customers, particularly in the auto sector, for annual contracts, \"with good prospects for 2022, especially in Europe, as during 2021 price increases have not been passed on to them.\" \n\n     Acerinox has a market value of EUR2.7 billion, with production sites in the U.S., Germany, Spain, Malaysia, and South Africa. It fetches a low 5.1 times this year's expected earnings, in line with its peers. \n\n     In 2020, Acerinox posted revenue of EUR4.6 billion, down from EUR4.7 billion in the prior year. Nonetheless, profit was EUR49 million, versus a EUR60 million loss in 2019. The company credited this to cost-cutting. In this year's first nine months, net profit rose to EUR373 million from EUR31 million in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue climbed 38%, to EUR4.77 billion. \n\n     Steel demand depends on overall GDP growth, with autos and household appliances key. In 2020, companies held steel inventories to a minimum. \"Demand has come back with strength,\" says analyst Pascual. Despite a fourth wave of Covid-19, major economies such as Germany and the U.S. are resisting a return to growth-sapping restrictions. \n\n     Recent developments in China also might help Acerinox. In April, under pressure to create a more level playing field, Beijing agreed to remove a 13% value-added-tax rebate for steel exports, which will increase costs for Chinese producers. Acerinox doesn't sell directly in China, but that nation accounts for 50% of global steel consumption and production, so its influence on demand and production is important for overall prices, analysts say. \n\n     In a quarterly update in November, Acerinox's chief executive officer, Bernardo Velazquez Herreros, said: \"We estimate that Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] will improve slightly from the third to the fourth quarter, due to strong demand and low inventory levels. If these forecasts prove correct, we will achieve our best results ever.\" \n\n     Write to Rupert Steiner at rupert.steiner@dowjones.com \n\n \nGlobal Indexes: http://www.barrons.com/public/page/9_0210-djglobalidx.html \n\n  To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 10, 2021 21:30 ET (02:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269233Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:41:05.692958Z", "inner_id": 417, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5786, "annotations": [{"id": 6269, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "ZiQQ4CE8A_", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T19:42:18.607814Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:42:18.607833Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-04T19:42:14.194382Z", "lead_time": 72.21, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3921568e-2b35-40da-a4da-b4694f47710c", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5786, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "EMEA Morning Briefing: Stocks to Extend Gain After Wall Street Ends Losing Streak\n\n  MARKET WRAPS \n\n  Watch For: \n\n  UK quarterly national accounts; UK Balance of Payments. \n\n  Opening Call: \n\n  European stocks could open higher, U.S. stock futures edge lower. Dollar is slightly higher in Asia, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edges higher. Oil gains, gold steady. \n\n  Equities: \n\n  European stocks are set to extend gains and follow Wall Street higher Wednesday after President Joe Biden reassured investors by calling for vaccinations and testing but no travel curbs in response to the omicron coronavirus variant. \n\n  Biden announced the government will provide 500 million free rapid-test kits and increase vaccination efforts but gave no indication of plans for travel bans or other restrictions that might disrupt the economy. Other governments in Asia and Europe have tightened travel controls or pushed back plans to relax curbs already in place. \n\n  Biden \"provided some much-needed reassurances for markets,\" Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report. \n\n  Stocks in Asia were cautiously higher and U.S. stock futures edged lower. \n\n  \"With pre-holiday liquidity tumbling, and market direction entirely dominated by headline derived volatility, it is probably not wise to get too wedded to \"the worst is over just yet. I'll say is again, volatility is the winner in December, not thematic direction,\" said Jeffrey Halley at OANDA. \n\n  Meanwhile, December's decline in consumer confidence adds to the list of deteriorating consumer indicators, Capital Economics's senior Europe economist Jack Allen-Reynolds said. The European Commission's measure of consumer confidence fell from minus 6.8 in November to minus 8.3 in December. \n\n  Apart from this weakening, other indicators such as mobility trackers also point to a recent drop in spending, Allen-Reynolds said. \n\n  The economist said the data is consistent with Capital Economics's view that GDP growth will slow sharply in the fourth quarter but avoid a contraction. Looking ahead, the pandemic situation presents a big downside risk to 1Q, with the economy set to start next year on the back foot. \n\n  The combination of a high speed of propagation of the Omicron coronavirus variant and a still significant number of people without any protection may mean that additional restrictions will be needed in the weeks ahead as a \"circuit breaker\" to preserve healthcare capacity, Gilles Moec, Group Chief Economist at AXA Investment Managers said. \n\n  This would dent global GDP growth this winter, even if it would likely be a mere pause in the recovery trajectory, he said. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a downside risk to AXA IM's forecasts for 2022, Moec said. However, \"we aren't back to square one in the fight against the pandemic,\" he added. \n\n  Stocks to watch: Miner Rio Tinto's purchase of the Rincon lithium project in Argentina demonstrates its confidence in the battery material's outlook and reflects an earlier commitment to invest in commodities such as lithium needed for a low-carbon economy, said Macquarie. \n\n  Rincon has the potential to produce 50,000 tons a year of lithium carbonate for 40 years, lifting Rio's long-term lithium-carbonate production outlook to 108,000 tons a year, Macquarie said. Rio was down 1.6% in Sydney. \n\n  Forex: \n\n  The US dollar was slightly stronger in early Asia trading. \"For the most part, the dollar has been king,\" this year, Scott Petruska, chief currency strategist at Silicon Valley Bank, told WSJ. \n\n  But over the past five weeks or so the rally has flagged due to a combination of factors including Treasurys stalling and big central banks becoming more hawkish. \n\n  \"The dollar's safe-haven role is still front and center,\" Petruska said. The market is still very long the dollar, he said, and thinks the dollar index could still increase by one percent. Then in 2Q or 3Q, \"hopefully we'll have a global recovery and then the dollar will turn lower.\" \n\n  Asian currencies consolidate against USD amid mixed developments. Overnight gains on Wall Street have boosted risk sentiment in Asia today; however, the relatively quiet economic calendar may put focus on the ongoing risks of the Covid-19 Omicron variant to the region's reopening plans, IG said. \n\n  Bonds: \n\n  The 10-year yield rose to 1.469% from Tuesday's 1.461%. Federal Reserve Bank of New York research said central-bank bond buying done in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, did a good job of restoring market functioning in the face of heavy stress. \n\n  \"While it is difficult to pin down the effects of the Fed's purchases amidst the pandemic and numerous policy actions, the evidence suggests they were effective,\" said the bank. \n\n  The paper did add that the purchases were not a panacea, and the fact that the Fed rode to the market's rescue may increase moral hazard risks and make market participants believe the central bank will bail them out next time there's trouble. \n\n  Energy: \n\n  Oil rose in the morning Asian session on hopes that holiday travel-related demand will be stable. There appears to be optimism that holiday travel will remain intact for most vaccinated individuals, Oanda said. \n\n  Both the U.S. and the U.K. don't appear to be heading for pandemic-related lockdowns, suggesting oil's short-term outlook may not be completely derailed by the Omicron variant, Oanda added. \n\n  Metals: \n\n  Gold was trading steadily in the morning Asian session, and could consolidate during the rest of the holiday-shortened week. \n\n  Gold prices are figuring out their year-end trading range somewhere around $1,800/oz and that should remain intact as trading volumes decrease, Oanda said. Major markets such as Wall Street and including those for precious metals, will be closed on Friday in observance of the Christmas holiday. \n\n  Copper shifted lower in early Asian trading, with traders taking more short positions amid a bearish macro outlook, brokerage Marex said. \n\n  The bearishness is \"reflected in positioning where we see shorts across all three exchanges,\" it said, referring to the LME, Comex, Shanghai Futures Exchange. \n\n  However, logistics issues at Las Bambas copper mine, which produces 2% of the world's copper supply, could limit losses, Marex said. Protesters in Peru have been blocking a road used by the MMG-owned mine. \n\n  Lithium-rich spodumene is likely to remain in short supply, as increased production from mining operations is outpaced by demand from the electric-vehicle market, said Macquarie. \n\n  \"Lithium production rates have increased over 2021, with solid increases from spodumene producers in Western Australia and rising production from South America\" but \"the increase has failed to suppress spot lithium prices,\" said Macquarie. \n\n  The bank--which raises its spodumene price forecasts, including for 2022 by 71%, to $2,363/ton--said the market has swung to a deficit in 2021 from a surplus last year, and that the shortfall should deepen over this decade. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES \n\n  Biden Administration to Combat Omicron by Distributing 500 Million At-Home Covid-19 Test Kits \n\n  WASHINGTON-The Biden administration is preparing to distribute 500 million free at-home Covid-19 testing kits to Americans and deploy military doctors and nurses to overburdened hospitals this winter, as the Omicron variant becomes the dominant form of the virus in the U.S. \n\n  \"We have to do more. We have to do better-and we will,\" President Biden said at the White House on Tuesday during a speech outlining the new coronavirus-response measures. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Biden Is Considering Lifting Travel Ban on Southern African Countries \n\n  President Biden said he is considering lifting a travel ban he imposed last month on non-U. S. citizen travelers from South Africa and seven other southern African countries. \n\n  He told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that the Omicron variant's wide spread in the U.S. could prompt him to lift the restrictions. \"Remember why I said we put the travel ban on. It was to see how much time we had before it hit here so we can begin to decide what we needed by looking up what was happening in other countries,\" he said. \"But we're past that now.\" \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Surging Inflation Has Workers Demanding Bigger Raises. Could It Lead to a Wage-Price Spiral? \n\n  The COLA is making a comeback. \n\n  Higher prices, a worker shortage and a revitalized labor movement are bringing about the return of pay increases tied to inflation, known as cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  IRS Says Tax-Free Maltese Pensions Are Too Good to Be True \n\n  Officials of the U.S. and Malta have signed an agreement cracking down on Maltese pension maneuvers used by some wealthy Americans to avoid taxes, the Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday. \n\n  The IRS also said it was \"actively examining\" taxpayers who set up Maltese pensions. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.S. current account deficit widens sharply in third quarter \n\n  The U.S. current account deficit widened 8.3% to $214.8 billion in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It is the largest deficit since 2006. The trade gap has widened for seven straight quarters. \n\n  The widening of the deficit reflected a reduced surplus on services, which have been hit hard by the coronavirus.

That was the fastest pace since 1982 and the sixth straight month in which inflation topped 5%. \n\n     The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 4.9% in November from a year earlier. That was a sharper increase than October's 4.6% rise, and the highest rate since 1991. \n\n     The increase in prices for new vehicles, which came in at 11.1% in November, was the largest on record, as were those for men's apparel and living room, kitchen and dining room furniture. A 7.9% surge in fast-food restaurant prices last month marked the sharpest on record too. \n\n     The steady rise in restaurant prices during the past few months is a sign of pass-through from wages into higher prices, economists say. That dynamic is increasingly showing up in other industries. Wages tracked by the Atlanta Fed climbed 4.3% in November, up from 4.1% in October and the highest since 2007. \n\n     Some energy prices showed signs of easing -- in part because of fear in the financial markets that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 could slow growth. But gasoline rose at a 6.1% monthly rate for the second straight month. \n\n     The November prices trend came before the emergence of the Omicron variant, which poses a new threat from a pandemic that is well into its second year. But the sharp price increases are the result of a booming economy that has developed imbalances in supply and demand as the U.S. continues to recover from the pandemic. \n\n     \"We have tremendous spending by consumers. A lot of people are getting hired. Demand is huge,\" Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics, Inc. said. He added that higher-than-expected inflation implies a needed pullback in fiscal and monetary stimulus. \"Even after doing that, the economy should still be in super shape producing growth rates and earnings not seen in decades.\" \n\n     On a monthly basis, the CPI increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in November from the prior month, about the same as October's 0.9% increase. \n\n     The latest strong inflation report strengthens the case for Federal Reserve officials to commit to hastening the wind-down of their stimulus efforts, paving the way to raise interest rates in the spring to curb inflation. \n\n     \"I think the Fed already got ahead of today's data by pre-announcing that they will accelerate the taper next week,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC. \n\n     Stocks and oil prices gained and government bond yields fell after the inflation figures reinforced expectations that the economy should slow gradually next year as the Fed tightens monetary policy. \n\n     Unlike in past recoveries, strong demand for goods such as autos, furniture and appliances has driven much of the inflation surge. Prices for services -- such as for travel and recreation -- have generally climbed much less with softer demand. The holiday season is likely exacerbating these dynamics, Ms. Markowska said, adding the supply and demand imbalance will continue to widen. \n\n     A shortage of available workers is also affecting inflation and the overall economy, pushing companies to raise prices to offset higher labor costs. Companies are setting aside an average 3.9% of total payroll for wage increases next year, the most since 2008, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a private research group. \n\n     Tip Hongchindaget said that while demand at her Charlotte, N.C., restaurant is booming, higher costs and scarce labor are squeezing her business. A surge in chicken prices has wiped out what used to be a reliable source of profit for her restaurant, Rice & Spice Thai Street Food. And though sales are strong, the dearth of workers has prompted her to start closing for Sunday lunch. \n\n     \"It has happened like a storm, and it just keeps coming,\" she said. \"I don't think we can keep giving more people higher wages.\" \n\n     Ms. Tip said she is now researching technological upgrades that might require less labor. She is reluctant to increase prices after having done so earlier this year, especially since the area's other Asian restaurants haven't raised prices much. \"If we raise the price again this time, I'm pretty sure it's going to impact\" sales, she said. \n\n     On Thursday Costco Wholesale Corp. said its prices likely grew between 4.5% to 5% during the most recent quarter, a bit higher than the company predicted the previous quarter. \"I think it's going to continue,\" said Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti on a call to discuss earnings. \"Hopefully, we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding, but we'll see.\" \n\n     Hormel Foods Corp., maker of Spam and Skippy peanut butter, said on Thursday that it raised prices on many of its different pantry staples, citing sharply higher costs. The Minnesota-based company said it raised the price of its Jennie-O turkey, for example, to counter higher feed costs and labor shortages. \"In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels,\" said chief financial officer James Sheehan on a call with analysts. \n\n     Sixty percent of small-business owners said they had increased prices in the previous 90 days, according to a November survey of more than 560 small businesses for The Wall Street Journal by Vistage Worldwide Inc., a business-coaching and peer-advisory firm. Eighty percent of the companies surveyed reported increased labor costs, while 72% said their suppliers had raised prices. \n\n     Companies are still struggling to get materials, though supply constraints were showing signs of easing before the Omicron variant emerged. The most prominent example of strained supply chains is a shortage of semiconductors that has hamstrung auto production. \n\n     Economists generally see inflationary pressure from supply constraints easing in 2022 as sidelined workers return, consumer demand for goods cools and production ramps up. However, they also expect those to be replaced by more persistent sources of price pressure such as rent and medical care. \n\n     Aichi Amemiya, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities, said a continuing shift in consumer spending from goods to services should also help calm inflation. Signs of improving transportation costs and auto production hint that inflationary pressure could begin easing early next year, though it is likely to remain high in December, Mr. Amemiya said. \n\n     Covid-19 continues to be a wild-card factor. Past virus surges have put downward pressure on prices for travel, recreation and other services that involve in-person interaction. However, a resurgence of cases ultimately could push inflation higher by increasing consumer demand for goods and triggering shutdowns of factories and ports, Mr. Amemiya said. \n\n     Persistently elevated inflation is hitting consumer budgets. \n\n     Dallas resident Greg Chu noticed a rise in his gasoline costs earlier this year -- an increase so sharp that he said he took his car to a mechanic. But there was nothing wrong with his car: The problem was much higher gas prices. The 27-year-old has taken to meticulously planning his day to reduce driving. Since food prices began rising last spring, he also is dining out less and is buying less meat and dairy at the grocery store. \n\n     \"Inflation has changed how I drive, shop and eat,\" said Mr. Chu, who works as an accountant. \"I can afford to pay these price increases, but at the cost of reducing my other expenses or savings, which I am not willing to do.\" \n\n     --Sarah Nassauer and Patrick Thomas contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Gwynn Guilford at gwynn.guilford@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (December 11, 2021). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 11, 2021 02:33 ET (07:33 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269312Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:43:10.357873Z", "inner_id": 419, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5788, "annotations": [{"id": 6271, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "_2pNro4FaW", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T19:55:18.224612Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:55:18.224627Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 727.029, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "a3649d8c-6ef5-4070-a489-98e8a36af5c7", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5788, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Dole Looks for Deals and Operational Efficiency After NYSE Listing\n\nBy Nina Trentmann \n\n     Dole, the fruit and vegetable company best known for its banana brand, is scouting the market for potential acquisition targets and working to streamline its operations after combining with Total Produce PLC and listing on the New York Stock Exchange. \n\n     In 2018, the company that previously operated as Dole Food Co. agreed to sell itself to Total Produce, which initially acquired a 45% stake. In July, Total Produce bought the rest of the business and the combined company began trading on the public markets as Dole PLC. \n\n     The initial public offering provided Dole with just under $400 million in new equity, which the company used to pay down costly debt and strengthen its balance sheet. The company also arranged $1.44 billion in new financing, including a term loan and a revolving credit facility. \n\n     \"Dole was heavily indebted and had a lot of expensive debt,\" said Chief Financial Officer Frank Davis, who previously served as finance chief of Total Produce. \n\n     The combined business had pro-forma revenue of $9 billion for 2020 and the company has said it expects 2021 revenue of between $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion. Dole, which had $4.7 billion in total assets as of Sept. 30, is looking to grow its business, including through bolt-on acquisitions, Mr. Davis said. \n\n     Total Produce, which was formed in 2006 after a split from banana-grower Fyffes PLC, has completed over 100 acquisitions since its inception, according to Mr. Davis, often by taking a minority stake and growing it over time. The combined Dole is now scouting the market for targets in the U.S. as well as in other countries and wants to acquire assets in fast growing categories, including avocados and berries. \n\n     The company is forecasting it can achieve $30 million to $40 million in annual synergies over a three- to five-year period in areas such as sourcing and shipping, Mr. Davis said. The company said the savings won't come from cuts to its more than 40,000 employee workforce. Dole also expects it will save about $40 million a year in interest costs after its recent refinancing. \n\n     Its leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio between net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stood at 2.76 times at the end of the third quarter, down from over 5 times before Total Produce became an investor, according to Mr. Davis. The combined company is targeting a leverage ratio of around 3 times, he said. \n\n     \"We have significant headroom to be able to do acquisitions,\" Mr. Davis said. The company reported net debt of $1.13 billion at the end of September, down from $1.51 billion at the close of March. \n\n     Dole will likely act as a consolidator in a fragmented market, said Roland French, an equity analyst at Davy Research, the research arm of the wealth management company Davy Group. \n\n     \"The IPO transaction allowed the company to de-lever the Dole balance sheet, which is a key part of the growth story in the context of driving future M&A,\" Mr. French said. Being part of a bigger entity will allow Dole to get better freight and procurement rates and drive revenue synergies, he added. \n\n     Like other food businesses, Dole is facing higher costs for labor and logistics. The company, which has raised prices on certain salads and fresh vegetables, is considering more increases if inflation persists, its finance chief said. \"Everybody in the wider industry is experiencing this,\" Mr. Davis said. \n\n     The company owns 13 container ships to transport bananas, pineapples and other products and operates 11 of those ships itself. \n\n     \"By owning and controlling our own fleet of ships and containers, we aren't as exposed as others,\" the CFO said, adding the company will continue to search for ways to offset recent cost increases. \n\n     Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 21, 2021 05:30 ET (10:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269344Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:55:18.438218Z", "inner_id": 420, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5789, "annotations": [{"id": 6272, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "mJDkjCYFzL", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T19:56:17.154330Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:56:17.154356Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 46.913, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "46df8370-b540-4c17-adfe-950e7cfa04dc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5789, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Real Time Economics: So This Is Christmas\n\n   Omicron Starts to Slow U.S. Economy \n\n  Signs are mounting that the U.S. economy is losing some steam as the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus spreads rapidly through parts of the country. The number of diners seated at restaurants nationwide was down 15% in the week ended Dec. 22 from the same period in 2019, a steeper decline than in late November, data from reservations site OpenTable show. U.S. hotel occupancy was at 53.8% for the week ended Dec. 18, slightly below the previous week's level, according to STR, a global hospitality data and analytics company. Rising case numbers are leading many businesses to close for a short period, entertainment venues to cancel shows, universities to shift classes online and offices to delay or reverse reopening plans, Sarah Chaney Cambon and Harriet Torry report. \n\n  Still, low unemployment, substantial savings and briskly rising wages are giving Americans money to spend. Many are also eager to go out and gather with family after nearly two years of social-distancing protocols. For now, economists expect the highly contagious Omicron variant to cause a short-term soft patch for spending and broader economic growth. Many economists have lowered their growth projections for early 2022 due to growing concerns about the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But much of the difference in output could be delayed, rather than lost altogether. \n\n  Enjoying this newsletter? Get more from WSJ and support our work with a special subscription offer .  Top Stories Some Good, Some Bad and Some Ugly \n\n  Consumer spending was strong heading into Omicron, and it will be after. The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that consumer spending rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in November from October and also revised its October spending figures higher. Digging into the data, the November increase was driven by a 0.9% gain in services expenditures. Spending on goods rose just 0.1%. And that is before the bite from inflation. While rising Covid-19 cases appear to be depressing activity this month, the Omicron surge won't last forever-indeed, given its very speed, and the recent experience of other countries, it might not last very long. In its aftermath, the shift in spending toward services and away from goods last month hints at what next year might look like. 2022 could be when demand for services really drives spending, and demand for goods moves to the passenger seat, Justin Lahart writes. \n\n  United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are canceling dozens of flights over the holiday weekend as a surge of Covid-19 cases impacts crews . Alaska Air Group said it canceled 17 flights Thursday after some employees reported they may have been exposed to the virus, and said it may have to cut more. Other carriers have cautioned in recent days that there could be worker shortages that disrupt operations, as the Omicron variant races across the U.S., Alison Sider reports. \n\n  After nearly two years of dealing with worker shortages, pandemic restrictions and rising prices, many small businesses are suddenly facing a surge of employee illnesses from the Omicron variant that is leading to some hard choices . Calls mount to cut Covid-19 quarantine period for fully vaccinated . \n\n  Worker filings for unemployment benefits hovered near the lowest level in more than half a century last week as a strong labor market kept layoffs low . Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, were unchanged at 205,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists warn, however, that the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the U.S. could push layoffs higher in the weeks ahead, particularly in the services sector, as consumers adjust travel and entertainment plans to reduce the risk of getting sick, Harriet Torry reports. \n\n  Travelers looking to rent cars are encountering higher rates and few choices, if they can find a car at all. The shortage of rental cars that emerged earlier this year has gotten worse as companies such as Hertz Global Holdings struggle to restock their fleets after selling off big chunks early in the pandemic, analysts and executives say. Leisure travel has also bounced back with more Americans vaccinated and booking trips, further taxing already limited availability, Nora Naughton reports. \n\n  Schools face food shortages amid supply-chain disruptions . \n\n  U.S. inflation last month rose at the fastest pace since 1982. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased 5.7% from one year earlier in November. Excluding often volatile food and energy prices, core inflation was up 4.7%, the sharpest annual increase since 1989. The PCE price index, which tends to run a little cooler than the better-known consumer-price index, is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. The Fed targets 2% annual price increases. \n\n  Purchases of new single-family houses in the U.S. rose in November as demand remained robust despite high prices. The Commerce Department said new-home sales increased 12.4% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 744,000. One blemish on the report: October sales were revised sharply lower. And one sign of the times: The median price of a new home was $416,900 in November, a new record. This year for the first time monthly sales of new homes priced above $400,000 exceeded sales of those priced below $400,000. \n\n   Do They Know It's Christmas Time at All? \n\n  Streets have emptied and restaurants have closed in the U.K. as the Omicron variant breaks fresh records. Unlike previous lockdowns, however, there is no government mandate to stay home this time; people are hunkering down of their own accord , fearful of catching Covid-19 and being forced to spend Christmas in isolation. The cautious behavior is a blow for retailers and restaurants that had begun to recover from previous rounds of restrictions and were counting on strong trade over the festive period to see them through the coming months. It also highlights how voluntary responses to the virus can shape the trajectory of the pandemic and the approach of governments as they grapple with a new variant, Isabel Coles reports. \n\n   Turkey: What Could Possibly Go Wrong? \n\n  A new policy to relieve Turkey's currency crisis puts a spotlight on a historically robust area of the economy: the banks. Faith in the local banking system has remained resolute despite repeated currency depreciations, sackings of central bank chiefs and boom-bust cycles. The country's lenders are at the center of the government's rescue plan for the lira unveiled this week. The plan pays Turks to keep their bank deposits in lira and not pull money out of the banking system no matter what happens in currency markets. For now, the lira's selloff has calmed. But some are skeptical about the long-term prospects. Spiraling inflation and heavy dollarization in the banking system leave this major emerging market vulnerable, Caitlin Ostroff and Patricia Kowsmann report. \n\n    About Us \n\n  Real Time Economics comes to you from WSJ economics reporters and editors around the world.

Why Is Everybody So Glum? -- Barron&apos;s\n\nBy Ben Levisohn \n\n     Misery may love company, but this is getting ridiculous. \n\n     If all you had to ponder were the numbers, you would assume that everyone would have fond memories of 2021. Jobs were plentiful. Economic growth was the strongest it had been in decades, and stock returns were out of this world. It's the kind of data that would have been celebrated just a few years ago. \n\n     Despite the New Year, Americans aren't celebrating -- they're mostly miserable. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment dropped 13%, to 70.6, in 2021, the lowest end-of year reading since 2008, when the world was in the throes of the global financial crisis. Unlike that year, when the S&P 500 index dropped 38%, the index is up by more than 27%. That's the largest stock market gain in a year when sentiment suffered a double-digit drop in at least 25 years. It's the kind of agony expected from a bunch of teenagers at a Cure concert, but it's hard to blame people for their gloom. \n\n     Covid-19 was supposed to be long gone by this point, or at least that's what we'd hoped as 2021 got under way. But a combination of vaccine reluctance, virus mutations, and other factors has meant that not only is the virus still with us, but also that the U.S. is ending the year with a record number of cases -- a seven-day average of 277,741, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data -- and little sign that the Omicron spike will let up anytime soon. That the disease appears to have become less deadly as it has mutated is easy to overlook, though it shouldn't be. \n\n     \"The outlook for Omicron remains the same, as cases continue to break records globally, but the lack of [a] sharp increase in hospitalizations is allowing stocks to rally into year end,\" writes the Sevens Report's Tom Essaye. \n\n     Surging inflation has also been weighing on Americans. The Federal Reserve, after all, promised that rising prices would be \"transitory,\" and yet here we are at the end of the year with the consumer price index climbing at its fastest annual rate since 1982, and even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said it's time to retire the word. \n\n     In the latest University of Michigan report, a fourth of respondents cited a hit to their living standards due to inflation. \"The hope of a brief and fleeting spurt in prices has been dashed,\" writes Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. \"Inflation pressures have broadened behind the handful of pandemic reopening categories and intensified.\" \n\n     Still, it's rare to see such a disconnect between sentiment and the stock market. Since 1997, there have been 12 years of declining sentiment, with the S&P 500 finishing higher during seven of them. The decline in confidence during those years, however, was usually relatively small. The only year previous to 2020 when confidence suffered a double-digit decline and the market rose was in 2007, when a recession had already started, but the S&P 500 finished up 3%. Never has sentiment suffered double-digit declines for two years in a row only to see the S&P 500 rise by double digits in both years. \n\n     That suggests that perhaps there's a growing divide between what respondents say and what they do. Retail sales increased by 18.2% in November, year over year, while the most recent quits data from the Department of Labor was 2.8%, down from a record 3%, but still elevated. Even inflation might not be the problem that it appears to be, observes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Google searches for words like \"discount,\" \"cheap,\" and \"coupon\" are declining, not rising. \"[As] much as U.S. consumers may think about inflation (and numerous surveys show they clearly do), they are not yet responding to higher prices by seeking out better deals,\" he writes. \"This is good news for U.S. corporate earnings power, especially among larger companies that also enjoy economies of scale and scope.\" \n\n     Maybe so, but investors aren't feeling very good about the stock market either, despite -- or because of -- three consecutive years of double-digit gains. The latest American Association of Individual Investors sentiment survey shows that the percentage of bulls remained below 45% for a fifth straight week, despite the S&P 500 trading above its rising 50-day moving average, observes Sundial Capital Research's Jason Goepfert. When that has happened in the past, the S&P 500 has gone on to average a 4.6% gain over the next three months. \n\n     But just as consumers' pessimism isn't necessarily reflected in their actions, investors seem to be buying stocks despite a gloomy outlook -- and that should be good news for the market. \"The current low optimism, given a mostly healthy market environment, especially during this time of year, suggests higher prices,\" he writes. \n\n     Just don't expect it to be easy. \n\n     The Fed, after all, is cutting back its bond purchases, and the federal-fund futures market is pricing in a greater than 50% chance of a rate hike at the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. That's likely to inject a dose of volatility into the market. But with interest rates likely to remain below both the rate of inflation and the rate of economic growth, stocks should still be the place to be, writes Jefferies strategist Sean Darby, as long as the cost of credit relative to U.S. Treasuries doesn't get too expensive. \n\n     \"[Nominal] GDP will still be above government bond yields, ensuring equities outperform their peers, but a watchful eye on credit spreads will be the litmus test for owning the more challenging business models, \" he explains. \n\n     And if the market doesn't keep going up? At least investors will have something to be miserable about. \n\n     Write to Ben Levisohn at Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 31, 2021 21:30 ET (02:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269413Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:57:14.650577Z", "inner_id": 422, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5791, "annotations": [{"id": 6274, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "CjzQ_1PuzM", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T19:57:16.184134Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:58:56.483644Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 88.634, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "63e09a04-f772-404f-b567-a9b0184eb0c3", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5791, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "EUROPEAN MIDDAY BRIEFING - Stocks Rise on Final Day of Tumultuous Month\n\n  MARKET WRAPS \n\n  Stocks: \n\n  European stocks traded mostly higher after upbeat trading in Asia. \n\n  \"A decent start to the week for markets in Europe and Asia hopefully sets the tone for a better five-day trading session for investors, given the carnage we've seen for most of January,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \n\n  In the commodity space, crude prices continued their march higher, sitting at the highest levels since 2014. \n\n  \"There'll be a continued focus on the trajectory of oil prices over the week ahead, particularly with the OPEC+ group meeting on Wednesday to discuss a March production increase,\" said Reid. \"The geopolitical tensions out of Eastern Europe also helped drive oil prices higher, as Russia is one of the world's largest exporters.\" \n\n  Stocks to watch: LVMH's unmatched earnings give it scope for continued investment in the fast-changing luxury sector, Credit Suisse said after last week's expectation-beating 2021 results. \n\n  The French luxury goods major booked yearly operating profit of EUR17 billion, multiple times higher than what most peers can expect, and this looks sustainable as the core fashion division's high margins solidify, CS said. \n\n  This gives the group firepower for investment in product and marketing and to tap new sales opportunities, the bank added. Sales growth should normalize in 2022 as comparables get tougher, but should nevertheless reach double digits organically in the year, CS said, keeping an outperform rating on LVMH stock and raising its target to EUR800 from EUR720. \n\n  Low-cost carrier Ryanair's 3Q saw an improvement in pricing despite December's Omicron-related restrictions as its EUR25 average fare was only around 24% below 2019's 3Q, an improvement from the 31% difference in the 2Q comparison, Citi said. \n\n  However, pricing in 4Q would have been hurt by late Christmas and new year bookings and the Omicron coronavirus, the U.S. bank said. \n\n  Citi now expects net income loss for fiscal 2022 to be EUR366 million, compared with a prior net loss expectation of EUR367 million, with earnings estimates for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025 rising by more than 6%, 1%, and 4%, respectively, the bank said. Citi rates the stock buy with a EUR20 target price. \n\n  Pearson's acquisition of digital-credentialing firm Credly for a total firm value of $200 million is a sensible move and should be well received, Citi said. \n\n  The FTSE 100 education company's acquisition coherently expands its suite of services in what is currently an underscale professional learning operation, and at a group level it underlines the shift of emphasis away from higher education--something of a monomaniacal focus for the market, the U.S. bank said. \n\n  Pearson using its financial net cash position of around GBP200 million to accelerate its business mix shift also makes good financial sense, Citi added. Citi retains its buy rating on Pearson's stock. Shares are down 0.4% at 604.0 pence. \n\n  Data in focus: The absolute majority secured by the Portuguese socialist party, led by Prime Minister Antonio Costa, in Sunday's parliamentary election is likely to be positive for the country's economy, economists from Berenberg said. \n\n  Costa will now be able to pass the budget, and Portugal can begin to spend its 16.6 billion euros in EU recovery funds, which could lift the country's GDP be between 1.5% and 2.4% by 2026, they said. \n\n  Portugal's household median net income remains among the lowest in the eurozone, and Costa wants to increase income per worker, but will continue to safeguard the country's fiscal stability, Berenberg said. \"With largely sensible economic policies, Portugal can stay on a solid recovery track,\" the German bank said. \n\n  Germany's inflation is expected to ease to 4.7% on year in January, following a reading of 5.3% in December. This would be the first decline in the yearly rate since June 2021. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast German inflation at 4.3% in January. \n\n  One key driver of the deceleration is likely to have been the unwinding of the VAT effect that drove up inflation rates significantly last year, the Italian bank said. \n\n  \"A stronger deceleration is likely to have been prevented by energy companies passing on markedly higher electricity and natural-gas prices to consumers,\" UniCredit said. \n\n  Following the release of North-Rhine Westphalia's inflation data, which showed 5.1% inflation in January, UniCredit said the deceleration may be even more slight. \n\n  U.S. Markets: \n\n  Stock futures crept higher Monday, but major indexes are poised to close January with heavy losses following a month of volatile trading due to expected interest-rate increases. \n\n  \"There has been extreme volatility so far this year,\" said Louise Dudley, an equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. \"People are particularly worried with the interest-rate expectations continuing to get higher. We're definitely seeing from the U.S. that they're very on top of the inflation numbers-they're going to do everything they can.\" \n\n  Ms. Dudley said she expects that volatility will lessen as investors get more clarity over whether inflation has peaked and how companies expect to be impacted by higher prices for energy, labor and materials. Earnings are due ahead of Monday's market open from Otis Worldwide and L3Harris Technologies. \n\n  \"Companies are managing at the moment to hit their expectations, but it's the outlooks that have definitely got a big cautious question mark on them and people are worried about how much further some of these costs will go,\" she said. \n\n  In the week ahead, the U.S. jobs report Friday will be a highlight. The Fed is closely watching employment data as it considers higher inflation and monetary policy. \n\n  And with corporate earnings season in full swing, company results will also be in the spotlight. More than 110 constituents of the S&P 500 report this week, with NXP Semiconductors in the day ahead. Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Exxon Mobil, and General Motors, are among many other big names that will report in the coming days. \n\n  Forex: \n\n  The dollar was slightly lower after last week's rally but declines should remain limited due to speculation about the Fed tightening monetary policy at a faster pace, ING said. \n\n  \"Mild consolidation could see [the DXY dollar index] briefly break under 97.05 to the 96.85 area--that should hold, however,\" ING analysts said. \n\n  While most of this week's U.S. economic data for January could miss expectations, this weakness caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant is well understood by the market and investors are more influenced by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's \"very hawkish\" comments at last Wednesday's meeting, they said. \n\n  The Bank of England could raise interest rates further on Thursday but this might not lift sterling, RBC Capital Markets said. \n\n  The BOE is likely to raise its key rate 25 basis points to 0.50%, the level at which it plans to start reducing its stock of purchased assets, RBC currency strategist Adam Cole said. \n\n  \"The market is not currently appreciating how that interaction between Bank Rate and balance sheet reduction means this will not be a normal tightening cycle and that current pricing for Bank Rate is too aggressive,\" he said. That could weigh on sterling over the medium term, he said. \n\n  Short-sellers built bets against sterling in the week to Jan. 25 despite expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates again this Thursday, Rabobank said, citing the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \n\n  \"The money market has been positioned for a fair amount of tightening this year,\" Rabobank forex strategist Jane Foley said. \"That said, fears of a spike in the cost of living in the U.K. questions whether the BOE will be able to match these expectations.\" \n\n  Bitcoin was struggling to recover as it remains below the key $40,000 level but the weakness won't last, AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam said. \n\n  \"With mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies on the rise, by institutional investors and individuals alike, and backed by strong fundamentals, the future outlook of cryptocurrencies remains positive,\" he said. \n\n  Bitcoin falls 2.3% on the day to $37,213 but has recouped some of its losses since hitting a six-month low of $32,983 last Monday, according to CoinDesk. \n\n  Bonds: \n\n  The European Central Bank's rate decision on Thursday should be neutral for European credit markets, though inflation data due the day before could hurt market sentiment, UniCredit said. \n\n  \"While we expect that the ECB will not make any policy changes at the meeting, which should... be credit neutral, inflation concerns remain high and are likely to weigh on market sentiment,\" analysts at the bank said. They advise clients to stick to bonds maturing between three and five years to reduce price volatility. \n\n  The Bank of England may find itself, like the Fed last week, unable to rule out consecutive interest-rate rises this Thursday, Mizuho said. \"The message may be similar as that from the Fed,\" analysts said, adding that it will be difficult for BOE Governor Andrew Bailey to rule out hiking scenarios when the questions inevitably come. \n\n  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments signaling that the Fed could raise rates several times in consecutive months prompted investors to dump stocks and bonds. \n\n  The BOE is expected to lift the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% this Thursday, which would trigger a stop to the reinvestments of proceeds of maturing gilts and open the door to a further rate rise in March. \n\n  The Italian presidential election has resulted in the most market-friendly outcome, with Sergio Mattarella remaining president and Mario Draghi as prime minister, nonetheless, Italian risk premia is expected to widen moderately this year, Oliver Eichmann, head of rates for EMEA fixed income at DWS, said. \n\n  \"With a view to the further development of the risk premium on Italian government bonds, we nevertheless expect a moderate widening over a 12-month horizon,\" he said. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 31, 2022 06:19 ET (11:19 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269454Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:58:56.754879Z", "inner_id": 423, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5792, "annotations": [{"id": 6275, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "peCgTYvVG8", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T19:59:30.543485Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:59:30.543510Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 29.987, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "2616bb35-304c-4f97-a1b7-fa5836f13fda", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5792, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Rising Interest Rates Hit Municipal- Bonds Market -- WSJ\n\nBy Heather Gillers \n\n     Municipal bonds are off to their worst start since 2011. \n\n     The early-year bond rout has dragged returns on the S&P Municipal Bond Index to minus 1.1% through Jan. 20, counting price changes and interest payments. The loss is an early sign that rising interest rates could make 2022 rockier than last year, when federal stimulus and elevated demand from homebound savers led to record low volatility and historically high prices. \n\n     Now investors are eyeing those prices more warily. Muni bond mutual and exchange-traded funds took in a net $830 million through Jan. 19, compared with $6.1 billion last year, according to Refinitiv Lipper. After Fed officials indicated they could lift short-term rates sooner than expected, muni yields jumped alongside Treasury yields, with 10-year AAA muni yields rising to 1.28% Jan. 20 from 1.03% Dec. 30, according to Refinitiv Municipal Market Data. Yields rise as bond prices fall. \n\n     State and local governments issue long-term debt in the roughly $4 trillion muni market, typically for capital projects such as highways and schools. Affluent investors prize munis because most throw off interest that is exempt from federal, and often state, taxes. \n\n     But rising interest rates make outstanding bonds with comparatively lower yield less attractive, a worrisome possibility for anyone holding or buying muni debt. They also increase borrowing costs for state and local governments, whose tax-exempt borrowing fell to $9.2 billion this year through Jan. 20, a four-year low. The city of Greenwich, Conn., issued one-year debt at a net interest cost of 0.21% in the first week of January, up from 0.12% last January, according to Comptroller Peter Mynarski. \n\n     Some analysts also expect a drop off in demand for munis this year because of an anticipated slowdown in household savings, which increased during the pandemic, especially for the wealthy. \n\n     The appetite for tax-exempt debt has long exceeded yearly issuance. The imbalance grew over the past year as higher-income Americans moved savings and the windfalls they got from blockbuster stock gains into municipal bonds. Analysts don't expect those inflows to continue at the same pace this year. \n\n     Creditworthiness could become more of an issue for some struggling cities in 2022 as they continue to spend down waves of federal pandemic aid. That aid, as well as tax revenues from purchases made with stimulus checks and stimulus-fueled stock gains, helped strengthen municipal credit in 2021, when public-finance upgrades slightly outpaced downgrades by Fitch Ratings. In 2020, Fitch did 80% more downgrades than upgrades, as the pandemic shut down local economies and strained services. \n\n     Sustained inflation also could aggravate credit woes, because it would drive up the cost of government projects, services and cost-of-living adjusted retirement benefits, some analysts said. \n\n     \"How good is muni credit if the baseline of the budget has to go up 5%\" several years in a row? asked Adam Stern, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors. \"Some places can handle it, other places probably can't.\" \n\n     Default is extremely rare in the municipal market. But debt issued by strapped borrowers tends to fall in price under adverse financial conditions, driving down the value of investors' portfolios and creating a dilemma for those who want to cash out. \n\n     In some ways, the increased potential for volatility in 2022 marks a return to a more familiar investment environment after a year of unusual calm, which followed a year of Covid-related upheaval. After a liquidity crisis in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, the muni market in 2021 had a record 113 days when yields on AAA intermediate maturity bonds didn't change from the day before, according to data from Municipal Market Analytics. \n\n     The year \"2020 was abnormal in terms of volatility,\" said Michael Zezas, municipal strategist and head of U.S. public policy research at Morgan Stanley. \"2021 was abnormally calm. This is a return to normal.\" \n\n     Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 23, 2022 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269485Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T19:59:30.756869Z", "inner_id": 424, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5793, "annotations": [{"id": 6276, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "aauwyie6PK", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:00:35.408861Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:00:35.408896Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-04T20:00:29.423101Z", "lead_time": 63.915, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "0b872bb7-0ea2-4d20-b83f-f34d128a5924", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5793, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Nasdaq Hits Correction Territory -- WSJ\n\n  S&P 500 and Dow lose 1% as investors adjust portfolios for higher interest rates \n\nBy Gunjan Banerji and Joe Wallace \n\n     U.S. stocks gave up early gains and turned lower, extending a recent stretch of losses that have pulled major indexes down to start the year. \n\n     The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 166.64 points, or 1.1%, to 14340.26. It finished the day 10.7% below its all-time closing high, set in November. A decline of greater than 10% is considered a correction for a stock index. \n\n     The S&P 500 fell 44.35 points, or 1%, to 4532.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 339.82 points, or 1%, to 35028.65. \n\n     Wednesday's trading activity continued a tumultuous stretch for major indexes, with stocks paring their earlier gains and closing near session lows. In the first weeks of January, many investors have started dumping shares of technology companies and piling into other corners of the market in anticipation of rising interest rates. Some investors are positioning for the Covid-19 pandemic to turn into an endemic. \n\n     Investors have stepped up bets that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks will tighten monetary policy in the coming months, withdrawing a pillar of support for markets. Mounting expectations of interest-rate rises follow evidence that the drivers of inflation have broadened beyond the supply-chain shock that fueled price gains for much of 2021. \n\n     That has led to big swings, leaving many stocks in a bear market and stoking giant rotations among different sectors. \n\n     Recent volatility is  \"really all about inflation and how aggressive central banks are going to be to counteract it,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Asset Management, adding that inflation could also curtail economic growth by knocking consumption. \"Certainly, the market is nervous at the moment,\" he said. \n\n     Government-bond prices edged up Wednesday, pushing down yields. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.826% from 1.866% Tuesday, which was their highest level since January 2020. Yields on interest-rate-sensitive two-year notes were down to 1.022% from 1.038% Tuesday. \n\n     The moves in the bond market have rippled through stocks, and particularly the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite is down 8% this year, a much sharper decline than the S&P or Dow industrials. \n\n     \"There is currently a knee-jerk reaction occurring in the market\" in response to rising bond yields, said Dev Kantesaria, founder of Valley Forge Capital. \n\n     And there are signs that individual investors -- a key force behind 2021's stock-market rally -- are cooling on tech, according to analysts at Vanda Research. Retail investors have been buying shares of financials and energy companies, while their purchases of highflying stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia have been dwindling, Vanda said. \n\n     Other corners of the market have staged a strong rally. The S&P 500's value index has been outperforming its growth index by around 7.4 percentage points this month, on pace for the biggest monthly outperformance since December 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data. \n\n     Some of the biggest lenders in the U.S. reported rising earnings. Bank of America shares rose 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $46.44 after the lender reported a jump in fourth-quarter profits. Morgan Stanley's shares gained $1.72, or 1.8%, to $95.73, after profits that topped forecasts. \n\n     U.S. Bancorp fell almost 8% after the bank holding company posted a rise in compensation costs. This earnings season, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have also reported shelling out more in compensation. \n\n     Procter & Gamble said consumers were undeterred by higher prices, leading to higher revenue and lifting shares of the consumer-goods company around 3.4%. \n\n     Over the next week, investors will be parsing earnings from big tech companies including Netflix and Microsoft. Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., said he'll be closely tracking the results to see what guidance executives provide for future quarters. \n\n     \"I'm hoping for them to not come out and guide lower,\" Mr. Morgan said. \n\n     Elsewhere, Europe's most closely watched government-bond yield turned positive for the first time since 2019. The yield on 10-year German bund rose as high as 0.021% Wednesday after trading in negative territory for over 30 months. \n\n     Oil prices rose. Brent crude futures rose 1.1% to $88.44, hitting the highest level since October 2014. Wednesday's moves extend a rally driven in part by the potential for supply disruptions in Russia and the Middle East. \n\n     Overseas stock markets were mixed following Tuesday's selloff on Wall Street. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2%. Asian stocks came under pressure, with Japan's Nikkei 225 skidding 2.8%.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a rise to minus 6.4 points. \n\n  GfK uses data from three subindexes from the current month to derive a sentiment figure for the coming month, measuring consumers' economic expectations, income expectations and propensity to buy. In February, there was a mixed picture: While economic expectations increased somewhat, income expectations and the propensity to buy had losses compared with the previous month. \n\n  Economic expectations rose to 24.1 in February from 22.8 in January. The outlook for the coming months is quite positive as it was recently decided to lift pandemic restrictions, GfK said. \n\n  \"This gives cause for hope that consumer spending will also return as a result,\" Mr. Buerkl said. \n\n  However, the income expectations indicator dropped to 3.9 in February from 16.9 in January, the lowest value in over a year, according to GfK. \n\n  Inflation is the greatest current threat to income expectations as high prices for energy and food are weakening purchasing power, the market-research group said. \n\n  Propensity to buy fell to 1.4 in February from 5.2 in January, GfK's data showed. \n\n  \"Despite the current decline in propensity to buy, the future expectations for a recovery of consumer sentiment are quite favorable,\" GfK said. \n\n \n\n  Write to Maria Martinez at maria.martinez@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 23, 2022 02:00 ET (07:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269586Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T18:09:11.280601Z", "inner_id": 427, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5796, "annotations": [{"id": 6279, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "dJ2Gniwm6n", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:10:38.070608Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:10:38.070634Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 559.985, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d784b11f-40f4-4f87-8cb3-ef2f1a236ffc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5796, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "EMEA Morning Briefing: Stocks to Track Global -2-\n\n  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said Tuesday he is on board with a rate rise next month but is leaning against a supersize move up in the central bank's now near-zero short-term rate target. \n\n  \"I would be supportive of a 25 basis-point increase in March,\" Mr. Harker said in a Bloomberg television interview. \"Could we do 50 [basis points]?

That was a nearly $7 trillion increase from late January 2020, just before the pandemic hit the U.S. economy. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  For Markets, the January Selloff Marks the End of the Pandemic \n\n  To look at stock valuations, the pandemic might never have happened. \n\n  On Monday, the U.S. market closed its worst month since March 2020, with the S&P 500 falling 5.3%. The index has now lost all of its price gains since mid-October. The technology-heavy Nasdaq has retreated further, because the sectors that have performed worse are those more affected by higher interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has said will be a reality this year. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Coffee Prices Climb, Pushed Up by Bad Weather and Supply-Chain Woes \n\n  Higher prices are here for your morning cup of joe. \n\n  First the drought came to Brazil, then the frost, roiling the world's top coffee-growing region during the pandemic. Arabica coffee prices at one point last year were nearly twice their levels at the end of 2020. Investors are betting those weather effects, along with supply-chain snarls, will keep prices elevated in 2022. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.S. Job Openings, Quits Remained Elevated at End of Last Year \n\n  The U.S. labor market remained tight at the end of last year with job openings and worker turnover hovering near the highest levels on record, though there are signs demand cooled as the Omicron variant disrupted the economy in January. \n\n  The Labor Department on Tuesday said there were 10.9 million job openings in December, up slightly from 10.8 million the previous month. Meanwhile, the number of times workers quit fell to 4.3 million in December, from a record 4.5 million. Hiring slowed to 6.3 million, down from 6.6 million. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.K. Retail Prices Rose at Nearly Double the Pace in January \n\n  U.K. retail prices grew at nearly double the pace in January as the previous month, according to the latest report by the British Retail Consortium and NielsenIQ. \n\n  Retail prices rose 1.5% on year in January after climbing 0.8% in December, marked by a significant increase in nonfood prices. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Exxon, Chevron Hit Gushers of Cash as Big Oil Companies Lure Back Investors \n\n  The world's big Western oil companies are back in the money and once again attracting strong interest from investors as crude prices rise to their highest levels in years. \n\n  Exxon Mobil Corp. on Tuesday reported $23 billion in profit for 2021, its highest total since 2014, including $8.9 billion in profit in the fourth quarter. Last week, Chevron Corp. reported its most profitable year since 2014, earning $15.6 billion in net income in 2021 and $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter. The largest European oil companies, Shell PLC and BP PLC, are expected to also post resurgent annual results when they report in the coming days. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Putin Says West 'Basically Ignored' His Demands in Ukraine Standoff \n\n  KYIV, Ukraine-President Vladimir Putin of Russia said the U.S. and its European allies had \"basically ignored\" Moscow's demands for security assurances but expressed a willingness to continue talks as Russian troops maneuvered near Ukraine's borders and Kyiv rushed to bolster its defenses. \n\n  \"We didn't see an adequate response to our key concerns,\" Mr. Putin told reporters Tuesday at a Kremlin press conference at which he again castigated the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for what he has portrayed as a persistent eastward push that threatens Moscow. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Google Parent Caps Blockbuster Year With Sales Gains \n\n  Google parent Alphabet Inc. posted another quarter of strong sales growth, capping a year when profit nearly doubled despite mounting regulatory pressure that threatens the search giant's future. \n\n  The company's dominance in online search, video and internet ad sales made it one of last year's leading beneficiaries of an upswing in digital advertising.

In threatening those flows Moscow risks disrupting supplies to China while setting off a scramble among customers in fragile Middle Eastern economies at a time when food inflation is already high. \n\n     Missiles and airstrikes have battered cities throughout Ukraine, including port cities key to the country's agricultural exports. Commercial shipping in and out of the country has largely ground to a halt. \n\n     An ocean vessel chartered by one of the world's largest food suppliers, Cargill Inc., was hit by a projectile off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday. Minnesota-based Cargill, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is seaworthy and no one was injured. \n\n     U.S. grains giants have also begun closing operations. Archer Daniels Midland Co. closed its facilities in Ukraine, which include a grain terminal at a port near Odessa. Bunge Ltd. also closed its offices and facilities in Ukraine. \n\n     Wheat futures traded in Chicago have jumped almost 12% so far this week, hitting their highest level since July 2012. European wheat prices have soared 15% for the week. \n\n     Russia's incursions in the south and in the east strike at the heart of Ukraine's most productive wheat-growing regions, which stretch across the country's southern half, from Kharkiv on the eastern border with Russia to Odessa on the country's Black Sea coastline. \n\n     The fighting shouldn't have much impact on the planting or harvesting of crops, according to Mike Lee, owner of Green Square Agro Consulting, a crop forecasting company that specializes in the Black Sea region. Wheat, for instance, is planted in September and October and harvested in July and the following months. \n\n     \"Whatever happens, there is a crop in the ground,\" he said. \n\n     Still, if the situation on the ground escalates to a position where farmers can't apply pesticides or fertilizers to their wheat, which will start in March, that could reduce the yield by up to a third, presuming they can harvest in July, Mr. Lee said. \n\n     While a large portion of crops are exported around the time they are harvested, cargoes will leave Ukraine throughout the year, he said. Over 700,000 metric tons of wheat are exported during each of the months of February, March and April, according to government statistics. That is well below the 3.64 million and 4.5 million tons exported in August and September respectively, but enough to disturb crop supply chains. Damaged infrastructure and port congestion could also affect trading well into the year. \n\n     Shipping in the Azov Sea -- an extension of the Black Sea to the east of Crimea -- has stopped. Ships are banned from passing through the narrow Kerch Strait into the shallow sea, and ship-tracking data showed dozens of ships, including the bulk carriers that transport grains, had anchored in the strait. \n\n     Russian and Ukrainian ports on the Azov Sea export up to 18 million tons of grains each year, said Andrey Sizov, managing director of SovEcon, a Russian research firm focusing on Black Sea grains. \n\n     Damage to port infrastructure or a Russian naval blockade would also threaten the much larger Ukrainian ports around Odessa and Mykolaiv. Ports around the two cities handle upward of 50 million metric tons of grain each year and are crucial to Ukraine's agricultural industry, said Mr. Sizov. \n\n     Simon Arnold, co-founder of Dubai-based Aria Commodities, said his trading firm would hold off from trading grains in Ukraine for at least a month or until the situation appears resolved. \n\n     Disruptions to Ukraine's grain trade will also be difficult for its main customers, as the world already swallows food-price inflation. \n\n     Beijing has made Ukraine a centerpiece of its efforts to diversify grain supplies and increase food security. Chinese demand for corn is at a record high after Beijing encouraged domestic producers to pile into hog production. \n\n     Ukraine exported a record 8.2 million tons of corn to China in 2021, making up nearly 30% of total Chinese corn imports. Ukraine accounted for as much as 86% of Chinese corn imports in 2019. Ukraine also exports barley and sunflower oil to China. \n\n     Disruptions to Ukrainian corn exports come at an especially difficult time for Chinese pork producers, who have been losing money as hog prices drop. \n\n     Egypt and Indonesia are the largest buyers of Ukrainian wheat, each accounting for more than 15% of Ukraine's wheat imports, or more than 3 million tons, according to data from Trade Data Monitor. Other major buyers are Turkey and Pakistan, which each imported 1.7 million and 1.3 million tons of wheat, respectively, from Ukraine in 2021. \n\n     For Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, access to affordable wheat is a question of political stability. Rallying prices have led to street protests, including ones in 2011 during the Arab Spring, which toppled the government of Hosni Mubarak. \n\n     On Thursday, Egypt canceled an international tender to buy wheat after receiving just one bid amid the uncertainty surrounding Black Sea grains supplies. Egypt's import agency typically receives between 10 and 20 bids in its closely watched tenders. \n\n     For Ukraine itself, the agricultural sector is one of the key bright spots of its economy. The yellow in the country's flag symbolizes its crop fields. \n\n     Any disruption to its grains trade will be painful. With more than 41 million hectares of agricultural land, covering 70% of the country, agriculture is Ukraine's largest export and the largest part of its economy, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year, according to the country's statistics service. \n\n     Last year the Ukrainian government changed its laws to allow hundreds of thousands of small and medium-size farmers to buy and sell land. That allowed them to borrow money on the land they had, and invest those proceeds. \n\n     The U.S. and European governments had already zeroed in on agriculture as a way to develop the Ukrainian economy. The U.S. Agency for International Development, for instance, says it has provided around $13 million since late 2019 to support the passage of these laws and educate farmers in how to take advantage of the changes. \n\n     Even before the invasion, geopolitical tensions were putting pressure on Ukrainian farmers. \n\n     Larissa Boden, whose business Agro-focus Ltd was planting its next crop of asparagus last week, has seen a 30% increase in the price of fuel. A bank that Agro-focus, the country's largest asparagus farmer, had been negotiating a loan with has now put those talks on hold. Ms. Boden, who farms in the south close to Crimea, was also concerned that war would mean the seasonal workers farms depend upon would leave to work in more stable countries. \n\n     On Thursday, after hearing explosions in the early morning, she said she stayed indoors and off her fields. \n\n     Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com, Alistair MacDonald at Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com and Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 25, 2022 09:07 ET (14:07 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269659Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:11:05.054046Z", "inner_id": 429, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5798, "annotations": [{"id": 6281, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "OYtazaEuzw", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:11:41.696855Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:11:41.696889Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 35.896, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "6cd39cca-9699-4a35-a9ce-df5e01a24689", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5798, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Tech Trader: DoorDash Delivered The Biggest Surprise Of Earnings Season -- Barron&apos;s\n\nBy Eric J. Savitz \n\n     As the world emerges from the pandemic, tech investors have been struggling to answer a fundamental question: Which consumer behaviors developed over the past two years will stick -- and which will prove to have been fleeting Covid-era trends? The back and forth has played out throughout earnings season, from Peloton and Netflix's disappointments to Microsoft and Apple's home runs. \n\n     The bottom line is that no one's going back to 2019 patterns; we're all shaping a new normal. Working from home is no longer a temporary measure -- the phenomenon is changing the labor force. (I put more miles on my road bike last year than on my car and suspect I will do the same in 2022.) Business travel appears permanently reduced, with some meetings and trade events likely to remain online, where costs are lower and access is higher. \n\n     While weeks of earnings reports have generally created more questions than answers, this past week brought one bit of clarity: Results from DoorDash (ticker: DASH) showed that food delivery is one pandemic habit that's likely to stick. \n\n     To be clear, the stock market is littered with reopening casualties, and DoorDash hasn't been immune from the downdraft. \n\n     With interest rates on the rise, investors have steered away from companies with high multiples and a lack of profits. Wall Street has dealt especially severe punishment to any company coping with postpandemic slowdowns. \n\n     Zoom Video Communications (ZM) hit a 52-week low this past week. The stock has now essentially erased its Covid-era rally, falling more than 75% from an October 2020 peak. \n\n     Shares of Shopify (SHOP), the e-commerce software pioneer, continued to fall this past week after executives offered cautious commentary about the business amid inflation worries and product shortages. There are also signs that people are going back to physical stores for at least some purchases. Shopify shares lost 23% on the week, extending their slide to 60% since a November peak. \n\n     DocuSign (DOCU) is down 63% from its pandemic peak because of slowing growth in its e-signature business, while video-tools provider Vimeo (VMEO) is down 77% since spinning off from IAC/Interactive (IACI) last May. Even Netflix (NFLX), a winner long before the pandemic, hasn't been immune. Shares of the streaming pioneer are off 44% on slowing subscriber growth. \n\n     So, the idea that food delivery would be one of the lasting winners from the pandemic is a bit surprising -- and the volatility in DoorDash stock suggests that skepticism remained high heading into earnings. DoorDash came public in December 2020, smack in the middle of the pandemic. The company's initial public offering priced at $102 a share, opened at $182, and closed that first day at $189.51. But the stock got caught in the recent tech downdraft, plunging more than 60% from its November 2021 peak of $245, to a recent price around $96. \n\n     Last week's earnings report provided some positive signals. Revenue for the December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter were both a bit ahead of Wall Street estimates, and there was especially encouraging user data. Monthly average users in the quarter grew 22% from a year ago, to a record 25 million. Total orders were up 35% to 369 million, and gross order volume was 36% higher at $11.2 billion. \n\n     In a research note, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted that DoorDash accounts for just 5% of U.S. restaurant industry sales, with those 25 million people accounting for a single-digit percentage of the population. Fitzgerald, who has an Overweight rating and $170 target on the stock, sees \"plenty of runway\" ahead, with new growth opportunities in advertising, international markets, and delivery of goods beyond restaurant meals. \n\n     The company is also making a growing push to turn meal delivery into a habit. The company has more than 10 million members for its DashPass plan, up by a million members in the latest quarter. \n\n     The program has an Amazon Prime--like effect on DoorDash's business -- members are more loyal and tend to order more meals. DoorDash is pursuing partnerships with corporate accounts to make DashPass an employee perk -- News Corp, the parent company of Barron's publisher Dow Jones, now offers free DashPass membership to employees. \n\n     Robert Mollins, an analyst at Gordon Haskett and another DoorDash bull, writes that investors were worried about tough comparisons heading into the quarter, along with Uber's (UBER) recent comment that it had gained market share in food delivery. \n\n     DoorDash deflected all of those concerns with its strong results, impressive guidance, and market-share gains of its own. Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney, another DoorDash bull, thinks the market may be consolidating into two market leaders -- Uber Eats and DoorDash. \n\n     So, is DoorDash now a bargain? Wall Street certainly thinks so -- the average analyst target is about twice the current stock price. While still generating losses, DoorDash expects to turn profitable in 2023. \n\n     Meanwhile, the stock now trades for a relatively modest fives times estimated 2023 sales, which is about in line with Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), and cheaper than the seven times you'll pay for the wizard of burgertech, McDonald's (MCD). Risks remain -- and Uber is cheaper still, at a little over two times sales -- but the food-delivery business is just getting going. \n\n     Write to Eric J.

Like other farmers across Ukraine, his crop for this year is also imperiled. \n\n     Global concerns that Russia's invasion would curtail Ukraine's 2022 harvest have come to fruition. The crop shortfall will extend to the many countries that rely on Ukraine for wheat, corn and cooking oil. \n\n     With wheat already in the ground, and only a few weeks left to plant corn, farmers in Ukraine can't get needed fertilizers and chemicals. They are low on fuel for tractors and other farm equipment. Workers are quitting to join the fight or to leave the country, leaving farms short-handed. \n\n     Mr. Borisov said he and other farmers need to start their corn, sunflower and barley crops in April and May. That is now in doubt, and the impact on food supplies and prices will be felt world-wide. \n\n     \"We hope we will plant, and we want to plant, but the situation is totally unpredictable,\" Mr. Borisov said. \"You cannot build a forecast on Vladimir Putin.\" \n\n     Ukraine's nutrient-rich soils yield 10% of global wheat exports, 14% of corn exports and about half of the world's sunflower oil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In just three weeks, war disrupted Ukraine agriculture, triggering higher prices as well as the threat of global shortages. Much of the exports go to developing economies already struggling with food-cost inflation. \n\n     Mr. Borisov's farm is close to the border with Russia, in an area that was overrun on the first day of fighting. He had been away when the Russians invaded. His parents, who live close to his farm, called him to say hundreds of tanks were moving past the fields. \n\n     Russia's naval blockade and fighting around Ukraine ports has all but stopped maritime shipping and left limited means for transporting goods. Wheat prices have hit record levels over the effect on Ukrainian and Russian shipments. \n\n     Like Ukraine's military efforts, the country's agriculture sector is rallying. Exports are being rerouted, and Ukraine is asking the U.S., Poland, France and others for supplies, said Taras Vysotskyi, Ukraine's deputy minister of agrarian policy and food. In the best case scenario, the country's agricultural exports will fall by a fifth this year compared with 2021, he said, but a much bigger drop is more likely. \n\n     Should Russian forces leave immediately, Dmitry Skorniakov said, his four farms would still struggle to resume work. Tractors, chemical sprayers and a grain silo were destroyed on one farm located close to the besieged city of Mariupol, he said. Some of his workers have left to join the country's defense. \n\n     Further along the Black Sea coast, Larissa Boden's asparagus farm, Ukraine's largest, is in territory now held by Russia. Neighboring farms in what is one of Ukraine's most important growing regions have had fields chewed up by tanks and artillery fire, she said. \n\n     Ms. Boden planned to take delivery of 340,000 asparagus crowns from the Netherlands to plant more crops by April. She made a down payment of EUR78,000, about $85,500. After the invasion, she canceled the order and asked the supplier to try to sell them elsewhere. \n\n     Like Mr. Skorniakov, she fears she won't have enough workers. \"We don't have people,\" Ms. Boden said, \"we have tanks.\" \n\n     The government of Ukraine, whose flag is said to depict a blue sky over a yellow field, has made farmworkers largely exempt from conscripted military service. Many are joining anyway. \n\n     Even on Mr. Skorniakov's farm near the comparatively peaceful border with Poland, his remaining farm hands are able to do less than 60% of the work, he said. Fertilizers and chemicals haven't been delivered, Mr. Skorniakov said. Fuel he typically buys from Russia and Belarus is unattainable. \n\n     \"It's a disaster,\" he said. \n\n     On track \n\n     Ukraine is the world's fourth and fifth largest exporter of corn and wheat, respectively, according to the USDA, and 85% of its crop exports travel by sea, said Mr. Vysotskyi, the government minister. \n\n     With ports closed, the country is trying to shift some exports through its Western borders. Around 25% to 30% are now heading to Romania, Poland and Slovakia by train and on to other ports, Mr. Vysotskyi said. \n\n     It is an imperfect solution. Ukraine's railways don't accommodate as high a volume of crops as ports can, and grains must be transferred to different train cars at the border because Ukraine's Soviet-era railways use a different gauge than those in the European Union. The shipping detours will add 10% to 15% to the cost of crops, Mr. Vysotskyi said. \n\n     The war in Ukraine is inflating global food prices that are already at decade highs, largely from the pandemic's lingering supply-chain troubles. Wheat futures are up 42% so far this year; the price of corn has risen 27%. \n\n     Worsening food supply prospects, Russia, also a major grain exporter, is struggling to get its crops out of the Black Sea. JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimated a decline of 60% in Russian grain shipments in the second week of March compared with the typical volume for that period in past years. \n\n     Grain is used for animal feed, and the supply interruptions have already hit the meat industry. \"We are seeing massive increases in the price of milk and meat, and this is not short-term,\" said Chris Elliott, a professor and expert on international food supply chains at Queens University, Belfast. \n\n     New bounty \n\n     Over the past two decades, the world's wheat trade has almost doubled, in large part because of stepped-up exports from Ukraine and Russia, according to the Agricultural Market Information System, a Group of 20 global food policy initiative. As recently as 15 years ago, Ukraine's grain exports were less than 7% of the country's 2020 total, according to government statistics. \n\n     An estimated 25 countries source at least half of their supplies from the two countries, according to AMIS. \"It is obviously disconcerting that some countries rely so strongly on Russia and or Ukraine for their wheat supplies,\" said Denis Drechsler, a project manager for the group. \n\n     Today, more than 41 million hectares of agricultural land cover 70% of Ukraine. Agriculture is the largest part of the Ukrainian economy, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year. \n\n     It wasn't always that way. When Kees Huizinga arrived in Ukraine 20 years ago, straight from Dutch agriculture college, he saw potential in the country's many abandoned fields. \n\n     Mr. Huizinga farms wheat, barley and sugar beet, and raises livestock in central Ukraine. Three weeks ago, he paid the equivalent of 80 cents for a liter of gas. Now, it is $1.65, he said, \"If you can even get your hands on it.\" \n\n     Mr. Huizinga said he needs to plant his corn within three weeks. His farm has enough fuel for maybe three-quarters of a regular crop. The shortage of chemicals and fertilizers also will diminish crop yields, he said. \n\n     Farmers reported having, on average, only 20% of the fuel they needed, according to an online government poll of 1,700 farmers, who represented 15% of Ukraine's arable land. \n\n     At around 5 a.m. on Feb. 24, the first day of the Russian invasion, Mr. Huizinga said he heard what sounded like a jet fighter flying high above his farm.

If sustained, that investment boom could boost productivity and living standards and counteract inflation pressure. \n\n     Private nonresidential business investment grew 7.4% in 2021 from the previous year after adjusting for inflation, the fastest pace since 2012 and a strong bounceback from the 5.3% decline in 2020. \n\n     Spending for software and information-processing equipment such as computers rose 14% in 2021 from the previous year. Since the first quarter of 2020, when Covid-19 began spreading rapidly in the U.S., those categories have grown vastly more than others, such as buildings, for which there is less need as work is increasingly done remotely. \n\n     Business spending will likely stay strong this year. Manufacturing firms surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management plan to raise capital expenditures by 7.7% in nominal terms in 2022. Service firms expect a 10.3% increase. \n\n     The new investment has contributed to an uptick in productivity by making workers more efficient. Productivity, which measures workers' output per hour worked, grew an average 2.2% a year in 2020 and 2021, up from a 0.9% average between 2011 and 2019, before the pandemic. \n\n     A more productive economy can produce more goods and services with the same number of hours worked. Over time that could raise workers' wages without pushing up inflation. \n\n     Robert Rosener, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said the uptick in capital spending \"is one area that stands out as a significant bright spot for economic growth in the longer term.\" \n\n     In particular, new technology spending could occur in nontech sectors, such as retail trade, spreading productivity gains more widely, he said. About three-quarters of retail executives surveyed by Morgan Stanley last year said they intend to increase spending on information technology, up from 21% in 2019. \n\n     One driver of the push toward technology is a labor shortage that has executives struggling to recruit and retain employees. In December 2021 the U.S. labor force was about 1.4% smaller than in February 2020, before the pandemic became widespread in the U.S. Economic output, on the other hand, was 4.5% higher in the fourth quarter of last year than in the first quarter of 2020, after adjusting for inflation. \n\n     Brian Niccol, chief executive at burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., told investors in a February earnings call that the company has been struggling to recruit and is looking at automating some more tedious tasks. \n\n     \"How do we get rid of the jobs people frankly don't love doing?\" he said. \"If there was a way to cut and core the avocados so that all our team member has to do is mash and add the salt, add the lime, add the onions, that would make their job so much better.\" \n\n     Walmart Inc., the country's largest employer, announced last year it would bring robots to 25 of its 42 regional distribution centers at a time when retailers nationwide have had trouble staffing warehouses. The company separately said last year it was looking to hire 20,000 permanent workers for its supply-chain operations and has boosted pay and bonuses. \n\n     Another driver is the move to remote work for legions of white-collar workers whose offices were shut down at the height of the pandemic. Firms have invested in online tools and software to allow their employees to work from home. \n\n     DocuSign Inc., which makes e-signature software saw a \"dramatic acceleration of purchases\" early in the pandemic, said CEO Daniel Springer, in a March 10 earnings call. The company's revenue grew 45% in its latest fiscal year, he said. \n\n     \"As the pandemic subsides and people begin to return to the office, they are not returning to paper,\" he said. \"E-signature is here to stay.\" \n\n     Research by Jose Maria Barrero of the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago has found that many workers will continue working from home once the pandemic is over. About 20% of workdays will be at home post-pandemic versus 5% before the pandemic, they estimate. \n\n     That will boost productivity by about 1% using the Labor Department's measure, they estimate. At-home workers are more productive, they found, in part because they are spared office distractions. \n\n     Still, it is hard to predict how the rise in capital expenditures and remote work will affect productivity in the long run. Even in normal times, productivity is difficult to capture accurately. Pandemic-related disruptions, such as mass layoffs and rapid hiring in a relatively short amount of time, might have muddied the statistics further. \n\n     \"My best guess is it's probably a small positive,\" said Mr. Bloom. \n\n     Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, sees reasons to be both optimistic and pessimistic about future productivity growth. On the one hand, the increase in business spending suggests \"more automation and productivity-enhancing replacement of workers by machines,\" he said in an email. \n\n     On the other, Mr. Gordon's research suggests that much of the recent rise in productivity comes from industries such as finance or professional services, where a significant number of employees have been working remotely. \n\n     \"To the extent that this shift from office to at-home work is temporary, so is the productivity-growth revival,\" he said. \n\n     Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 27, 2022 10:00 ET (14:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269797Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:14:02.587088Z", "inner_id": 433, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5802, "annotations": [{"id": 6285, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "dIPGjhjbbP", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:14:20.123141Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:14:20.123166Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 16.801, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3942a745-33e7-42ec-90c5-090017377904", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5802, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "European Currencies Hit Multiyear Lows As Energy Concerns Prompt Flight to Dollar\n\n  By Caitlin Ostroff \n\n \n\n  European currencies fell against the dollar Monday as investors worried that a potential crackdown on Russian energy imports by the U.S. and its allies would hurt economic growth in the region. \n\n  The euro fell 0.6% to $1.0866, its lowest level since May 2020, according to FactSet.

That is a slight decline from the number the government reported in January but remains a historically high figure. \n\n     Strong demand for workers is a key factor pushing up wages and inflation in the current U.S. labor market, despite economic uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\n     The Labor Department is set to release estimates on Tuesday at 10 a.m. of February job openings and the number of people who left their positions voluntarily. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the figures inched lower last month. The government data lag behind private-sector data by about a month. \n\n     Job openings soared in 2021 to a record 11.4 million in December, according to the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the number of times workers quit their jobs also soared, reaching a peak toward the end of last year. \n\n     The gap between the level of openings and the number of people who are unemployed and actively seeking work has persisted for several months. \n\n     \"Demand for labor is still incredibly high, but there's also progress happening, and we are on track to getting back to a pre-pandemic labor market based on many metrics by this year, potentially,\" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed. \n\n     Mr. Bunker said that the tightness in the labor market has already reduced in some sectors of the economy such as leisure and hospitality. He said this can be seen through quits trending down and wage growth cooling. \n\n     The average hourly pay for private-sector workers rose by just a penny in February, after growing by at least a dime a month over the last several months, and quits have been declining since peaking in November. \n\n     Hiring might get easier this year as more people seek jobs, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. \n\n     \"A lot of government support that was helping people out is over -- the government cheese isn't coming anymore. They'll need to work in order to support themselves,\" Mr. Shapiro said. \"And kids are back in school, so parents don't have to worry about what to do with their kids.\" \n\n     The U.S. labor market still faces the challenge of elevated inflation, which rose 7.9% year-over-year in February, the highest in 40 years. \n\n     \"Everybody's reading about a high rate of inflation. They are seeing it at the gas pump, they are seeing it in the grocery stores, so that can cause employee demand for higher wage increases to kick up,\" said Patricia Buckley, managing director for economics at professional-services company Deloitte. \n\n     While consumers' expectations for inflation can affect wages, higher inflation can also lower demand for certain goods and services -- potentially also reducing some employers' demand for workers, Ms. Buckley said. \n\n     Because of higher costs, Michelle Pusateri, owner of Nana Joes Granola, a granola company in San Francisco, said she has tried to find ways to meet consumer demand without having to add more workers as she looks to minimize costs. \n\n     \"We have been looking at increasing efficiencies through automation, which would mean not having to hire more people,\" Ms. Pusateri said, citing the packaging process as one area of focus. \n\n     Write to Bryan Mena at bryan.mena@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 29, 2022 05:30 ET (09:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269856Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:32:08.516890Z", "inner_id": 435, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5804, "annotations": [{"id": 6287, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "tlPKaUcKZL", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:32:34.071008Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:32:34.071033Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 24.778, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "68302cf3-f4f5-4eb0-954e-07e851ae97d1", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5804, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "New Hope Swings to 1H Profit, Pays Special Dividend on Strong Coal Prices\n\n \n   By Rhiannon Hoyle \n \n\n  Australian coal miner New Hope Corp. said it returned to first-half profit and declared a special dividend after benefiting from a jump in commodity prices. \n\n  The company reported a net profit of 330.4 million Australian dollars (US$244 million) for the six months through January.

In my judgment, the economy is resilient, it can handle these adjustments.\" \n\n     Ms. Daly isn't a voting member of the rate setting FOMC this year.

She also said that while she sees a robust pace of rate rises coming, markets have gone a long way toward pricing that, and rate increases, coupled with looming cuts in the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet, are unlikely to shock the economy. \n\n     After the Fed reaches a neutral stance for monetary policy, Ms. Daly said officials can then take stock if they need to go further. Ms. Daly said the U.S. economy is in good shape and she doesn't expect Fed actions to cause a recession, although she acknowledged there is much uncertainty given the continuing pandemic and Russia's war on Ukraine. \n\n     \"There are, of course, no guarantees when it comes to a highly uncertain and fast-moving economy,\" Ms. Daly said, \"but for now, most economic agents also expect a smooth transition.\" \n\n     Write to Michael S.

Rubin \n\n     FRANKFURT -- Economic growth is slowing in large parts of the globe as businesses struggle to navigate the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pandemic-prompted lockdowns in China and high inflation. \n\n     Surveys of purchasing managers conducted over recent weeks indicate a loss of steam in major economies such as Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. in April. \n\n     While service businesses are benefiting as Covid-19 restrictions are removed and households spend some of the savings they amassed during the pandemic, manufacturing firms in many places are wrestling with higher costs and supply-chain disruptions, according to surveys by S&P Global released Friday. Around the world, businesses worry that the surge in living costs is dampening people's willingness to spend. \n\n     The war in Ukraine suddenly boosted prices and dampened demand in many countries, disrupting a generally strong global economy rebound from the shock of the pandemic. The recovery, bolstered by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, has driven down unemployment in advanced economies while adding to pressure on global supply chains strained by intermittent Covid-19 outbreaks. All that has pushed inflation to the highest levels in several decades on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n     In Germany, Europe's largest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse, the pace of growth in business activity slowed to a three-month low in April. S&P Global said its composite purchasing managers index for Germany slid to 54.5 from 55.1 in March. A reading above 50 indicates growth, while a level below 50 signals contraction. \n\n     The first fall in German manufacturing output since June 2020 was offset by a pickup of service-sector growth to the fastest pace since August. The autos sector was particularly hard hit, recording a steepening and marked loss of output, the surveys found. \n\n     Germany's Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said that its global sales declined by about 6% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier. BMW blamed \"the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the Covid lockdowns in China.\" \n\n     Rolf Breidenbach, chief executive of German auto supplier Hella GmbH Co. KGaA, said in an April 7 earnings statement, \"There are still massive supply shortages for certain electronic components and materials and the development of the coronavirus pandemic also continues to give rise to significant risks, especially in the Chinese market.\" \n\n     \"It can be assumed that the rise in prices, especially for raw and other materials, energy and logistics, will be ongoing,\" he added. \n\n     Germany's Bundesbank warned Friday that an embargo on Russian energy imports would reduce the nation's economic output by about 5% this year, triggering a recession and a further rise in inflation. European officials are currently discussing plans to phase out Russian oil imports. Germany buys more than half its natural-gas imports from Russia. \n\n     U.S. firms reported that business activity rose in April, but at a slower pace than in March, in part because higher inflation curbed the growth in spending on services, the S&P Global survey said. The composite purchasing managers index for the U.S. economy was 55.1, down from 57.7 in March and the lowest in three months. \n\n     \"Many businesses continue to report a tailwind of pent up demand from the pandemic, but companies are also facing mounting challenges from rising inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as persistent supply chain delays and labor constraints,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. \n\n     The PMI for U.S. services providers fell to 54.7 so far in April, from 58 in March and the lowest in three months. Manufacturers reported an upswing in April activity, with the PMI coming in at 59.7, the highest in seven months and up from 58.8 in February. \n\n     In the U.S., services providers raised their prices at the fastest rate on record, according to S&P Global, as firms passed on higher costs to customers. Manufacturers reported they are expanding their workforce numbers at the fastest rate since July 2021 as they try to relieve a backlog of orders. \n\n     The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday reduced its forecast for global economic growth this year by nearly a percentage point to 3.6%, down from 6.1% last year, warning that the war in Ukraine was adding to the economic strains wrought by the pandemic. The institution warned that recent lockdowns in key manufacturing and trade hubs in China would likely compound supply disruptions elsewhere. \n\n     China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 is battering consumer spending and hurting industrial production in an economy grappling with a real estate crunch and a regulatory crackdown on industries including technology and education. \n\n     \"What we see in China is that consumption is falling short; it is not recovering as strongly as necessary,\" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Wednesday. \n\n     In the U.K., the S&P Global surveys pointed to a marked cooling in the pace of economic growth in April. The composite PMI for the U.K. declined to 57.6 from 60.9 in March, reaching a three-month low. Businesses said rising living costs and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine had impacted client demand. Business optimism declined to the lowest since October 2020. \n\n     \"Firms are taking a more cautious approach to hiring and spending as demand cools and the outlook becomes gloomier, to suggest that the slowdown in the economy has further to run,\" Mr. Williamson said. \n\n     U.K. retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in March, according to official data published Friday, while consumer confidence sank to the second-lowest on record in April. \n\n     \"The U.K. is teetering on the edge of a recession and that's before inflation hits 8% or higher later this year,\" said Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International. \n\n     The surveys indicated an acceleration in growth overall in the 19-nation eurozone, whose composite PMI rose to 55.8 in April from 54.9 in March. Business activity among service providers rose at the fastest rate since August, led by a boom in tourism and recreation activity. The pickup could encourage the European Central Bank to move ahead with aggressive interest-rate increases aimed at containing skyrocketing inflation, economists said. ECB officials have signaled that they could start to increase rates as soon as July. \n\n     Such moves add to headwinds that are ricocheting through global financial markets and weighing on asset prices. Borrowing costs are already rising sharply around the world as investors anticipate more rate rises from the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. \n\n     One bright spot in Europe is France, where growth picked up in recent weeks to the strongest level since January 2018, as a modest uptick in factory output was accompanied by the largest surge in services activity since the start of that year, S&P Global said. France's economy is less reliant than Germany's on manufacturing and on Russian energy. \n\n     Despite the record drop in inflation-adjusted wages, \"consumers still seem eager to spend some of their savings built up during the lockdowns now that restrictions have eased,\" said Bert Colijn, an economist with ING Bank. \n\n     Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Gabriel T.

The Biggest Players Got Better. -- WSJ\n\n  By Ben Cohen \n\n \n\n     The best players in the NBA this season were three very large men from three different countries, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and even they might admit the best player in the world as the playoffs begin this weekend is Kevin Durant. \n\n     But there is something odd about the game's biggest stars: Their games are nothing alike. \n\n     They happen to be about the same height, but at no other time in the history of the NBA have 7-footers been so remarkably dissimilar. They don't look like each other. They don't work like each other, either. They certainly don't behave on the court like any of the hulking behemoths who came before them. \n\n     Even the stories of how they got to the league have little in common. Durant was the greatest American player of his era. Embiid was a volleyball player in Cameroon. Jokic was a pudgy kid in Serbia. Antetokounmpo was a scrawny teen in Greece. \n\n     But together these four players standing about 28 feet tall have cast a long shadow over the league. They are still the most dominant forces in a sport where simply being larger than everyone is no longer enough to dominate. \n\n     At a time when the big man risked becoming an endangered species, Jokic, Embiid, Durant and Antetokounmpo are making Darwin proud as living proof of basketball adaptation. \n\n     \"I believe in evolution,\" says NBA legend Bill Walton. \"These really incredible players who have capitalized and used and leveraged every possible advantage that today's athletes have in terms of training and conditioning and nutrition and science and medicine and equipment and court surface and ball quality and the technology. Everything that goes into making today better than yesterday. I believe in all this stuff.\" \n\n     It would be difficult to watch the NBA and believe otherwise. \n\n     The first thing anyone sees when they look at these players is their size, but the most striking part about today's big men is their collection of skills. The mobility, nimbleness and versatility they flaunt on a nightly basis is nothing less than mind-boggling to the few people on the planet who see eye-to-eye with them. \n\n     \"I come from an era where that was unheard of,\" said Alaa Abdelnaby, an NBA player in the 1990s who now has a front-row seat to Embiid's theatrics as a Philadelphia 76ers broadcaster. \"That package was beyond anyone's comprehension when I was in the league.\" \n\n     Even basketball stats these days are subject to inflation, but their numbers this season were staggering. Jokic registered the highest player-efficiency rating of all time, surpassing the mark previously set by Antetokounmpo, who also broke his own record. Embiid, meanwhile, became the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 to win the scoring title. \n\n     Which one of these international stars deserves the MVP award is the battleground of NBA podcasts, but far more interesting than the marginal discrepancies in their statistical cases are the massive differences in the way they do their jobs. \n\n     Their ancestors might lament big men today, but the game has never demanded more from their breed. They have to cover more ground. They have to guard more positions. Like so many jobs in the modern economy, they have to do more of just about everything. \n\n     \"There's nobody in my group who's going to like this style of basketball, \" says Bill Cartwright, the 7-foot-1 center who won three championships with Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. \"But it is what it is right now. And it's going to keep evolving into something else later.\" \n\n     Embiid is the closest approximation to a traditional big man, but there is nothing traditional about anyone his size who is graceful handling the ball, comfortable behind the 3-point arc and productive at the free-throw line. The only 7-footers ever to average more foul shots than Embiid this season were Wilt Chamberlain and O'Neal, but Chamberlain's career-high at the line was 61% and O'Neal made 51% in the year he took the most foul shots. Embiid is an 81% shooter. \n\n     There's someone else a few thousand miles away doing things nobody has seen before. Jokic led the Nuggets in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks while functioning as Denver's center, point guard and basically every position in between. The whole team would fall apart without him. In fact, it does. The Nuggets won Jokic's minutes by 8.4 points per 100 possessions and managed to lose the minutes he was on the bench by 7.9 points. That gap in net rating was easily the widest margin in the league. \n\n     Jokic and Embiid will likely finish atop MVP ballots for the second year in a row, and most NBA general managers would still prefer to have Antetokounmpo attacking the hoop or Durant doing anything he wants in the playoffs, but they can't go wrong with any of them. What makes them so dangerous is they don't just score over people. They also create ways to score around them. They can beat you vertically and horizontally. \n\n     \"They're basketball players who happen to be big,\" Walton says, \"as opposed to big guys who are trying to play basketball.\" \n\n     How to stop these seemingly unstoppable talents is a question that will help determine the playoffs this spring and contract negotiations this summer. Some big men will have to play smaller to stay on the court. Other teams will ask smaller guys to play bigger. Their performance will be one of the driving factors behind deal talks and the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in salary as soon as the season is over. \n\n     But the great irony of big men reasserting their supremacy is that the 3-point line was designed to blunt their genetic advantages. \n\n     The NBA was looking for ways to electrify the game and diversify its talent pool when it dropped a strip of paint on the court that would change basketball forever. Before the existence of this arc, it didn't make sense for them to drift from the paint, the most efficient part of the court. Now they had a powerful mathematical incentive. In every season between 1965 and 1980, the MVP of the league was a center. But in the four decades since the line was introduced, especially the last one, the game shifted away from the basket and out of their control. \n\n     This could have been an event of mass extinction for the giants roaming the basketball earth unless they adapted in order to survive. The players who were already in the NBA when the 3-point line joined them wouldn't get that opportunity. Even the ones in college and high school would struggle to adjust to a game that fundamentally changed overnight. It would take a generation or two for big men to have the freedom to be anyone they wanted. \n\n     \"For guys of my era, I always think: What would it have been like if you grew up and were told you could do everything?\" says former NBA center Chris Dudley. \n\n     One of the bizarre things about the way basketball talent is recognized, developed and rewarded is that despite all the money, resources and data poured into valuations, even the brightest minds can get the best players wrong. It's a humbling business that requires making predictions based on projecting how teenagers might behave a decade later. The market that exists to identify future talent is deeply inefficient almost by definition. \n\n     But it's especially tricky to figure out how any big man might fit into today's NBA because their job requirements keep shifting. \n\n     They are no longer confined by their position. They're redefining it. \n\n     \"These guys don't live under those restrictions or limitations,\" Walton said. \"One of the endlessly beautiful things about basketball is that it's an extension of the creativity and imagination that comes from a fertile mind. We are witnessing that right now in the way these guys play.\" \n\n     Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 15, 2022 08:00 ET (12:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.269986Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:34:16.928024Z", "inner_id": 439, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5808, "annotations": [{"id": 6291, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "6yNvM4lo9B", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:35:12.630728Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:35:12.630753Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 54.953, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "aa994267-4862-455c-98e1-950d1e871b41", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5808, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Battle for Materials Slows Drillers -- WSJ\n\n  A scarcity of equipment, raw materials, workers and investment capital is raising costs and causing delays for some producers in the Permian Basin \n\nBy Collin Eaton \n\n     MIDLAND, Texas -- America's most prolific oil field is running out of the workers, cash and equipment needed to produce more oil. \n\n     In the Permian Basin, the sprawling oil-rich region in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, drillers are facing long delays and steep competition for everything from roughnecks to steel to fracking pumps. \n\n     The region is the only place where U.S. crude production is expected to grow significantly this year, and the Biden administration is hoping production there can help alleviate high prices at the pump. But mounting supply-chain crunches are putting a ceiling on how much more frackers can produce there, said energy executives and analysts, despite the highest oil prices in roughly seven years. \n\n     Unlike the last time oil fetched about $100 a barrel, the vast service industry of steel suppliers, drilling-rig operators and fracking companies that develop shale producers' wells is coming into the current price cycle malnourished. Service companies mothballed large fleets of equipment during the pandemic and investors remain wary of the industry, leaving companies short of capital and reluctant to invest in new fracking fleets and drilling rigs. \n\n     U.S. drillers are expected to raise domestic oil output by about 8% from last year to about 12.6 million barrels a day by December, according to the Energy Information Administration, and analysts say most of that growth will come from the Permian. By contrast, in 2014, the last time oil prices topped $100 a barrel, U.S. production grew by 1.6 million barrels a day, nearly 20% over the year, according to the EIA. \n\n     Several factors are holding back production, including publicly listed producers' decision to return more cash to investors and limit spending on growth as well as the rapid depletion of some of the best shale wells. Now, supply-chain snarls mean that shale companies that want to grow production will be hard-pressed to do so. \n\n     The bottlenecks have forced some shale producers to pause operations for days, weeks or even months while they wait for steel casing, for which there is currently far less inventory than usual in the Permian, or to replace workers, many of whom haven't returned to the industry since the pandemic. In some cases, entire crews have left projects before completion in search of bigger paychecks, executives said. \n\n     \"If somebody walked in and put a pile of money on the table and said, 'Drill me a well next week,' it isn't going to happen,\" said Jamie Small, president of private-equity-backed oil producer Element Petroleum III. \"You just can't get the stuff to do it.\" \n\n     It took Element a month to replace a crew that walked away from a job fracking several of the company's wells, in favor of a higher-paying gig, Mr. Small said. Most of the fracking companies Element tried to hire asked it to source its own sand, a key ingredient used to prop open fissures in fossil fuel-bearing rocks, which was too expensive to do. It eventually hired two smaller entrants to begin work next month, he said. \n\n     Mr. Small said his company is looking to drill 10 to 12 wells this year, but even with high oil prices, it would be difficult to find the resources to increase that to 15 or 18 wells. \n\n     Steve Burleson, president of Burleson Petroleum, said he may have to wait at least nine months for an underground electric cable for parts of his oil-field operations, after a plant that makes the equipment shut down. Meanwhile, he said his other option is to incur an additional $35,000 per month energy bill to run a generator that will have to consume 500 gallons of diesel a day. \n\n     Mr. Burleson said he is concerned the supply-chain problems will raise costs beyond his estimated $11 million budget for a new well he is planning to drill next month. It is already 35% more expensive than the last well his company drilled in December, he said. \n\n     In the past three years, capital spending by the oil-field services sector has fallen roughly 70% compared with the three-year period 2017-2019, said Ann Fox, chief executive officer of Nine Energy Service. Deep budget cuts during the pandemic meant companies predominantly spent money on maintaining existing equipment rather than building new tools, she said. That left the Permian short on fracking equipment and drilling rigs. \n\n     Executives said daily rates for drilling rigs have run as high as $30,000, almost double the cost of last year's prices. Walking through a Permian rig yard last week, Kurt Bailey, operations manager at rig company Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., said his company has virtually all of its locally available 56 top-end drilling rigs deployed in different parts of the Permian, and has just a handful of older models sitting idle. \n\n     Likewise, the price of steel pipe used in drilling and bringing oil wells online has climbed substantially in the past few months. Steel distributors in the Permian have little inventory, typically sending their steel pipe to oil companies soon after it reaches their yards, executives said. \n\n     Diamondback Energy Inc., one of the largest Permian oil producers, has seen costs for steel casing shoot up, with U.S. steel prices up nearly 40% since the end of 2020. Diamondback plans to keep oil production roughly flat this year, but if it tried to increase production, it would have to steer equipment away from smaller rivals by paying higher prices, Chief Operating Officer Daniel Wesson said. \n\n     The dynamic creates a zero-sum game in the Permian, where one producer's decision to grow comes at the expense of a competitor and would be unlikely to lift the Permian's net output, Mr. Wesson said. \n\n     \"If we were going to change to growth mode right now, anything we'd do would be inflationary,\" he said. \n\n     American shale companies have deployed some 250 fracking fleets into the nation's oil patches, with only about 15 to 25 more available on the sidelines, said Robert Drummond, CEO of NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc., a large fracking company. \n\n     Mr. Drummond said his company believes that until companies build more fracking equipment, U.S. oil-production growth will top out at less than 1 million barrels a day annually. \n\n     The shortfalls could persist into 2023 if oil-field service companies continue to keep capital investments low and relegate spending to maintaining, rather than building, equipment, according to executives in the industry, including at Halliburton Co., the largest U.S. service company. \n\n     \"When you look at the capital that's available to oil-field services, it's not enough to make a meaningful difference,\" in the oil-field-supply chain, said Casey Maxwell, vice president of the Permian Basin for Halliburton. \n\n     Write to Collin Eaton at collin.eaton@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (April 29, 2022). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 29, 2022 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270021Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:35:12.871319Z", "inner_id": 440, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5809, "annotations": [{"id": 6292, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "3GG04KJDJM", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:35:36.038106Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T18:27:09.797781Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 426.97900000000004, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "4fa875b3-8b9f-4a72-ab27-da21fdfd7a1f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5809, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Companies May Speed Up Refinancing Plans as Higher Rates Loom -- WSJ\n\nBy Nina Trentmann \n\n     Companies looking to tap the debt markets will likely accelerate those plans after Federal Reserve minutes revealed that half-percentage point rises in interest rates might be in the offing to curb inflation. \n\n     Interest rates remain low, even after the Fed's quarter-point rate rise last month. But the hawkish outlook at the U.S. central bank may be sharpening financing plans at major corporations. \n\n     \"A lot of the supply in the second quarter will be companies that say, with the Fed signaling higher rates, it's better to get capital now,\" said James Shepard, head of the investment-grade-debt capital-markets business at Mizuho Americas. \n\n     Released Wednesday, minutes of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee showed members considered raising rates by 50 basis points at their March 15-16 meeting. \n\n     \"Many participants noted that one or more [half-percentage-point] increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified,\" the minutes said. \n\n     Instead, U.S. central bank officials agreed to a more modest rise in the benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. They also penciled in a series of increases for later this year, moving rates closer to 2%. \n\n     In the current quarter, $242.65 billion in U.S. corporate debt will be coming due, followed by $199.64 billion in the next and $197.26 billion in the fourth, according to data provider Dealogic. \n\n     Some businesses could opt to just pay down their debt, but many are expected to refinance, corporate bankers said. \n\n     According to Dealogic, AT&T Inc., AbbVie Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Phillips 66 are among businesses with more than $1 billion in debt maturing in the second quarter -- in AT&T's case, more than $20 billion. \n\n     All four companies declined to comment. But bankers think the current market's appeal will be fading over time. \n\n     \"There is still that mentality of taking advantage of healthy market conditions and locking in rates with the concern that we might see rates continue to rise from here,\" said Dan Mead, head of the investment grade syndicate at Bank of America Corp. \n\n     \"Even with the increase in interest rates, financing costs are still attractive,\" noted Marc Fratepietro, global co-head of the investment-grade debt capital markets business at Deutsche Bank AG. \n\n     After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, finance executives suddenly found themselves plying choppier markets. But the turmoil seemed to have little effect on bond sales. According to data provider Refinitiv, companies sold $458.06 billion in U.S. investment grade-rated corporate bonds in the first quarter, roughly in line with the prior-year period. \n\n     Some companies are locking in interest rates as they prepare to hedge coming maturities. \n\n     Johnson Controls International PLC, a building products and energy services company, has just under $1 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months. The company is hedging rates for most of the debt it plans to refinance, Finance Chief Olivier Leonetti said. \n\n     Many businesses in recent months took advantage of still-low rates to bring down their financing costs. Boston Scientific Corp., a maker of medical devices, in March priced $3 billion in senior notes in Europe and tendered a similar amount, $2.85 billion, in the U.S. \n\n     The transaction was meant to diversify the company's debt portfolio, adding more debt in Europe to better balance its exposure to the U.S., CFO Dan Brennan said. \"We were able to bring down our overall debt cost by 80 basis points,\" he said. \n\n     Businesses planning to issue debt over the coming weeks will have to be flexible on timing, bankers said. \n\n     \"It's a combination of thoughtful consideration and luck,\" said Aaron Alt, chief financial officer at Sysco Corp., referring to finding the right moment to go to market. The Houston-based food-service company refinanced $1.25 billion in debt late last year and plans to pay down about $450 million in debt this year. \n\n     \"We are constantly assessing opportunities that the banks are bringing to us,\" Mr. Alt added, speaking of the company's liability management. \n\n     The FOMC next meets in early May. \n\n     Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 07, 2022 09:04 ET (13:04 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270052Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T18:27:10.241692Z", "inner_id": 441, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5810, "annotations": [{"id": 6293, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "ccUUU7pXW-", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T20:50:52.646427Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T20:50:52.646453Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 915.581, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "f1f6db22-2515-48cd-b8eb-0ceefab87207", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5810, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Dow Falls for Fourth Straight Day -- WSJ\n\n  By Justin Baer,Will Horner and Dave Sebastian \n\n \n\n     U.S. stocks swung between gains and losses on Tuesday as uncertainty over inflation, interest rates and the economy continued to weigh on the market. \n\n     All three major indexes opened higher, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite up 2.8% at one point. By late morning, stocks had mostly erased those gains and appeared on track to extend a brutal three-day slide. But as the afternoon wore on, investors turned their attention to Wednesday's report on consumer prices and the possibility that inflation may be peaking -- and stocks rebounded again. \n\n     The S&P 500 closed up 9.81 points, 0.2%, at 4001.05, a day after the broad index slumped 3.2% to its lowest level for the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 114.42 points, or 1%, to 11737.67. \n\n     \"The market was taking too negative of a read on the consumer-price index, leading to the afternoon recovery,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \n\n     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight trading session, hitting a 52-week low. It closed down 84.96 points, or 0.3%, at 32160.74. \n\n     A cocktail of geopolitical risks and economic headwinds is posing the biggest threat to global growth in years and rattling markets. In the U.S., soaring inflation has prompted the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates and investors fear the move could tip the economy into recession. \n\n     Global markets are looking equally troubled. In China, resurgent Covid-19 outbreaks and Beijing's strict approach to fighting them threaten to revive the supply chain bottlenecks that first drove inflation higher. In Europe, the war in Ukraine threatens to keep energy prices elevated and is weighing on the region's growth. \n\n     \"People came in this morning expecting a relief rally after being hammered the last few days,\" said Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. \"But with inflation in the U.S., the Covid challenges in China and the war in Ukraine, rarely have we seen three major market-moving catalysts converge.\" \n\n     Early Tuesday, some investors snapped up shares that had been battered by those headwinds. \n\n     \"Everyone at this point is looking to see if we've bottomed,\" said Quincy Krosby, Chief Equity Strategist for LPL Financial. \"The instincts are that we haven't bottomed yet.\" \n\n     Wednesday's report on fresh consumer-price index data is expected to show inflation rose at a slower pace in April than the previous month, Ms. Krosby said. \n\n     Investor sentiment can turn on a dime, she added. In January 2019, a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank would be patient with rate increases -- reversing a steep market selloff. \n\n     The market has entered a new era, Mr. Quinlan said, and investors are more inclined to wait for solid evidence that those challenges have subsided before betting the stocks have reached a bottom. \n\n     \"Investors are very skeptical now,\" he said. \"They want to see the data. They don't want to listen to policy makers. Any improvements build the scaffolding for the bottom. But we're not there yet.\" \n\n     Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Tuesday that he believes the Fed can achieve a \"softish landing\" for the U.S. economy while raising rates, though the unemployment rate could rise. \n\n     \"By 2023 you are very likely to see growth slowing very significantly, and the specter of recessions is really starting to loom,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"What we are seeing is the realization that it is going to be very tough for the Fed to get that soft landing just right.\" \n\n     Investors on Tuesday were welcoming signs that the conflict in Ukraine wasn't escalating and a planned EU embargo on Russian oil could face delays, Ms. Shah said. \n\n     Peloton Interactive fell $1.23, or 8.7%, to $12.90 after reporting declining sales and mounting losses as the stationary-bike maker struggles with the return to prepandemic consumer habits. \n\n     Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. surged by $56.86, or 68%, to $140 after Pfizer said it would buy the rest of the company for around $11.6 billion. \n\n     Duke Realty rose $1.87, or 3.9%, to $49.58 after Prologis said it had made an offer to buy the real-estate investment trust for about $23.7 billion. Prologis fell $6.96, or 5.3%, to $125.41. \n\n     The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.990% from 3.080% on Monday. \n\n     Brent crude oil fell $3.48, or 3.3%, to $102.46 a barrel. Oil prices had been rising for the past few months, but concerns that China's lockdowns will sap demand for commodities have taken some steam off the rally. \n\n     Demand for oil in China is likely to rebound sharply when restrictions start to ease, though the European Union's proposed ban on imports of Russian oil remains an overhang, said Daniel Hynes, a senior commodity strategist at ANZ in Sydney. \n\n     \"The fundamentals are still very tilted toward an extremely tight market with certainly risks skewed to further declines in supply over the next three to six months,\" Mr. Hynes said. \n\n     Bitcoin prices edged lower after a steep selloff. The world's largest cryptocurrency on Tuesday traded at $30,959.99 as of 5 p.m. ET, down 0.4% from $31,075.70 at the same time a day earlier. \n\n     Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%.

The strategists expect the \"hawks\" to become worried about recession closing the window for raising rates. \n\n  U.S. Markets: \n\n  Stock futures traded modestly lower on Powell's hawkish pivot. \n\n  Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that while Powell's sentiment was not \"necessarily new, his explicit comment that neutral rates are 'not a stopping point' garnered focus\" on Wall Street. \n\n  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.964% from 2.969% Tuesday. \n\n  Shares on the move premarket: \n\n  Lowe's was up slightly ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report. Home-improvement rival Home Depot finished with a gain of 1.7% Tuesday after earnings topped analysts' expectations and it raised guidance for 2022. \n\n  --- \n\n  Target gained 0.4%. It reports earnings Wednesday. Shares of the retailer fell 1.4% Tuesday after Walmart missed first-quarter earnings expectations and forecast a decline in full-year per-share earnings. \n\n  Forex: \n\n  The scope for the euro to rise against the dollar looks limited as the market's expectations for interest-rate rises from the ECB seem too aggressive, said ING. \n\n  Markets are pricing in too much tightening for the ECB but not for the Fed, while the U.S.-eurozone growth divergence will become more relevant into the summer, exacerbated by the EU-Russia standoff on commodities, said ING. \n\n  \"With this in mind, we suspect that any further rally in EUR/USD may start to lose steam around the 1.0650-1.0700 area, with risks of a return below 1.0500 in the near term being quite material.\" \n\n  --- \n\n  Sterling fell after data showed U.K. inflation accelerated further in April, hitting 9%, and adding pressure on already strained household incomes. Economists polled by the WSJ expected inflation to reach 9.1%. \n\n  \"Inflation in the U.K. is completely out of control, and there is no doubt that soaring inflation is having a negative influence on disposable incomes,\" said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam. \n\n  The Bank of England is under pressure to do more to control inflation but it is walking a fine line and can only do so much, he said. \n\n  Bonds: \n\n  Eurozone government bonds steadied in early European trading following a selloff Tuesday triggered by a risk-on mood in global markets. \n\n  --- \n\n  Citi estimates the fair value of France's new 0.75% February 2028 government bond 8 basis points above the yield of the 0% February 2027 OAT. \n\n  The French Treasury Agency will launch the new bond as part of a EUR10 billion-EUR11.5 billion auction Thursday where it will also reopen the 0% February 2025 OAT and the 0% February 2026 OAT. Citi said they see relative value in the February 2025 and February 2026 OAT on the French bond curve. \n\n  --- \n\n  The green premium on Denmark's 0% November 2031 green bond, which will be reopened at auction on Wednesday, has narrowed to 1 basis point versus its conventional twin bond from around 5 bps at the launching auction in January, said Danske Bank. However, the green premium rarely goes below 1 bp and thus the 10-year Danish green bond looks cheap relative to EU peers such as Germany and the Netherlands. \n\n  The green premium, or \"greenium\", on the Danish green government bond is exactly measurable because the Danish debt management office issues green bonds in a twin-bond structure, first applied by Germany, with conventional and green bonds having identical maturity and coupons. \n\n  Energy: \n\n  Oil futures were more than 1% higher on easing Covid curbs in China and expectations for new sanctions on Russia, with DNB Markets forecasting prices will rise as high as $130 by the end of the year before easing to $115 next year. \n\n  A combination of increased demand as China eases its Covid-19 lockdowns and declining Russian oil production is likely to completely exhaust global capacity by the end of the year, said DNB Markets. \n\n  Macquarie said that while the near-term outlook for oil is strong, it expects prices to fade in the second half. \n\n  Brent crude has averaged $107 in the second quarter so far but a likely increase in supply from OPEC and other countries, potentially including Iran, should weigh on prices in the second half, Macquarie said. \n\n  \"We maintain our long-term assumption of $65 but defer this to the first quarter of 2024 [from 1Q of 2023],\" Macquarie said. \n\n  Metals: \n\n  Industrial metals weakened on gloomy signs for the global economy following Powell's comments Tuesday.

This will depend on the speed and direction of the energy transition, the volume of mining capital investment, environmental constraints on these industries, and policy measures and incentives,\" the bank said. \n\n  Both copper and aluminum were highlighted as key beneficiaries of the energy transition, with the red metal used in wind turbines, solar panels, grid connections, electric vehicles, and battery charging infrastructure, according to the bank. Meanwhile, aluminum is used in battery packaging, hydrogen fuel cells, and solar photovoltaics. \n\n  Other key metals will be steel alloys like chromium and iron ore, battery metals like nickel, lithium and cobalt as well as rare earth and platinum group metals. \n\n  One of the key risks the bank noted was that mineral availability can often be centralized to certain key regions within the world, something that isn't seen as much in other commodity sectors. \n\n  \"Global metal production and consumption are considerably more concentrated geographically than oil production. China, in particular, is the single largest consumer and producer of all refined base metals. It accounts for roughly 50 percent of global consumption of metals, while it consumes just 15 percent of global crude oil output.\" \n\n  Meanwhile more than 70% of cobalt production, key for electric-vehicle batteries, is limited to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while more than 90% of chemical processing takes place in China, according to industry body the Cobalt Institute. \n\n  This could result in supply risks and price volatility, while also bringing windfall revenues for countries that host the minerals and their processing, the report said. \n\n  The bank also called for policy makers to \"provide a conducive policy environment that ensures sufficient investment goes into metals production to avoid future shortfalls.\" This would involve ensuring projects can be expanded quickly if a resource is found while implementing subsidies, raising recycling rates and using carbon pricing. \n\n  The World Bank added that an organization similar to the International Energy Agency should be established, with a focus on metals and minerals to assist with data collection and analysis. \n\n \n\n  Write to Yusuf Khan at yusuf.khan@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 12, 2022 09:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270155Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:18:49.771465Z", "inner_id": 444, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5813, "annotations": [{"id": 6296, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "ZcGKakmFPz", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:19:22.549295Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:19:22.549321Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 31.995, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d75a4990-cc29-43fa-a547-8935271f8dd1", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5813, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Apple Boosting Pay Budget for Workers Amid Tight Labor Market -- Update\n\n  By Tim Higgins \n\n \n\n     Apple Inc. is boosting pay for workers amid rising inflation, a tight labor market and unionization pushes among hourly store employees. \n\n     The iPhone maker on Wednesday told employees in an email that the company is increasing its overall compensation budget. Starting pay for hourly workers in the U.S. will rise to $22 an hour, or higher based upon the market, a 45% increase from 2018. Starting salaries in the U.S. are also expected to increase. \n\n     \"Supporting and retaining the best team members in the world enables us to deliver the best, most innovative, products and services for our customers,\" an Apple spokesman said in a statement. \"This year as part of our annual performance review process, we're increasing our overall compensation budget.\" \n\n     Apple's plans are just the latest by companies fighting to keep talent. Microsoft Corp. told workers this month that the company would almost double its global budget for merit-based salary raises. \n\n     In recent months, Apple has been facing unusual labor unrest. That discontent has spanned from front-line store retail workers agitating for unionization to salaried engineers unhappy with the company's plans to return to the office. \n\n     Some workers, including those hourly employees in its stores and AppleCare, were told their annual reviews would be moved up three months and that their pay increases would take effect in early July, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The normal review process coincides with the end of Apple's fiscal year in the fall. \n\n     Those workers were told the company's increased compensation budget would be in addition to pay increases and special awards already received within the past year. \n\n     Facing a war for talent, tech companies have also seen their biggest compensation tools -- stock awards -- hindered by a downturn in company valuations.

With a lower number of Covid-19 cases and the further easing of domestic restrictions, consumer spending is likely to rebound further in 2Q, and another tailwind will come from the reopening to international travel, he says. While the tourism recovery is still in its infancy, the reopening of borders has allowed companies to fill labor shortages and for day workers to resume crossing to Singapore to work in higher-paid jobs, he adds. The economist raises his 2022 GDP growth forecast to 8.5% from 6.5%.

The average growth-focused mutual fund is down by more than 30% in 2022 as of June 13, according to fund tracker Morningstar. \n\n     Yet growth stocks could well be worth buying now. The growth-stock universe is priced at about a 20% discount to estimates of fair value by Morningstar analysts. But that doesn't mean stocks can't get cheaper. In today's volatile markets, investors should remain wary of super-aggressive funds like ARK Innovation (ticker: ARKK), which was up 152% in 2020 and is down more than 50% in 2022. \n\n     For investors who can't stomach gut-wrenching volatility, a more cautious approach toward growth is warranted. One way to find lower-risk growth funds is to look at their volatility stats. \n\n     A fund like MFS Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock (MIGFX) could fit the bill. It has a standard deviation -- a volatility measure -- of 17.8%, while the average fund in Morningstar's Large Growth category sits at 20.9%. The MFS fund's beta -- a measure of market sensitivity -- is 0.96, indicating if the market rises or falls 10%, it rises and falls 9.6%. The average large-growth fund rises and falls 5% more than the market with a beta of 1.05. By comparison, ARK Innovation has a 1.73 beta and a 43% standard deviation -- way more volatile. The MFS fund is down 21.8% in 2022, besting 90% of its peers, which average minus 30%. \n\n     Yet volatility stats are all in the rearview mirror. It's important to understand why a fund has been less volatile, and whether its risk profile is sustainable. That requires digging into the manager's strategy. \"We focus on owning high-quality, durable [earnings] growth compounders that we believe will have relatively resilient fundamentals even through challenging times,\" Jeff Constantino, Massachusetts Investors Growth's co-manager, tells Barron's. \"This leads us to favor companies with strong sustainable competitive advantages, or wide economic moats, typically with high profit margins, [product] pricing power, strong balance sheets, and significant cash-flow generation.\" \n\n     Quality, admittedly an ambiguous term, is a recurrent theme for many defensive growth-stock funds. Typically, a high-quality company has a dominant market position in its industry and high barriers to entry for competitors -- as Warren Buffett calls it, an \"economic moat.\" Such dominance gives it price control over its products, a valuable advantage in today's inflationary environment. \n\n     \"Our companies, for the most part, should be able to increase pricing to offset [their increased] costs,\" says Brett Reiner, co-manager of Neuberger Berman Genesis (NBGNX). He points to one of his largest holdings -- Pool Corp. (POOL), a pool equipment supplier: \"They're the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies in the U.S., with a 35 to 40% market share, multiples higher than the next biggest player in the industry.\" Despite a dramatic 34.5% decline in Pool's stock price in 2022, Reiner thinks the company's dominance can enable it to pass on higher costs to its customers via price hikes. \n\n     The Neuberger fund is interesting, as it is one of the few low-risk small-cap growth funds. It's easier to find dominant blue-chip growth companies with wide moats, such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). There aren't many search engines that can compete with Google. \n\n     Reiner searches for small companies in a niche business they can dominate. Yet he still has a healthy 26.8% weighting in technology, a sector ruled by behemoths. \"We stay away from businesses that have to compete directly with those 800-pound gorillas,\" he says. Instead, he invests in companies like Manhattan Associates (MANH), which provides reasonably priced but difficult to replace \"mission critical\" supply-chain software to businesses. \n\n     There are low-cost index exchange-traded funds that focus on wide-moat companies, but many lack another important ingredient to risk control -- a focus on valuation. Most defensive actively managed mutual funds employ a growth-at-a-reasonable price, or GARP, strategy -- not a growth-at-any-price one. This is especially important now, as rising bond interest rates hurt expensive stocks the most. That's because bonds pay their yields up front, while expensive stocks promise profits in the distant future. The higher the average bond's yield, the less willing stock investors are to wait on a pricey stock's promised growth. \n\n     For this reason, in the ETF space it might make more sense to buy a blended fund that incorporates growth and value factors in its selection process -- such as VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT) or Franklin LibertyQ US Equity (FLQL) -- than a pure growth one like Vanguard Mega Cap Growth (MGK). The VanEck and Franklin ETFs are each down about 17% to 18% this year, versus Vanguard Mega Cap Growth's minus 32%. \n\n     In the mutual fund space, Massachusetts Investors Growth, Neuberger Berman Genesis, Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), Calvert Equity (CSIEX), and Janus Henderson Enterprise (JAENX) all employ valuation disciplines to keep risk in line. \n\n     Morningstar's director of manager research, Russ Kinnel, is particularly fond of Jensen Quality Growth. While it can still get hurt in market downturns or recessions, its strict quality and valuation discipline protect it, he says: \"If I'm wrong, and the recession has another leg down, or the market is down, I'm still going to make [my investment] back because there's some good defense characteristics here.\" \n\n     There are other ways to control risk. In addition to seeking high-quality companies, Capital Advisors Growth (CIAOX) typically holds some cash -- 11% of its portfolio as of March 31 -- for defensive reasons. It's down 19.9% in 2022. Pacer Trendpilot 100 (PTNQ) can go to 100% cash if market conditions are rough. \n\n     Of course, holding cash at a market bottom could cause you to lose significant upside in a recovery. If you're going to play growth stocks today, you have to be willing to accept the potential for some pain, albeit hopefully not too much. \n\n     Email: editors@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  To subscribe to Barron's, visit http://www.barrons.com/subscribe \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 17, 2022 21:30 ET (01:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270281Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-06T11:14:24.503584Z", "inner_id": 448, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5817, "annotations": [{"id": 6300, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "HDcyqIK92n", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:21:42.719131Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T18:31:05.819538Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 187.914, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "278fd5b9-8043-491e-9ac8-362f65a3a544", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5817, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Japan Central Bank Chief Apologizes Over Inflation Comment -- WSJ\n\n  By Megumi Fujikawa \n\n \n\n     TOKYO -- The Japanese central bank's governor apologized Wednesday for a comment suggesting he liked the way consumers were going along with higher prices, highlighting the political sensitivities of the yen's fall to a 20-year low. \n\n     The yen touched 134 yen to the dollar Wednesday, the lowest level since February 2002. The yen's value in dollar terms has fallen 16% since the beginning of the year, accelerating inflationary pressures because it takes more yen to buy imported goods denominated in dollars. Energy is a particular concern because Japan imports almost all of its oil and gas and needs dollars to pay for it. \n\n     In a speech Monday, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda pointed to data suggesting Japanese consumers have developed more tolerance for price rises. He seemed to welcome the trend as a sign the nation was getting away from a decadeslong deflationary mind-set that the central bank has blamed for keeping the economy in the doldrums. \n\n     But with parliamentary elections coming up in July, opposition parties seized on the comments to accuse Mr. Kuroda of cheering on high inflation. A Twitter hashtag that translates as \"we do not accept higher prices\" was trending. \n\n     Summoned to a parliamentary committee, Mr. Kuroda issued an apology. \n\n     \"The expression that households are tolerating price increases was completely inappropriate, and I take it back,\" Mr. Kuroda said. He said he recognized that paying more at the store was a painful choice for consumers and not something they welcomed. \n\n     Japan's consumer prices are rising at the fastest pace in three decades, although the inflation rate of 2.5% in April was well below 8.3% in the U.S. \n\n     The development is awkward for the Bank of Japan because it has long sought to achieve inflation of around 2%, but not in the way it is happening now. In the central bank's preferred scenario, modest price rises would come in tandem with wage increases and help generate a virtuous cycle of corporate investment and economic growth. Japan's ultralow interest rates would provide greater stimulus if wages and prices were rising steadily. \n\n     The only part of the scenario coming to fruition, at least for now, is the rise in prices. \n\n     Mr. Kuroda tried to make the best of the situation in his Monday remarks, saying more-entrenched inflation could \"lead to a full-fledged rise in wages\" next year. \n\n     He referred in the speech to a recent survey by Tsutomu Watanabe, a University of Tokyo professor and former Bank of Japan official, that asked consumers in several countries how they would react if the price of a product they always buy in the supermarket went up by 10%. \n\n     The survey found 56% of Japanese consumers would stick to their buying habits, compared with 43% in August 2021 -- a shift Mr. Kuroda called an improvement. The latest figure in the U.S. was 64%. \n\n     Social-media commentators said they didn't see anything improving. A Twitter user said people had no choice when buying daily essentials. \"Everyone is in trouble. We do not accept it. Don't be foolish,\" she wrote. \n\n     Fast Retailing Co., which operates Uniqlo clothing stores, said this week it planned to raise prices in Japan on some items in its autumn and winter collection, such as a fleece jacket that will cost Yen2,990, equivalent to $22, up from Yen1,990 previously. It named the weak yen as one reason. \n\n     Opposition parties are seizing on such cases to attack Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose ruling party is expected to cruise to victory in elections for Parliament's less-powerful upper chamber in July. Polls show Mr. Kishida enjoys widespread support, but inflation is one of his few weak points. \n\n     The opposition Constitutional Democratic Party has named inflation as its top campaign issue. It accused the Bank of Japan of ignoring the yen's fall and suggested it would look at raising interest rates to prop up the yen. \n\n     Mr. Kuroda has repeatedly rejected that idea, saying the economy still needs the stimulus provided by low interest rates. By contrast, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates quickly to fight inflation, helping push up the dollar. \n\n     Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 08, 2022 09:30 ET (13:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270312Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-07T18:31:06.305082Z", "inner_id": 449, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5818, "annotations": [{"id": 6301, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "SM16jV2vbr", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:22:23.298457Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:22:23.298475Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 39.603, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d2035b93-49fd-4173-9070-a88dd7b1502f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5818, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Growth Fears Challenge Soaring Oil Prices -- WSJ\n\n  By Matt Grossman \n\n \n\n     War, the pandemic and world-wide supply problems held oil prices near their highest levels in almost a decade this past quarter. Slowing growth may be the biggest threat to the rally. \n\n     Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, finished June not far from where it came into April, rising 7.7% to $116.26 since the start of the quarter through Wednesday. That was little consolation to drivers at the gas station or truckers and airlines buying diesel and jet fuel as they adjusted to record prices during the first lasting stretch of over-$100-a-barrel crude in almost 10 years. Not since 2013 has a quarter brought a higher average daily closing price for Brent-crude contracts, according to Dow Jones data. \n\n     Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, anxiety about global oil supplies ha s collided with growing demand as the world emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. That tension accelerated in early June after China eased its latest round of lockdowns, boosting demand and helping send Brent futures briefly spiking above $120 a barrel. \n\n     Meanwhile, oil producers have responded with only limited new investments in pumping more oil, chastened by environmentalist scrutiny of fossil fuels and by their record of overinvestment during previous price surges. That has kept supply forecasts tight. \n\n     \"The big picture is that global demand for oil is back to, if not exceeding, pre-Covid levels, but global supply is not,\" said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Kansas-based investment firm TortoiseEcofin. \"We're continuing to have this persistently undersupplied oil market.\" \n\n     Pricier crude hits U.S. consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices, which reached an average of $5 a gallon nationally for the first time this month. By raising costs for companies, higher fuel prices also contribute to faster inflation in a broad set of goods and services. \n\n     Meanwhile, prices for diesel, the fuel of choice for many commercial vehicles, are up about 78% from last year at $5.780 a gallon, according to AAA, further raising companies' fuel costs. Jet fuel prices have also rocketed higher. \n\n     That has made crude oil a key driver of the soaring inflation that has rattled financial markets this spring. Central banks' mounting response, which this month brought the biggest Federal Reserve interest-rate increase since 1994, have fueled fears of a potential recession. \n\n     Those concerns, investors say, are one of the few factors working to keep a lid on oil prices. As growth fears have mounted, crude prices through Wednesday were on track in June to record their first down month since November 2021. \n\n     \"There is a growth slowdown happening, and if you enter into that situation, there's going to be a demand drop for oil,\" said Maneesh Deshpande, a Barclays analyst. \"That's part of the reason why oil has sold off a bit.\" \n\n     Mr. Deshpande's analysis notes that energy-company stocks -- still the only S&P 500 sector that has posted a gain so far this year -- have also fallen sharply in recent weeks. That could be a sign traders are concerned about how a future recession might hit demand. \n\n     The same trend shows up in futures markets, where far-off contracts are trading at a discount to near-term deliveries. Brent crude for delivery at the end of December costs $101.27 a barrel, somewhat lower than the near-term price, according to FactSet. The price drops to less than $93 a barrel for December 2023 deliveries. \n\n     As geopolitics roil commodity markets, governments have stepped in to try to ease conditions for drivers and other energy consumers. Western leaders are struggling to balance two goals: inflicting economic pain on Russia, a major exporter, while stanching the runaway fuel prices that have battered their citizens' wallets. \n\n     This week, the Group of Seven club of wealthy democracies was working toward a global price cap on Russian oil, aimed at cutting revenue for Russian producers while keeping the country's crude exports flowing to willing buyers in Asia. The European Union earlier moved to ban seaborne imports of Russian oil by December. \n\n     Meanwhile, the Biden administration and allies of the U.S. have laid out plans to release hundreds of millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves this year to boost supply and ease prices. \n\n     Even so, moves like those haven't brought relief to fuel prices, in part because many refiners don't have the spare capacity to turn more oil into gasoline. Instead, U.S. producers are sending more crude abroad than ever before. Oil exports from the Gulf Coast likely hit a record 3.3 million barrels a day in the three months through June, research firm Rystad Energy estimated. \n\n     As supply concerns persist, there is little sign of easing prices for fuel consumers barring a recession that would ease demand for crude, Pimco analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. \n\n     \"Many commodity markets face a very fine balance this summer,\" the Pimco team said. \"Our concern now is that additional energy supply disruptions...will require demand rationing, since there is so little capacity to increase supply in the short term.\" \n\n     Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 30, 2022 08:24 ET (12:24 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270345Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:22:23.508309Z", "inner_id": 450, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5819, "annotations": [{"id": 6302, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "Lsv38tECch", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:23:01.877221Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:23:01.877256Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-04T21:22:57.172632Z", "lead_time": 37.647, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "25be03b8-13a0-44fd-8bc2-47d0669641cb", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5819, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "EMEA Morning Briefing: Hot Inflation Print Triggers Market Shock Waves as Next Fed Move Eyed\n\n  MARKET WRAPS \n\n  Watch For: \n\n  EU Long term interest rates statistics; UK Index of Production, Trade, Index of Services, Monthly GDP Estimates, Business Finance Review, NIESR Monthly GDP Tracker; Italy Labour Cost Index; OECD Composite Leading Indicators; no major corporate updates expected \n\n  Opening Call: \n\n  European shares face further steep losses as investors price a more aggressive Fed tightening path.

However, Phillip Securities said demand for safe haven assets like gold may be supported in the near term. \n\n  --- \n\n  Base metals weakened on the slump in risk appetite following the U.S. CPI data. ING said the market now expects not just more frontloading of the Fed's rate increases, but a higher peak as well. \n\n  Iron ore futures also fell sharply, although analysts said prices may be supported by hopes for stimulus measures from China. \n\n  The Chinese government is now looking to ramp up monetary and fiscal support, said Citi analysts, adding that the infrastructure construction pipeline still looks robust, although this is subject to Covid-19 lockdowns. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES \n\n  Earnings Are Under Threat, Another Blow to Sagging Stock Market \n\n  Stocks have fallen this year in the face of rising interest rates. With inflation showing little sign of cooling, many investors fear corporate earnings could be the market's next support to fall. \n\n  The S&P 500 has dropped 18% in 2022, its worst start to a year since 1962, as the Federal Reserve embarks on a rate-rising campaign to bring down four-decade-high inflation. The tightening of monetary policy has trampled on the rich valuations stocks carried at the start of the year, leaving earnings growth as a key pillar for the market to regain its footing. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Food Prices to Keep Going Up, as Costs Surge \n\n  Some of the nation's biggest food suppliers and restaurants, including Kraft Heinz Co. and some McDonald's Corp. franchisees, said they would continue to raise prices as they face starkly higher costs. \n\n  Kraft Heinz notified retailer customers this past Monday that it would raise prices in August on items ranging from Miracle Whip and Classico pasta sauce to Maxwell House coffee products and some deli meat. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Japan's Yen Usually Benefits When Markets Get Ugly. Not This Time \n\n  A surge of U.S. inflation is hammering the Japanese yen, a currency that typically strengthens on bad economic news. \n\n  The yen is approaching its weakest point since 2002, stuck between a strong U.S. dollar and Japan's easy-money policy. The dollar rose as the global economy's prospects dimmed, hurt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a jump in U.S. inflation and an economic slowdown in China. An index that measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies is up more than 12% over the past year. The dollar has advanced 22% against the yen during that time. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Pandemic, War in Ukraine Create New Challenges for Struggling WTO \n\n  WASHINGTON-Fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine are creating new challenges for the World Trade Organization, which has struggled in recent years to play its role as the regulator and arbiter of global trade. \n\n  Trade ministers gathering in Geneva this week for the first meeting of top officials from WTO member countries since 2017 face a mountain of pressing issues, including increasing food security amid war-induced shortages and responding to the continuing pandemic, as well as resolving long-running issues such as depletion of global fishing stocks. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Gasoline Prices Reach $5 a Gallon Nationwide for the First Time \n\n  The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. hit $5 Friday night, and the rise in fuel costs is expected to persist throughout the busy summer driving season. \n\n  The record high, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider, comes as U.S. consumer inflation hit its highest level in 40 years and crude oil prices remain high. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Abandon Stocks for Bonds? If Only Life Were So Simple. \n\n  The good news: At last, there is a worthwhile alternative to stocks. Bonds sport far more attractive yields than they have in years. \n\n  The bad news: Benchmark U.S. Treasurys have been crushed this year alongside stocks. Both the 10-year bond and the S&P 500 were down an unlucky 13% for the year up to the middle of this week, although stocks were then hit much harder by Friday's bad inflation figures than bonds were. Meanwhile junk bonds, the highest-yielding corporate bonds, bring similar exposure to a potential worsening of corporate fundamentals as shares. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Macron's Majority in French Parliament at Risk in Neck-and-Neck Races \n\n  PARIS-President Emmanuel Macron was at risk of losing his majority in the National Assembly after projections based on early ballot counts of the first round of France's parliamentary elections Sunday showed his candidates running neck and neck with leftist rivals, complicating the French leader's efforts to press ahead with his pro-business agenda. \n\n  A projection by polling firm Harris Interactive estimated that Mr. Macron's candidates and those of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon each garnered 25% of the nationwide tally. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally won 19% of the first-round vote while the conservative Les R\u00e9publicains and its allies garnered 11.5%, according to Harris Interactive. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Three-Dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine Works Safely in Young Children, Review Says \n\n  Three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE were effective at preventing symptomatic disease in children ages 6 months through 4 years in studies, according to U.S. health regulators. \n\n  The FDA staff also said, in a review of study data posted online Sunday, that there were no new safety concerns using the vaccine in young children compared with older age groups. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Write to paul.larkins@dowjones.com \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Expected Major Events for Monday \n\n  06:00/NOR: Apr Monthly GDP \n\n  06:00/UK: Apr Index of Production \n\n  06:00/UK: Apr UK trade \n\n  06:00/UK: Apr Index of services \n\n  06:00/UK: Apr Monthly GDP estimates \n\n  07:00/TUR: Apr Industrial Production Index \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 13, 2022 00:06 ET (04:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270385Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:23:02.108050Z", "inner_id": 451, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5820, "annotations": [{"id": 6303, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "HzePB6BbKx", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:23:23.139756Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:23:23.139781Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 20.154, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "19d6e55b-3b68-449f-a7c2-dc27819fbb50", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5820, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Turkey Annual Inflation Rate Neared 80% in June\n\n \n\n  By Nihad Ahmed \n\n \n\n  Turkey's annual rate of inflation surged even further in June, recording its highest print since September 1998, the country's statistics office Turkstat said Monday. \n\n  The consumer price index rose 78.6% in June compared with the same month of 2021.

It took the company seven years to get approval and construct a separate battery storage project in that state. \n\n     \"It's only getting harder and harder to get things done in California, specifically, but in every market,\" said President and General Manager Michael Arndt. \n\n     Wait times can be years for other projects that could also help alleviate energy shortages, such as high-voltage power lines to carry electricity between regions, natural gas pipelines and offshore wind farms capable of generating large amounts of clean power. These require land and ecological studies that many stakeholders say are critical to protecting wildlife, nearby industries and other interests. \n\n     The strain is already evident in the Midwest, where Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. operates a regional grid across multiple states. One of its biggest challenges, said Chief Executive John Bear, is how to replace coal- and gas-fired power plants that can produce power on demand with wind and solar farms where output fluctuates with weather and time of day. \n\n     When electricity supplies get tight, MISO calls on every available generator to produce power in what's known as a \"MaxGen\" event, something that rarely occurred before 2016. Since then, MISO has had more than 40 MaxGen events, a number of which occurred outside the summer months, when demand is typically highest. \n\n     MISO this past week approved a sweeping plan to build high-voltage power lines to help balance supplies, though the projects aren't expected to be complete until 2030. It is also considering how to better compensate power plants for operating on standby to slow the pace of closures. \"The transition may require some scaffolding, and that scaffolding may be some gas plants,\" Mr. Bear said. \n\n     Project delays -- coupled with higher gas prices -- present new challenges for utilities, too. They are paying more to produce or purchase electricity while planning big spending increases to upgrade aging infrastructure and prepare for new energy demands. \n\n     Xcel Energy Inc., a Minneapolis-based utility company serving parts of eight Western and Midwestern states, is wrestling with slowdowns on solar projects. Those include contracts with solar farms in Colorado that were scheduled to be online in late 2022 and early 2023. \n\n     Xcel, through one of its subsidiaries, is now working on contingency plans to ensure adequate supplies for next summer. It plans to invest $26 billion between 2022 and 2026 partly so it can build more high-voltage power lines to carry more power from new wind and solar farms. \n\n     Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said higher energy prices pose near-term challenges for the company and its customers, but he expects they will fall with time. The war in Ukraine, the pandemic and supply chain snarls, he added, would have been easier to manage if they didn't converge. \n\n     \"You put those three factors in a mixing bowl, and you come up with a bigger challenge,\" Mr. Frenzel said. \n\n     'No one knows what to do' \n\n     The actions of the U.S. government also contributed to this current crisis. Federal decisions made over the last three decades to encourage competition, lower costs for consumers, sell oil and gas to foreign buyers and encourage the development of more renewable sources are having unintended consequences now that the energy market is in turmoil. \n\n     It began with the decision to deregulate the electricity industry, a movement that first gained support following the energy shortages of the 1970s and gathered more momentum with the 1992 passage of the Energy Policy Act, which encouraged competition among wholesale electricity suppliers. The federal government also lifted price caps on natural gas and created incentives for more renewable energy sources to take root in markets around the country, hoping to prop up technologies that didn't rely on oil and gas. \n\n     What this new system created in the subsequent decades was a patchwork of markets across much of the country with different regional operators, leaving state regulators and power grid managers to do much of the planning. Coordination across regions became more challenging as states set different goals to reduce carbon emissions. \n\n     Consider what happened in California when the state experienced rolling blackouts in 2020 after temperatures rose across the West. The state had substantially reduced its reliance on gas-fired power plants in recent years in favor of renewable energy, giving way to evening supply crunches on hot days when solar production tapers off. California has historically imported a lot of power from neighboring states in times of need, but it was constrained in its ability to do so during the 2020 heat wave because neighboring states also had numerous plants close and thus had less power to spare. \n\n     \"You had too much capacity come off the market too quickly and now all the markets are scrambling for reliability,\" said John Arnold, a former natural gas trader who now is a billionaire philanthropist. \n\n     Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden all encouraged U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas. The U.S. became the world's top LNG exporter this year as it sent huge volumes to Europe to help replace Russian supplies. But those same exports are now driving up domestic gas prices because U.S. consumers are effectively competing for supplies with foreign buyers, say analysts, and will keep prices elevated for years to come due to long-term supply contracts signed by exporters. \n\n     The U.S. government has more recently taken steps to help with the nation's transition to renewable energy sources. For example, it expanded its authority to intervene in state-level permitting processes for high-voltage power lines as a way of helping balance electricity supply and demand across regions. Mr. Biden is also trying to lower high energy prices by asking Saudi Arabia, which he had vowed to treat as a \"pariah\" after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to pump more crude.

Revenue increased by almost 16 % year-on-year, of \nwhich Sweden's share was approximately 9%-points. Acquisitions \ncontributed about a half of the revenue growth in Finland. Booking rates \nfor health services remained very high and supply limited organic sales \ngrowth in most services. The supply that fell short of the targets, the \nweakened sales mix and the personnel costs raised by acquisitions, among \nother things, weighed on profitability despite strong demand and growth. \nAdjusted EBITA decreased by 18.2 percent to 24.1 million euros and was \n7.6 percent of the revenue. \n \nThe supply grew modestly compared to a year ago, still focusing on \ndigital services. However, we succeeded in recruiting new professionals \nduring the period and the number of private practitioners increased by \nmore than 10 percent. This positive development will be reflected in the \nactual supply figures with a delay. To strengthen the supply, we are \nmoving even more of our development efforts into solutions that help our \nprofessionals work more efficiently. Job satisfaction at Terveystalo \ncontinues at high level with Employee Net Promoter Score, eNPS reaching \n30 in the latest survey. \n \nThe number of Covid-19 tests decreased according to our assumptions, \nwhile other diagnostics are yet to return to the pre-pandemic levels. \nThe sales mix was also negatively affected by the supply falling short \nof the targets, as the appointments of contracted customers took \ncapacity from higher-margin private customer care chains. Personnel \ncosts increased because of acquisitions, growth investments in new \nbusinesses, and proactive recruitment. \n \nThe Swedish business continued to develop according to our plans. In the \nsecond quarter, we continued with complementary acquisitions and \nexpanded the range of services for new payer groups. \n \nThe number of digital appointments continued to grow strongly, 28 \npercent year-on-year. Outside of our own services, Terveystalo's digital \nsolutions are being piloted for the first time by public sector \ncustomers. Our goal is to continue to lead the renewal of our industry \nin Finland, Sweden and in the future in new markets. With more efficient \nuse of health data, better care management and the use of digital \nappointments it is possible to improve access to care, job satisfaction, \nas well as productivity . During the fall, in addition to developing \ndigital partnerships in the public healthcare, we will take the \noccupational health digital suite to Sweden. \n \nTerveystalo's market position and competitiveness are strong. We have \ngrown rapidly, especially in digital services, new businesses, and the \nSwedish market, and have exceeded our growth targets many times over. In \na strong demand environment, our focus has been on growth and customer \nexperience, which is also reflected in relatively faster growing \npersonnel costs. In an environment where inflationary pressures are \ncombined with a tight labor market and general economic uncertainty, we \nwill emphasize profitability in relation to growth. We continue to \ninvest in the long-term competitiveness of our business, but the \nchanging environment will be reflected in investment priorities, \ncriteria for acquisitions in new business areas and timing of \nrecruitments. We also need to review the pricing of our services so that \nit is in line with the general cost level increase. \n \nThe megatrends driving demand for health services have intensified \nduring the pandemic, and despite economic uncertainty, demand is very \nhigh. Our mission to fight for a healthier life is more relevant than \never, and as the leading private healthcare service provider in our core \nmarket, we play a key role in the lives of people and work communities. \nWe are committed to our vision of creating a world with fewer sick days \nand more healthy, happy years. \n \nTowards a better tomorrow, \n \nVille Iho \n \nOutlook \n \n  \u00b7 Demand for health services is very strong and broad based. However, \ngrowth is restricted by supply. Tight labour market and rising inflation \ncreate growing pressure on operating costs, including wages. \n  \u00b7 The demand for services related to COVID-19 is expected to decrease. \nHowever, predicting the volume is difficult. The overall demand for \nhealth services is expected to remain at a high level. The demand for \ndigital services is expected to continue to grow. \n  \u00b7 Demand from corporate customers for preventive and statutory \noccupational health services is expected to develop favourably. Demand \nfor medical care is expected to continue strong. Significant changes in \nthe employment rate may be reflected in the underlying demand. \n  \u00b7 Overall demand is expected to remain strong in the private customer \nsegment. Significant decline in general consumer confidence may, \nhowever, be reflected in the demand. \n  \u00b7 Demand from the public sector is expected to remain strong in \noccupational health, service sales, and staffing services. Revenue from \nthe outsourcing business is expected to remain stable. Tight labour \nmarket creates pressure especially on the salary costs of new and \nreplacement recruitments in staffing and outsourcing services. \n  \u00b7 Demand in the Swedish occupational health market is expected to \ndevelop favourably due to pent-up demand in the wake of the pandemic. \n \nThese views are based on the expected development of demand for \nTerveystalo' s services within the next six months, compared with the \npast six months. \n \nThe impacts of COVID-19 and the measures taken by Terveystalo \n \nDuring the second quarter of 2022, in Terveystalo' s service production \nthe share of various COVID-19-related services decreased year-on-year. \nWell-being and digital services continued to grow. \n \nThe impacts of the war in Ukraine \n \nThe indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine on Terveystalo are assessed \nto be minimal, as Terveystalo does not have business operations in, or \nwith, countries that are subject to sanctions. Indirect impacts of the \nwar may arise from supply chain disruptions, rising inflation, or \npotential disruptions in the financial markets. The war may also have a \ndelayed economic impact through declining consumer purchasing power and \nemployment. If the situation were to be prolonged, this could have a \nnegative impact on the demand for Terveystalo's services. In \nprocurement, higher prices have been reflected in the prices of certain \nsupplies (material purchasing accounts for approximately 3% of operating \nexpenditure), but the most significant purchasing agreements for 2022 \nhave already been concluded.  The rising price of electricity affects \noperating expenditure, but its impact at the Group level is relatively \nminor. Delivery times have become longer in certain categories of \nproducts and materials, such as healthcare equipment, due to component \nshortages. \n \nRising inflation creates growing pressure to increase wages. Wage \nincreases are determined by collective bargaining in the Finnish \nhealthcare industry regarding nurses, for example (approximately 43% of \nemployees). Wage inflation is also visible in other professionals' \nrecruitments. Most of the physicians who work for Terveystalo are \nprivate practitioners (approximately 96%). The financial risk associated \nwith inflation is mitigated by Terveystalo's ability to price its \nservices. \n \nKey figures \n \n+-------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----- \n--+-------+ \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 19, 2022 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270488Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:24:34.106584Z", "inner_id": 454, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5823, "annotations": [{"id": 6306, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "zK1n8HDfK2", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:26:58.854332Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:26:58.854358Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 143.941, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "9706438e-c3ef-432f-a1b7-ddcee31eb8da", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5823, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "England&apos;s Coastal Villages Are Quaint and Charming. Second Home-Owners Are Taking the Bait. -- WSJ\n\n  By Ruth Bloomfield | Photographs and Videos by Adj Brown for The Wall Street Journal \n\n \n\n     The pandemic was a tipping point in the lives of Jilly and Alex Scott. \n\n     The couple lived in the affluent country town of Cheltenham, 95 miles west of London, and since 2016 owned a small cottage they used for vacations and weekends in St Mawes, a picturesque coastal fishing village in Cornwall, England's westernmost county. \n\n     But, while locked down in 2020, they decided that, rather than spend a few weeks a year by the sea, they would like to decamp permanently to Cornwall. Instead of moving into the four-bedroom house they already owned, they traded up to a larger property: a 1930s house overlooking the estuary of the Percuil River for which the Scotts, both 53, paid $1.15 million in 2020. The couple, founders and directors of Boo Homes, a boutique property developer, completed a $1.2 million renovation and moved in during August 2021. \n\n     The couple extended their new house from about 2,000 square feet to about 3,000 square feet, and estimate it is now worth around $3.6 million. This price growth is partly because, according to research from estate agent Hamptons, average prices in St Mawes have climbed 26% in the past two years, to $573,168. Mrs. Scott reports that the welcome from the local community has been warm, and the St Mawes lifestyle is everything she and her family had hoped for. Their downtime is spent on their boat, fishing, or at the beach. \n\n     The Scotts' experience is being replicated in small coastal enclaves around the UK. Capital-rich buyers from out-of-town, often Londoners, many of whom aren't expecting to return to the office, are relocating to charming, coastal communities. The result has been a series of housing booms in resort towns and villages that were already disproportionately expensive before two years of sustained growth. \n\n     While exponential price growth may be good news for owners, it is bad news for local people with average incomes who have been frozen out of the property market altogether. Danny O'Flynn was born and raised in Padstow, one of Cornwall's most fashionable resorts thanks to its fine restaurants and beautiful scenery. Prices in Padstow were among the highest in Cornwall prepandemic and have grown an additional 3% in the last two years, to hit $551,576. \n\n     Mr. O'Flynn, 42, is a master baker at The Chough Bakery and earns around $36,000 a year. In 2016, he and his wife, Paige, 30, had to move to the less expensive village of Trevone, two miles inland. Using a subsidized affordable housing scheme, they bought a two-bedroom house, which they live in with their three daughters, aged 7, 4 and 1. \n\n     \"We couldn't afford to live in Padstow, and the house we have got is too small for us,\" he said. \"I don't know what we are going to do. A lot of my friends have moved right away from Cornwall because of this problem. Because unless somebody in your family dies and leaves you some money or a house, you can't afford to buy a house in Padstow.\" \n\n     Mr. O'Flynn said his hometown has changed dramatically during his lifetime. \"Years ago nobody wanted to live in the little cottages along the quay,\" he said. \"Now they cost GBP750,000 [$898,650]. \"I remember when you knew everybody in the pubs and in the street in Padstow but they have all gone. The community is not what it was. It's sad, really.\" \n\n     Mr. O'Flynn recognizes the irony of his plight. Without tourism, he said, businesses like the bakery he works at would struggle. But he also knows that the influx of second-home owners and investors buying vacation rentals has driven up real-estate values. \"We need more of a happy medium,\" he said. \n\n     This phenomenon isn't confined to the west of England. In Wells-next-the-Sea, a tiny, pretty fishing village in the east coast county of Norfolk, average sale prices have jumped 69% in the past decade to $556,397, around 50% more than the county average of $352,331.Competition for homes is fierce. Johnny Lane, residential sales manager at William H Brown estate agents, recently sold a four-bedroom, roughly 1,300-square-foot house without a sea view for $144,000 above its $569,287 asking price after 26 buyers viewed it in a single day. \n\n     \"To be honest, most buyers are from outside the area because local people have been priced out,\" he said. \"I would say that around 85% of buyers are from outside Norfolk, certainly outside Wells.\" \n\n     In Mumbles, a fishing village in south Wales turned property gold mine, Hamptons found that its average sale prices jumped 24% in the past two years to $468,454. Chris Hope, senior partner at the village's Fine & Country estate agents, said that with the sea on one side and a stretch of protected countryside on the other, there are few opportunities for new-home construction and demand vastly exceeds supply. \n\n     This means that a three-bedroom cottage with a sea view would sell for around $599,000. \"If you moved that same property 4 miles inland it would probably cost about GBP150,000 [$180,000],\" said Mr. Hope. \n\n     One of the most extreme examples of how coastal prices have spiraled is to be found in Salcombe, a chic sailing village in Cornwall's neighboring county, Devon. Hamptons found that average sale prices have grown 60% in a decade to hit close to $1 million. \n\n     Competitive bidding has become the norm in Salcombe rather than a rarity, said Victoria Lambden, manager of Marchand Petit estate agents. She recently sold a roughly 700-square-foot apartment, listed with a guide price of $898,000, for just under $1.2 million after eight bidders made offers. A four-bedroom house on the outskirts of the town, with a guide price of $952,000, sold for $1.265 million after 18 bids were received. \n\n     Back in St Mawes, Mark Willson, managing director of H Tiddy estate agents, reports that his firm has sold double the number of homes a year during the pandemic than it did in previous years, with prices hitting $1,557 to $1,677 per square foot for homes with a sea view. \n\n     Mr. Willson has sold two three- to four-bedroom cottages overlooking St Mawes harbor in the past two years for in excess of $2.4 million. But despite these stiff prices, Mr. Willson's list of prospective buyers has grown from 1,500 people to more than 4,000 during the pandemic. \n\n     While business is brisk for real-estate agents, many local people share Mr. O'Flynn's concerns. In summer 2021, Cath Navin was inspired to co-found the group First Not Second Homes to help the longtime residents of communities around the U.K. who feel they are being engulfed by new arrivals. \n\n     \"It is impossible for young people to buy, and expensive to rent, so they are being driven away,\" said Mrs. Navin, 51, who has lived in Cornwall most of her life and runs a catering company. She is particularly concerned by people who buy holiday homes that are only used for a few weeks a year, or who outbid locals to buy properties to rent out to tourists. \"We have 21,000 homeless people in Cornwall, so I think that is a legitimate gripe,\" she said. \n\n     Ms. Navin would like to see tough government action, including a ban on selling newly built homes to vacation-home owners, restrictions on the number of owners allowed to offer short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb, and greater investment in social housing, including, controversially, the forced purchase of vacation properties left empty for most of the year. \n\n     To date, political response has been muted. The Queen's Speech, an annual announcement of forthcoming legislation planned by the British Government, delivered this year by Prince Charles, unveiled plans to give towns and villages powers to double the local taxes payable by owners of second homes left empty. \n\n     Mr. Lane is doubtful a bill for around $1,000 to $2,000 a year will make much difference to buyers able to pay a typical $720,000 for a two-bedroom apartment with sea views.\"You can rent a two-bedroom cottage out for up to GBP1,500 ($1,800) a week in high season, so that will cover your extra tax bill in just a week,\" he said. \n\n     Angus Lugsdin, 45, and his wife, Andrea Lugsdin, 44, moved to Devon in 2011. In 2020, the couple, who have daughters aged 3 and 6, needed a larger home and spent $503,000 on what they call a \"neglected\" three-bedroom Victorian cottage just outside Salcombe's borders which they plan to renovate. He suspects rising prices mean it would cost more like $743,000 today. \n\n     Although most locals would still class the family as newcomers, Mr. Lugsdin said he feels he has added value to the local community over the past 11 years. In 2014, he and a friend from his teenage years, Howard Davies, set up Salcombe Distilling Co., which produces Salcombe Gin and employs around 55 local people. Similarly, the Scotts said their property firm has begun building and renovating homes in St Mawes, employing local people. \n\n     Mr. Lugsdin said he sympathizes with staff members who complain they can't afford a home because wealthy second-home owners can easily outbid them. \n\n     \"If you drive into Salcombe in the winter, it is very dark in the evenings because they are all second homes and nobody is there,\" he said. \n\n     Listings \n\n     $712,500 \n\n     A two-bedroom, one-bathroom fisherman's cottage set on the waterfront overlooking St Mawes harbor.

Lithium miners Lynas, Mineral Resources, Pilbara Minerals and Liontown put on between 4.5% and 7.4%. Gold miner St Barbara jumped 9.6% after hitting its fiscal-year output guidance. The ASX 200 added 2.1% for the week. \n\n  COMMODITIES \n\n  Oil futures finished higher, but logged a weekly loss as fears of recession outweighed tight global supplies of crude. \n\n  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery climbed 2% to settle at $104.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the front-month contract posting a 3.4% weekly fall. September Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 2.3% to $107.02 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, but suffered a 4.1% weekly decline. \n\n  Oil prices extended their gains for the day in the wake of a stronger-than-expected reading on U.S. job creation in June, which helped to ease worries about a possible recession that would hurt energy demand. \n\n  Gold prices settled higher, after briefly slipping back in the wake of better-than-expected U.S. jobs data, but posted a fourth-consecutive weekly loss as overall strength in the U.S. dollar pressured commodity prices. \n\n  August gold August tacked on nearly 0.2% to $1,742.30 per ounce. Prices for the most-active contract, which settled Wednesday at their lowest since late September 2021, marked a weekly loss of 3.3%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES \n\n  Fed Officials Flag Tight Jobs Market, Tout Need to Control Inflation \n\n  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Friday that the U.S. central bank must bring \"sky high\" inflation under control, and predicted that a notable slowdown in growth and rising unemployment are coming to the economy. \n\n  \"The economy experienced a rapid recovery from the pandemic last year, but I expect growth to slow considerably this year as the waning effects of fiscal stimulus, less favorable financial conditions, and slower growth abroad all weigh on our economy,\" Mr. Williams said in the text of a speech. \n\n  The policy maker sees U.S. gross-domestic-product growth moderating to a less than 1% rise this year with the current 3.6% unemployment rate rising to \"somewhat above\" 4% by next year. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.S. Added 372,000 Jobs in June \n\n  Employers continued to snap up workers in June-though at a slower pace than earlier in the year-in an economy that is otherwise cooling rapidly under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates. \n\n  The U.S. economy added 372,000 jobs in June, the Labor Department said Friday. Hiring gains last month held near the previous three months, when companies added an average of nearly 400,000 workers, but slipped from higher totals early in the year. \n\n  \"The labor market is cooling from a red-hot pace, but it's far from going into a freeze,\" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \"It's hard to get a broad retrenchment in activity when you have 372,000 more individuals receiving paychecks.\" \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Housing-Affordability Index Drops to Lowest Level Since 2006 \n\n  Record home prices and higher mortgage rates in May made it the most expensive month since 2006 to buy a home, prompting more buyers to give up and pressuring sellers to cut asking prices. \n\n  The National Association of Realtors' housing-affordability index fell to 102.5 in May, the association said Friday, the lowest level since the index fell to 100.5 in July 2006. It was close to the lowest level since July 1990, when the index stood at 100.2. The affordability index incorporates median existing-home prices, median family incomes and average mortgage rates. \n\n  On a national basis, homebuying was relatively affordable in 2020 and last year, thanks to record-low mortgage rates even as strong demand sent home prices skyrocketing. But this year, mortgage rates have moved up sharply and house prices have climbed to new highs nationwide. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Japan's Shinzo Abe Championed Economy's Revival, Bolstered National Defense \n\n  TOKYO-Shinzo Abe, who served longer than anyone as Japan's prime minister and bolstered the nation's defense while struggling to lift its economy, died Friday at the hands of an assassin's bullet. He was 67. \n\n  Mr. Abe served as prime minister from December 2012 to September 2020, the longest consecutive reign since Japan created a European-style government led by a prime minister in the late 19th century. He also occupied the job in an earlier stint from 2006 to 2007 and held the record for most total days in office. \n\n  The heir to a political dynasty, Mr. Abe championed a revival in the economic and military strength of a country that began to stagnate in the 1990s after its meteoric rise from defeat in World War II. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Elon Musk Says He is Terminating Twitter Deal \n\n  Elon Musk says he is terminating his agreement to buyTwitter Inc., saying the company \"is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement\" and appears to have made \"false and misleading representations\" when entering into the agreement, according to a regulatory filing Friday. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Calls for TikTok Probe Widen, Adding to Pressure on Biden to Weigh In \n\n  WASHINGTON-Calls for an investigation into the security risks posed by the video app TikTok are widening, adding to pressure on President Biden to make good on his year-old promise to get tough on apps that could share Americans' personal data with foreign adversaries. \n\n  The Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the panel's top Republican sent a joint letter to the Federal Trade Commission this week urging an investigation of TikTok's data-handling and other practices. TikTok's parent, ByteDance Ltd., has its headquarters in Beijing. \n\n  The letter from Sens. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) followed reports by BuzzFeed that ByteDance's employees in China have repeatedly accessed U.S. users' personal data. \n\n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n\n  Expected Major Events for Monday \n\n  06:00/JPN: Jun Preliminary Machine Tool Orders \n\n  21:00/NZ: Jun REINZ Monthly Housing Price Index \n\n  21:00/NZ: Jun REINZ Residential Market Report \n\n  23:50/JPN: Jun Corporate Goods Price Index \n\n  All times in GMT.

Previously he served in the White House, State Department, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. \n\n     Latin America just suffered a lost decade. Again. And now, after an initial post-Covid burst, economies have slowed and projections for future growth remain sluggish. Exasperated voters are demanding change, both in the streets and the voting booths, punishing leaders unwilling or unable to deliver the improving quality of life they have repeatedly promised but never quite delivered. Election after election, when offered the chance, voters are selecting untried, nontraditional leaders -- sometimes even risky political outsiders -- who promise big results and easy solutions. \n\n     Hand wringing in Washington about a leftward lurch, or the counternarrative of an anti-incumbency wave, both miss the point. Rather, the new crop of leaders is defined by a common desire to increase state-led economic and social intervention, in some cases without a moderating political give and take or adherence to democratic niceties. \n\n     Leaders don't actually articulate the vision this way, of course. They talk about fairness and reducing inequality and increasing individual rights (but not property rights) and strengthening favored constituencies and sectors of the economy. Several of these are appropriate, even necessary, ambitions. Latin America, after all, really does have the world's worst income inequality profile, which shamefully persists. Indigenous rights have routinely been trampled. Quality education and true economic opportunity are not widely shared. \n\n     To make matters substantially worse, the Covid pandemic both deepened and highlighted regional inefficiencies and inequalities, making them unavoidable to all but those wearing blinkers, forcing the current political reckoning. Citizens are now, understandingly, seeking solutions. In Chile, that means efforts to rewrite the constitution and social contract. In Colombia, income redistribution and rural development are high priorities of the new government, as well as greater control of the energy and mining sectors. In El Salvador, it's a radical effort by the president to bring gangs under control. In Mexico, even before the pandemic began, the president embarked on a classic strategy of state-led development, including unnecessary and inefficient infrastructure projects, a recapture of the heretofore liberalized energy sector, and the militarization and recentralization of the security forces. In Brazil, when the two leading candidates for the October presidential elections aren't comparing each other to Satan, they are attempting to outcompete each other on populist promises. \n\n     While seemingly unrelated, what these priorities all have in common is that, if fully implemented, they would dramatically increase the role of the state in each respective economy. And they are popular. But the path to get there is fraught with politics, personal ambition, and untrained officials, exacerbated by judiciaries that may lack impartiality. \n\n     Success relies on qualified, public-spirited, uncorrupted officials to put public rather than private interests first. To put it diplomatically, such a scenario has not always been in evidence across the region. As a result, an expanded state role is often more likely to exacerbate pre-existing economic and social problems rather than to improve them. Scarce resources are inefficiently allocated as the weight of the state is placed on the scales of normal political and economic discourse. Private interests work to capture greater rents rather than innovating and investing according to economic signals, seeking favorable tax and regulatory treatment, contracts, and market protections while squeezing out competition, squelching entrepreneurialism, and harming consumers. History shows that growing authoritarianism and corruption generally follow unless counterbalancing institutions including the judiciary, legislature, and the press remain vibrant and independent. \n\n     In fact, despite recent political diagnoses, Latin America's economic problems are not the result of too little state involvement in economies, but rather too much. The idea of the \"lost decade\" was first coined in the 1980s to describe a persistent lack of regional growth engendered by sclerotic economies and over-centralization. It midwifed an urgent effort to institute democratic governance, relatively orthodox economic management including opening markets, and a conscious effort to limit the heavy hand of the state in economic affairs leading to a more efficient and fairer distribution of rents. Growth returned and poverty decreased as high inflation retreated, currencies stabilized, and investment increased. Business cycles continued, but wild swings appeared to be in the past, making longer-term planning possible. \n\n     But the reform effort was short-circuited by the commodities super cycle earlier this century, driven by China, that flooded the region with easy money. It masked the deep economic and social imbalances that continued to persist while reducing incentives for leaders to adhere to previous policy commitments. Growth was real but ephemeral, as resources were squandered on current spending, giveaways to favored groups, and corruption rather than strategic investment or the creation of space for needed reforms. Special interests weakened reforms. \n\n     Leaders benefited handsomely until the money ran out. When it did, a new wave of leaders beginning in 2015 was elected to clean up the mess, but they had limited resources to work with after the excesses of their predecessors. Indeed, some were themselves corrupted, further reducing public trust and increasing the attractiveness of outsider candidates. The region now faces higher debt loads, increasing inflation and interest rates, and continued pandemic overhang, in large measure with leaders who lack the benefit of traditional political experience and who may not feel bound by democratic best practices. Meanwhile, the United States continues to lose standing across the hemisphere by exhibiting scant interest in regional trade expansion or meaningful economic engagement including debt relief. The temptation to turn to China for relief is real, despite the many political, security, and economic drawbacks of closer association with Beijing. \n\n     Ultimately, the best way to unlock broad based, sustainable economic development across the region is to reduce, rather than expand, the levers of state influence and control. Attracting and keeping constructive capital, both domestic and foreign, is the key. A sense of urgency is critical as the world looks for greater supply chain efficiencies stemming from the Covid pandemic, Russia's assault on Ukraine, and potential instability in the South China Sea. \n\n     Desirable actions are as prosaic as they are powerful. Reduction of burdensome, ineffective, and obsolete regulations including restrictive labor codes. Market-led infrastructure development. True commitment to broad based education and health sectors reform. Active steps toward trade liberalization. Privatization of state assets. Improved citizen security and rule of law. \n\n     None of these are secrets or magic bullets. But all are required for Latin America to achieve its highest potential. And each of these is within the capacity and competence of states to achieve. It's when governments overstretch, as they have done since colonial days and are tempted to do again, that problems deepen. \n\n     Equality of opportunity has never really existed across most of Latin America. It is now central to voters' demands. Governments must begin to pay attention. We will know that they are when, instead of working to expand their own influence and authority, they work assiduously to create a level, transparent playing field for their citizens and then back intentionally away. It may be the triumph of hope over experience, to quote Samuel Johnson, but the high chances of future lost decades suggest it's time to try. \n\n     Guest commentaries like this one are written by authors outside the Barron's and MarketWatch newsroom.

It is also very satisfying that, during the \nquarter, we took an important step and strengthened our position through \nthe acquisition of Koivunen, affording us a market-leading position in \nFinland and Estonia. The acquisition also expands our operations to \nLatvia and Lithuania. At the same time, generally rising inflation has \ncreated a cautious trend in several of our markets, which, combined with \nunfavorable currency fluctuations, impacted our profitability during the \nquarter. We now put full focus on using our insights, by acting \ndecisively and methodically to ensure continued profitable growth. \n \nAcquisition of Koivunen - a key step \nFor many years, MEKO has had a successful strategy for creating value \nthrough carefully selected acquisitions. On July 1 when Koivunen became \na part of MEKO, we have established ourselves as the leading player in \nFinland, where we previously had limited operations, and in Estonia, \nwhere we were not represented at all. The acquisition also expands our \noperations to Latvia and Lithuania. The company had 1,740 MSEK in net \nsales and an EBIT margin of 5.6 percent in 2021. The distribution \nchannels include concept-affiliated and independent workshops \nanddistributors, industrial customers and export. Koivunen is a \nprosperous company with strong brands that will continue to be developed \nin their existing form as a separate business area. This important step \neastward means that we are closing in on our goal of becoming the best \nand most comprehensive partner for everyone that services and maintains \nvehicles in Northern Europe. \n \nCautious trend in several markets while Poland reports strong growth \nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a humanitarian crisis with \nmany other knock-on effects, such as challenges related to sourcing of \nmaterials and increased prices, combined with currency fluctuations and \nrising inflation. This, combined with high energy and fuel prices, \nresulted in reduced consumer purchasing power and, consequently as \ncautious trend in several of our markets during the quarter. The \nNorwegian and, to a certain extent, the Danish market were affected to a \ngreater extent. For the Group as a whole, net sales increased by 5 \npercent to SEK 3,357 M (3,210) during the second quarter, which is \nconfirmation of the stability of our underlying business. Organic growth \namounted to slightly more than 2 percent, with Inter-Team in Poland \nstanding out in a positive sense with its organic growth of more than 8 \npercent. \n \nCurrency fluctuations and cost increases impacted profitability \nProfitability for the second quarter was impacted by the changes in the \nmarket. EBIT amounted to SEK 185 M (280) and the EBIT margin to 5 \npercent (9). A total of SEK -26 M (-) in items affecting comparability \nrelated to the acquisition of Koivunen was charged to earnings for the \nquarter. Adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 240 M (314) and the adjusted EBIT \nmargin to 7 percent (10). The gross margin rose to 46.3 percent (45.5), \nlargely thanks to previously implemented price adjustments. The change \nin earnings compared with the corresponding quarter of the preceding \nyear was due in full to cost increases resulting from generally higher \ninflationary pressure combined with unfavorable currency fluctuations. \nThe situation is being managed resolutely and methodically, and we are \ndrawing on our tried-and-tested ability to transform. We launched \nseveral targeted activities in various parts of the operations to reduce \nour cost base and secure long-term profitable growth. Our flexibility, \ntogether with our underlying stable business, makes me confident that \nthe efforts are having the intended effect. \n \nSolid financial position enables accessibility and continued growth \nOur financial position remains solid. After the end of the quarter, we \nsigned a new credit facility agreement of SEK 1,965 M, which replaces \nearlier financing of EUR 178 M. This provides us with both flexibility \nand strong resilience. Net debt amounted to SEK 2,649 M (2,549) at the \nend of the second quarter and net debt/EBITDA excluding effects of IFRS \n16 amounted to 2.4 times (2.0), which is in the lower end of our target \nrange. Cash flow from operating activities was positive during the \nquarter and amounted to SEK 387 M (406). We can see major opportunities \nto increase sales and market shares going forward through responsible \ninvestment in increased availability for our customers. Our strategic \ndecision to strengthen our stocks of attractive components and spare \nparts stands firm and we are now at approximately the same levels as at \nthe close of the first quarter. \n \nWell equipped to continue our journey \nI can confirm that we have a fundamentally stable business and that we \nhave demonstrated that we can manage difficulties and challenging market \nconditions. Today, MEKO has many established brands, covering various \nwishes and needs, which together with our proven ability to balance our \ncost base and extract synergies, will enable continued long-term, \nsustainable growth and profitability. We stand well equipped to now \nfurther strengthen our position in all of our markets through \ntransformation toward an even more sustainable and profitable company. \nWe aim to be the best and most complete partner for everyone that \nservices and maintains vehicles in our markets - today and in the \nfuture. \n \nPehr Oscarson \nPresident and CEO \n \nThis information is such information that MEKO AB (publ) is obliged to \nmake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the \nSecurities Market Act.

That in turn pulled down Treasury yields, which largely reflect the expected path of short-term rates. \n\n     In recent trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 2.756%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 2.797% Tuesday. \n\n     The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to changes in the near-term interest rate outlook, dropped to 3.132% from 3.284% Tuesday. \n\n     Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said after the report that it is still \"way too early\" for the Fed, or investors, to declare victory over inflation. Still, he said, \"the softer print takes some of the pressure\" off the Fed to raise rates by another 0.75 percentage point in September and sets the stage for a more robust debate among officials about the proper way forward. \n\n     Even before Wednesday's data, longer-term Treasury yields in particular had come a long way off of their highs reached in mid-June, when the 10-year yield nearly touched 3.5%. \n\n     After ratcheting up their interest-rate expectations for most of the year, investors in recent weeks have started betting more heavily that the U.S. economy will soon enter a recession -- if it isn't in one already -- forcing the Fed to eventually start cutting interest rates in order to stimulate growth. \n\n     The trend toward lower yields was interrupted on Friday when investors were confronted with a surprisingly strong jobs report. But longer-term yields had already started to edge down again earlier this week. \n\n     Wednesday's rally in bonds was particularly evident among shorter-term Treasurys. \n\n     The 10-year yield initially fell as low as 2.673% after the inflation report but then retraced a large portion of that decline. \n\n     That reversal reflected a basic calculation among investors that what the Fed does in the near term could alter its course over the longer term, analysts said. \n\n     Many investors believe that if the Fed raises rates aggressively now, it is more likely to cause a severe recession that would lead to more rate cuts later. As a result, shorter-term yields have climbed above longer-term yields -- a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has often been a harbinger of recessions. \n\n     Wednesday's move, though, made the yield curve slightly less inverted, reflecting bets that the Fed might have a better chance of avoiding a damaging economic slowdown. \n\n     Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 10, 2022 14:00 ET (18:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270706Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:32:10.275258Z", "inner_id": 460, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5829, "annotations": [{"id": 6312, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "3lBN83mQNo", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:32:23.941611Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:32:23.941637Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 12.922, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "0763c003-7174-4f98-a7df-b2ef73f8df2d", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5829, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Global Energy Roundup: Market Talk\n\n   The latest Market Talks covering Energy markets.

Normally these are minimal modifications, but given August's persistently high inflation data, tax experts estimate a significant impact on 2023 taxes.More of Americans' income will be taxed at lower rates next year, when the thresholds for income-tax brackets and the standard deduction are raised, thanks to automatic inflation adjustments built into the tax code, tax professionals say. A single taxpayer with $100,000 of adjusted gross income in 2023, could see a tax savings of about $500 compared to someone with the same income this year, according to Jim Young, an accounting professor at Northern Illinois University.Estate- and gift-tax thresholds are expected to go up, too, allowing a couple to shelter nearly $2 million more from these taxes. And the contribution limits will likely be raised for retirement plans, meaning more tax-advantaged savings.\"Over the last decade, inflation has been moderate, so we only saw minor increases in tax parameters each year,\" said Kyle Pomerleau, a federal tax policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \"This year, we will see a much larger adjustment as prices have risen much faster.\"The IRS makes the adjustments based on formulas set out in federal law that are somewhat different from headline inflation numbers. The Labor Department on Tuesday reported its consumer-price index was 8.3% higher in August than the same month a year ago.The tax-provision adjustments are tied to an alternate inflation measure called the chained consumer-price index, which takes into account the substitutions shoppers make as costs rise. The average of the chained CPI from September 2021 to August 2022 is used to calculate the 2023 adjustments, which the IRS will announce in October or November. These ultimately affect tax returns for the 2023 tax year filed in early 2024.\"Adjusting tax-return data for inflation was a purposeful decision by Congress intended to shield taxpayers from annual inflation,\" said Mr. Young. \"This will hopefully help taxpayers cope with rising prices.\" The benefits of these changes could be offset by inflation in other ways. If your wages have gone up, your total tax bill may not go down, Mr. Young said.Here are the estimates, for the IRS adjustments, according to the American Enterprise Institute:The threshold for the top federal income-tax bracket in 2023 is expected to climb by nearly $50,000 next year for married couples, and that 37% rate will apply to income above $693,750. For individuals, that top tax bracket will start at $578,125.Those levels and the other tax-bracket break points will all rise about 7% from tax year 2022, compared with about 3% last year, which was the largest increase in four years. This year's increase is the largest in the past 35 years, said Mr. Young.The Social Security wage base tax level is estimated to increase 5.5% from $147,000 to $155,100 in 2023, according to the 2022 Social Security Trustees Report.The standard deduction for married couples is expected to be $27,700 for 2023, up from $25,900 this year, and $13,850 for individuals, up from $12,950. This is the amount those who don't itemize deductions on their returns can subtract from their total earnings subject to income taxes.The federal estate-tax exclusion amount, what an individual can shelter from estate taxes, is $12.06 million this year. It is expected to increase to $12.92 million for 2023, meaning a married couple could shelter nearly $26 million from estate tax with little planning.The annual limit on tax-free gifts is expected to climb from $16,000 this year to $17,000 for 2023. The taxpayers who benefit from this are high-wealth individuals, said Mr. Young. They can give away more without estate- or gift-tax consequences.The maximum contribution amount for an individual retirement account is expected to jump to $6,500 for 2023, up from $6,000, where it has been stuck since 2019. The maximum contribution allowed for a healthcare flexible spending account is expected to increase to $3,050 in 2023, up from $2,850 this year. The maximum contribution amount for a 401(k) or similar workplace retirement plan is governed by yet another formula, using inflation data through September. Actuaries at Milliman, a benefits firm, estimate that the contribution limit will rise from $20,500 this year to $22,500 in 2023, and the catch-up amount for workers aged 50-plus will rise from $6,500 to at least $7,500.The child tax credit is even more complicated. Under current law, the total tax credit of $2,000 per child isn't adjusted for inflation, Mr. Pomerleau said. But the additional child tax credit that is refundable and available even to taxpayers who have no tax liability, is adjusted for inflation. It is expected to rise from $1,500 to $1,600 in 2023. The income limits related to the CTC aren't adjusted for inflation.Write to Ashlea Ebeling at ashlea.ebeling@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 14, 2022 12:58 ET (16:58 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270766Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:32:46.473775Z", "inner_id": 462, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5831, "annotations": [{"id": 6314, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "GFeDHQYMkT", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:33:47.211562Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:33:47.211598Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 59.982, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "d1d8e73b-cfa7-4b9d-8eef-bf0e8bd581fe", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5831, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "European Midday Briefing: Record Eurozone CPI -2-\n\n  The Bank of England is likely to make a \"significant\" change to its key interest rate in response to tax cuts recently outlined by the U.K. government when policymakers next meet in early November, its chief economist will say later Thursday. \n\n  \"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the fiscal easing announced last week will prompt a significant and necessary monetary policy response in November,\" Huw Pill will say, according to the text of a speech to be delivered later in Northern Ireland. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Pension Strategy Left Funds Vulnerable to Rate Increases \n\n  A pension-fund strategy that aims to reduce volatility without lowering returns created the first crack in the financial system after one of the fastest jumps in interest rates in decades. \n\n  The Bank of England stopped the selloff exacerbated by heavy selling from U.K. pension funds forced to raise cash. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.K. Prime Minister Defends Tax Cuts as Market Turmoil Continues \n\n  LONDON-Prime Minister Liz Truss looked to reassure the British public and rattled investors that her plan to cut taxes wouldn't lead to prolonged financial instability, arguing in a series of interviews on Thursday that the country had been buffeted by global shocks rather than her government's reforms and that her policies would result in faster growth. \n\n  \"We had to take decisive action,\" Ms. Truss told the British Broadcasting Corp. in her first public comments since the tax plan was presented last Friday.

The Fed \"has over the last few months reinforced just how much focus it has on short-term inflation,\" Mr. Roe said. \n\n     The surge in Treasury yields was echoed in foreign-government bonds as other major central banks step up their own efforts to control rising prices. \n\n     Sweden's Riksbank on Tuesday raised its benchmark rate by a full percentage point and signaled that it would end asset purchases by the end of the year to remove another leg of monetary stimulus. The Bank of England is expected to raise rates Thursday, following a similar move by the European Central Bank in early September. \n\n     \"What we're seeing from global central banks is a recognition that inflation is a more difficult issue for them to tackle than they may have thought a month ago or a year ago,\" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup. \n\n     Overseas stocks were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.1%, but in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.4% higher and the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2%. \n\n     Oil prices edged down, with Brent-crude futures trading falling 2% to trade at $90.15 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency's value against a basket of foreign money, ticked higher to 110.01, adding to the greenback's significant year-to-date gains. \n\n     Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 20, 2022 12:34 ET (16:34 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.270835Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:38:54.242808Z", "inner_id": 464, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5833, "annotations": [{"id": 6316, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "O1ik0rHeBM", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:39:54.191777Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:39:54.191803Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 59.136, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "03038d90-192b-470e-a4d8-46ae6e5b33c9", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5833, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Top News Today: Stocks Gain Ahead of Inflation Data on Hopes for Peak\n\n  MARKET WRAPS \n\n  STOCKS: U.S. stocks rose ahead of key inflation data that is expected to show further cooling of consumer prices. \n\n  TREASURYS: U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly, and the yield on the two-year Treasury closed at a 15-year high, ahead of inflation data that's set to influence the Federal Reserve's policy. \n\n  FOREX: The dollar continued a retreat against rivals as forex traders bet inflation would continue to cool. \n\n  COMMODITIES: Oil futures rose for a third straight session as the U.S. dollar continued to pull back from multidecade highs, and negotiations over an Iran nuclear deal hit another snag. \n\n  HEADLINES \n\n  Goldman Sachs Plans to Cut Hundreds of Jobs \n\n  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is preparing to lay off hundreds of staffers as soon as next week. \n\n  The job cuts are part of the bank's annual performance reviews that had been suspended during the pandemic, according to a person familiar with the matter. Goldman reinstated those reviews earlier this year following a slump in Wall Street deal-making activity. Goldman had 47,000 employees on staff at the end of June, up from 41,000 a year earlier. \n\n  The New York Times earlier reported on the impending layoffs. \n\n  Freight Railroads Propose Limiting Sensitive Cargo as Strike Threat Looms \n\n  Freight railroads said they are planning to halt the transport of hazardous materials and sensitive cargoes, such as chemicals used in fertilizer and chlorine for water purification, as they continue negotiations with two labor unions. \n\n  Railroads have informed customers that they may stop accepting certain types of freight, including bulk shipments, beginning Monday to avoid materials being unattended or unsecured in case of a work stoppage. \n\n  The railroads have already reached new labor deals or are completing tentative agreements with 10 unions, and are in continuing talks with two groups representing about 66,000 workers. The two remaining unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and SMART-Transportation Division, said Sunday that the railroads' plans to restrict cargo is a move to \"extort a contract settlement\" and that they remain at the bargaining table. \n\n  Twitter Says Elon Musk's Latest Argument to Nix Deal Is Invalid \n\n  Twitter Inc. said Elon Musk's latest argument to terminate his $44 billion agreement to purchase the social-media company is invalid, and it continues to seek to enforce the deal. \n\n  A lawyer for Mr. Musk on Friday argued that Twitter's roughly $7 million payment to a whistleblower gives the billionaire another avenue to walk away from the deal. \n\n  In a letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Twitter's legal team said that the latest reason for termination is \"invalid and wrongful\" and that it hasn't breached any of its representations or obligations under the merger agreement. The lawyers said that following approval from shareholders on Tuesday, all of the conditions to close the deal will be satisfied, aside from those that occur at the closing. \n\n  New Cancer Drug Beats Chemotherapy in Study \n\n  New data from the first of a new type of cancer drug suggest its benefits and limitations, while leaving room for other candidates seeking to enter the lucrative market. \n\n  Amgen Inc.'s lung-cancer pill Lumakras beat out a common chemotherapy in a late-stage study, helping patients survive without their tumors getting worse, though it failed to prove that it reduced overall deaths, the company said. \n\n  Lumakras is the first approved drug in an emerging class of treatments that target a genetic mutation called KRAS that is among the most common found in cancers. Researchers struggled for years to design drugs capable of attacking the mutation, which earned a reputation as \"undruggable.\" \n\n  Wells Fargo to Pay $145 Million to Settle 401(k) Plan Probe \n\n  Wells Fargo & Co. agreed to pay about $145 million to resolve U.S. Labor Department allegations that the bank's retirement plan overpaid for its own stock. \n\n  The Labor Department found that the bank's 401(k) plan and its trustee paid between $1,033 and $1,090 per share for preferred stock, which later converted to $1,000 in common stock when it was allocated to plan participants, the government agency said Monday. \n\n  Wells Fargo and GreatBanc Trust Co., the trustee, also used the dividends paid on the preferred shares to repay stock-purchase loans, thereby offsetting their own obligations to contribute to the 401(k) plan, the Labor Department said. \n\n  GE Chief Says Supply Chain Is a Daily Challenge \n\n  General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said that the company's breakup plans are on track but that it continues to battle supply-chain pressures that threaten to slow deliveries and push up costs. \n\n  Early Monday, GE named the board for its healthcare business and said it plans to spin it off as a separate company in the first week of January. Mr. Culp will be nonexecutive chairman of the new board, and GE Healthcare CEO Peter Arduini will also be a director. The Boston conglomerate plans to split into three separate public companies over the next two years while it navigates the pandemic's impact on its aviation business and supply-chain problems. \n\n  \"Supply chains, broadly defined, are still challenging,\" Mr. Culp said in an interview Monday, highlighting challenges at both the aerospace and healthcare divisions. \"You might have success here. You might make progress there, but I don't think we're anywhere close to declaring victory.\" \n\n  NY Fed Says Consumers Saw in August Steep Declines in Future Inflation \n\n  American consumers said in August that they are expecting notable declines in future levels of inflation, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Monday. \n\n  The bank said in its August Survey of Consumer Expectations that one year from now, households see inflation at 5.7%, down from the 6.2% they predicted in the July survey. Three years from now, survey respondents expect to see inflation at 2.8%, down from the 3.2% seen in July. \n\n  The expected level of inflation over the longer run also eased. The report said five years from now, survey respondents see inflation at 2% as of August, down from July's 2.3% forecast. In July, inflation was up by 6.3% from the same month a year ago, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index. \n\n  Instagram Stumbles in Push to Mimic TikTok, Internal Documents Show \n\n  Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is betting the social-media giant's near-term future on Instagram Reels, the short-video feature he is touting as the company's answer to TikTok. \n\n  The company's internal research shows that Meta has a lot of catching up to do. \n\n  Instagram users cumulatively are spending 17.6 million hours a day watching Reels, less than one-tenth of the 197.8 million hours TikTok users spend each day on that platform, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that summarizes internal Meta research. \n\n  California Offshore Wind Projects Face Hurdles as Pressure Groups, Industry Interests Weigh In \n\n  WASHINGTON-As the Biden administration plans for the country's first West Coast offshore wind turbines, interests ranging from commercial fishing fleets to powerful environmental groups are complicating the road ahead for the California projects. \n\n  The Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management expects to hold a lease sale for two offshore regions by the end of the year, one north of Santa Barbara near Morro Bay and another more remote site off Humboldt County just south of the Oregon border. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said the state \"is home to one of the world's best offshore wind resources in the world.\" \n\n  The floating turbines in both regions would likely be more than 20 miles offshore, making them hard to see from the coast and resolving the common complaint that turbines are an eyesore. Together, the projects are aimed at augmenting California's power supply, generating enough to run more than 1.5 million homes with more than 4.5 gigawatts of electricity, U.S. officials estimate. That input could help the state reach its goal of 100% zero-emission power sources by 2045. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  TALKING POINTS A Bad Year for Crypto Is a Really Bad One for Crypto Miners By Caitlin Ostroff and Vicky Ge Huang \n\n  Last year was harvest time for crypto miners. Now, they're getting hit on all sides. \n\n  Crypto prices are plunging. Miners' electricity bills are surging. Practically no one wants to buy their equipment. \n\n  It is a sharp turnaround from 2021, when crypto prices were soaring and many mining firms went on a mostly debt-funded buying spree of mining machines. But this year, crypto prices have been dropping and major crypto projects and companies have been wiped out. That has reduced the profits that miners can make from harvesting digital coins-and from selling their equipment in a pinch. \n\n  Meanwhile, prices for electricity-needed to keep the miners' powerful computers running-are soaring. Russia's war with Ukraine has hamstrung global energy supplies, while an extreme heat wave has bolstered energy demand from families that need to cool their homes. \n\n  Shares of crypto miners Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Blockchain Inc. and Core Scientific Inc. are all down 55% or more this year. \n\n  \"I don't think we are at the max pain yet in mining,\" said Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital. \n\n  Bitcoin miners set up and run the powerful computers that process bitcoin transactions. Those computers generate random numbers in hopes of finding the right combination to unlock formulas; the first to do so are rewarded with newly created bitcoins. \n\n  This makes it most profitable to mine bitcoin when the cryptocurrency's value is rising. Near bitcoin's 2021 peak, miners earned more than $60 million a day, according to data from Blockchain.com. Now, that number is around $19 million a day. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 12, 2022 16:34 ET (20:34 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273103Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:39:54.416126Z", "inner_id": 465, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5834, "annotations": [{"id": 6317, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "2MPx-ztCKG", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:40:35.152447Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:40:35.152473Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 39.989, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5c2ad9ce-5895-478d-97f3-7aa52e0e48c2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5834, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Japan Jumps Into Market to Buy Yen for First Time in 24 Years; Currency Rallies -- Update\n\n  By Megumi Fujikawa \n\n \n\n     TOKYO -- Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market by buying yen for the first time in 24 years, shortly after the Bank of Japan accelerated a fall in the currency by confirming it would maintain ultralow interest rates. \n\n     The rare intervention was the latest example of global concern triggered by the strong dollar, which has gained ground on the back of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases. \n\n     One nation hit by the fallout is Japan, the world's third-largest economy, which has to pay more for essential imports of oil, natural gas and food. These imports are generally denominated in dollars and now are costing more in yen terms. \n\n     The dollar rose near 146 yen after Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda hinted Thursday afternoon that interest rates in the country were likely to stay near zero for the next couple of years. \n\n     Less than an hour after Mr. Kuroda stopped talking, the government stepped in. It said it intervened in the market to sell dollars and buy yen -- the first such operation since 1998. \n\n     The move resulted in an initial success. Within minutes, the yen rose so that it took only around 141 yen to buy a dollar. Still, that is far below a level set earlier this year when the dollar was trading at around 115 yen. As of Thursday evening Tokyo time, the yen was trading at around 142.65 yen to the dollar. \n\n     The core cause of the dollar's strength, particularly against the yen, is the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and Japan, traders have said. \n\n     On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point and signaled additional large increases to come. A half-day later in Japan on Thursday, the central bank decided to maintain short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and its target for the 10-year Japanese government bond yield at around zero. \n\n     Mr. Kuroda said the bank had no plan to raise interest rates and repeated the bank's guidance that it would maintain easy monetary policy for the time being, which he defined as two to three years. The reason, he said, was that he didn't see Japan's inflation -- which hit 3% in August -- as likely to last. \n\n     \"It is almost certain that the pace of price increases will fall below 2% next fiscal year and beyond,\" Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference on Thursday. The next fiscal year in Japan begins in April 2023. Inflation in Japan is much milder than in the U.S., where prices have been rising at a pace exceeding 8%. \n\n     Mr. Kuroda said the yen's recent fall is \"one-sided and affected by speculative trading\" but reiterated that the bank would continue monetary easing because he said the nation's economy was still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\n     In recent months, traders have generally brushed off statements by Japanese officials expressing concern about the yen's fall, assuming Tokyo wasn't ready to put its money where its mouth was. That could change now, analysts said. \n\n     \"Speculative traders may become more cautious over verbal intervention, thinking that any comments by the finance minister could mean something, \" said Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities strategist Naomi Muguruma. \n\n     \"But the effects could be temporary as long as fundamental factors behind a weak yen remain, such as Japan's trade deficit and an interest-rate gap between Japan and abroad,\" Ms. Muguruma said. \n\n     --Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 22, 2022 06:05 ET (10:05 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273152Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:40:35.380864Z", "inner_id": 466, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5835, "annotations": [{"id": 6318, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "4xrGsuvuKV", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:41:58.641877Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:41:58.641902Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 82.438, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "c1c56965-6806-44a9-b661-1a3984e82f50", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5835, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Capital Journal Special Edition: How Economic Concerns Are Shaping the Midterm Elections\n\n  Welcome to a special edition of WSJ's politics newsletter looking at the impact of recent economic developments on the November midterm elections.

Sign up for What's News , free in your inbox on weekday evenings and Sunday afternoons.  Three Questions for WSJ's John McCormick \n\n  WSJ: What economic issues are voters watching most closely? \n\n  John McCormick: With most workers feeling relatively secure in their jobs because of the tight labor market, inflation has been the dominant economic issue for voters this entire year. It's something many younger voters have never dealt with before, or at least not at these levels that represent the highest inflation in four decades. Economists and pollsters say Americans feel it at a very personal level because rising prices are noticeable at almost every turn in their daily lives. For those on fixed incomes, like some seniors, it can be especially painful. And just a quick reminder on that slice of the electorate: those 65 and older typically vote at higher rates than everyone else. In the 2018 midterm election, 66.1% of seniors cast ballots, compared with a national average of 53.4% for the voting-age population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. \n\n  WSJ: You wrote about the political impact of inflation in March, finding that voters were losing patience then with rising prices. Have economic developments since then-with fuel prices easing but many consumer prices still elevated-likely shifted voters' views? \n\n  John McCormick: Asking voters how they're feeling about inflation was relatively new back then. We reported the story from the Phoenix area because it was recording the nation's biggest inflationary increases among the largest metropolitan areas, a dubious distinction it's continued to hold for much of 2022. Inflation hasn't gotten better in any significant way since then, although lower gasoline prices have helped ease some pain for those who drive a lot. I watch a lot of political ads-probably not the healthiest thing to do-and images of gas pumps and grocery-store aisles have dominated this year's Republican messaging. So, even if voters are feeling a little better because of lower pump prices, they're constantly being reminded about what feels like a hole in their pocketbooks. \n\n  WSJ: Are voters in some parts of the country more likely to make their decisions based on economic concerns than on social issues that have surfaced ahead of the election? \n\n  John McCormick: That's difficult to answer. The Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion and returned the issue to the states is certainly motivating some voters and Democrats have made abortion access an issue to try to counteract what polling shows is a perceived weakness on their handling of the economy. One thing we know is that inflation isn't the same everywhere. The national number -up 8.3% in August compared with a year ago-gets most of the attention. But food and fuel prices vary significantly across the nation and inflation will likely be a bigger issue in some congressional races than in others. In Nevada, host to one of the most competitive Senate races, gas prices are still averaging around $5.50 a gallon. In Pennsylvania, where there's another top Senate contest, they're below $4 a gallon on average. Few things are certain in politics, but I'd guess we'll see more ads featuring gas pumps in Nevada than Pennsylvania in the home stretch. \n\n  John McCormick is a national political reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Write to him at [mccormick.john@wsj.com]. \n\n  The Wall Street Journal is tracking the impact that inflation and rising interest rates are having on the economy ahead of the November elections. Here is a closer look at some of the issues. Voters have cited a range of issues likely to motivate them at the polls, including abortion, border security and gun violence, and in the weeks ahead we will examine some of those. \n\n   The jobs market continued its gradual cooling in September as high inflation and rising interest rates weighed on the economy. \n\n  U.S. employers added 263,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said Friday, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% from 3.7% in August, matching a half-century low that was last reached in July. The report keeps the Federal Reserve on track to approve another large interest-rate increase at its meeting next month as officials seek to lift borrowing costs high enough to soften the labor market and ease inflation pressures.  Fears of a recession aren't keeping employers burned during the pandemic from hoarding staff now. \n\n  Some large companies, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wayfair Inc. and Snap Inc., have recently announced or signaled layoffs, but they are outnumbered by companies saying that labor shortages are crimping sales and production, reports Sarah Chaney Cambon. \n\n   U.S. consumers are digging deeper into their wallets to cover rising costs of essentials. \n\n  Household spending rose 0.4% in August after dropping a revised 0.2% in July, according to the Commerce Department, but the August rise was just 0.1% after accounting for inflation, reports Harriet Torry. The Labor Department is set to release the September consumer-price report on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. \n\n   There are signs that inflation, already close to a four-decade high, has become increasingly entrenched. \n\n  Overall inflation slowed in August, measured by the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, but underlying price pressures strengthened during the month, reports Gwynn Guilford. Consumer prices rose 6.2% in August from a year earlier, easing from a revised 6.4% in July, as measured by the Commerce Department's personal-consumption expenditures price index. \n\n   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will stop at nothing to bring down inflation-even if his campaign prompts a recession. \n\n  During the pandemic's early days, Mr. Powell had followed the model that former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke set in the 2008 financial crisis, enacting policies to avoid market meltdowns. But with prices holding at elevated levels, Mr. Powell is using an aggressive playbook drawn up by former Fed chief Paul Volcker, reports Nick Timiraos. \n\n  A United Nations agency said last week that the Fed and other central banks risked pushing the global economy into recession followed by prolonged stagnation if they kept raising interest rates. Some economists fear the central banks might go too far if they don't take into account their collective impact on global demand. \n\n  About Us \n\n  This newsletter is written by the WSJ Washington bureau.

They became breakout stars of 2022 as inflation reached a four-decade high, markets plunged, and investors searched for a safe place to park their money. \n\n     As the deadline to get the 9.62% rate approached this week, the government's TreasuryDirect site, the only place investors can directly purchase I Bonds, became one of the most visited federal websites, officials said, and has experienced intermittent outages for several days this week. \n\n     Still, many investors continue to run into difficulties accessing and logging on to the site. \n\n     Todd Miller, who lives in Camarillo, Calif., hasn't been able to unlock his TreasuryDirect account. He has been trying for several days to get assistance, calling the site's help number and waiting over two hours. He was told Friday by a customer service representative that due to system outages, he wouldn't be able to get his account unlocked in time to snag the 9.62% I Bond rate. \n\n     \"I think the government should extend the deadline on this sale,\" said Mr. Miller. \n\n     \"We have tripled TreasuryDirect's capacity in the last day and continue to see customers successfully create accounts and purchase bonds at record levels. Any additional updates to TreasuryDirect during the final days of the rate window, such as a delay to the Nov. 1 rate change, would pose significant risk to the operational integrity of the system,\" said a Treasury spokesman. \n\n     \"Due to unprecedented requests for new accounts, we can't guarantee customers will be able to complete a purchase at the current 9.62% rate by the Oct. 28 deadline. The TreasuryDirect system has been and continues to process the payments that have been completed,\" a spokesman said. \n\n     If a customer receives a confirmation that their purchase has been made or completed by Oct. 28 11:59:59 p.m. ET, then the payment will be processed, a spokesman said. \n\n     Users regularly take to social media to complain about the TreasuryDirect website and sometimes go to great lengths to make their I Bond purchases. \n\n     \"The TreasuryDirect website isn't known for its user friendliness,\" said Elliot Pepper, a financial planner in Baltimore. \n\n     It isn't just people trying to buy I Bonds who are frustrated with the site's outages. \n\n     Investors can't buy or redeem T-Bonds, Treasury notes, or T-bills through TreasuryDirect if they can't access the site or log in due to the high demand. \n\n     Write to Veronica Dagher at Veronica.Dagher@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 28, 2022 15:48 ET (19:48 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273227Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:42:30.285317Z", "inner_id": 468, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5837, "annotations": [{"id": 6320, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "KfRHz3KGgd", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:42:55.141327Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:42:55.141352Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 24.137, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "5519dfaf-cf80-4bac-9a78-01abd1237f80", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5837, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Leaves Key Rate Unchanged at 13.75%\n\n \n\n  By Jeffrey T. Lewis \n\n \n\n  S\u00c3O PAULO--The Central Bank of Brazil left its benchmark lending rate unchanged, but warned again that it is prepared to resume hikes if the country's inflation doesn't keep slowing as expected. \n\n  The bank's monetary policy committee, known as the Copom, left its key Selic rate at 13.75% for the second consecutive meeting. The committee had raised the rate at 12 meetings in a row before the September conclave, lifting the Selic from a record low of 2%. The Copom said it is ready to raise rates again if the situation changes. \n\n  \"The committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected,\" the bank said. \n\n  Brazil's headline inflation rate has slowed in recent months, helped by tax cuts for fuels and certain other products and by lower oil prices. The 12-month rate fell to 7.17% in September, the lowest level since April of last year, after reaching an almost 19-year high of 12.13% in April 2022. \n\n  But underlying inflation is still a concern. Copom members are right to insist that they are ready to react if inflation heats up again, but with economic growth expected to slow and other central banks raising rates, the expectation is that consumer price increases will continue to moderate, said Pedro Paulo Silveira, chief economist at Nova Futura Investimentos. \n\n  \"Inflation should continue to fall, but it's still at a high level,\" he said. \"Pressure from oil prices, for example, has diminished and slower economic growth next year should help. But the scenario for next year suggests that the Selic will stay higher for longer until the remaining sources of pressure ease.\" \n\n  Brazil's economy should grow 2.76% this year, with the pace of expansion slowing to 0.63% next year, according to the central bank's weekly survey of economists. Some economic indicators are already showing weaker demand for credit-sensitive items, a sign that the central bank's string of rate increases is having the intended effect. \n\n \n\n  Write to Jeffrey T.

Any move by OPEC+ to raise oil prices could put further pressure on Western consumers already hurting from high energy costs while also helping Russia -- one of the biggest energy producers in the world -- fill its state coffers as it wages war against Ukraine. \n\n     Oil prices had shot up over $100 a barrel and stayed there for months but Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, is now down 23% this quarter, falling to $87.96 a barrel last week, and its swiftest decline since 2020. \n\n     Falling oil prices are often a pressure-release valve for the global economy, reducing costs as demand falls in a cycle that repeats itself. OPEC+ often holds itself out as a regulator of the oil market, aiming to keep supply and demand balanced, but a production cut would support prices at a time when they are at historically high levels. \n\n     Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions caused energy prices to soar, raising the price of gasoline in the U.S. and around the world. While prices have started coming down, a cut to production comes amid rising inflation, slowing growth and fears of recession. \n\n     Adel Hamaizia, a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, said the move could play a role in making recessions worse in some countries. He explained that the production cut could push inflation higher and hurt oil demand further. \n\n     The U.S. has asked OPEC+ to pump more oil to help bring down the price of gasoline. OPEC+ accelerated some production increases over the summer ahead of President Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia and made a small increase in August but has since worked to reverse those moves. \n\n     In the past months, the U.S. has responded to rising oil prices by tapping into its strategic stockpiles. Christyan Malek, global head of energy strategy at JP Morgan, said Saudi Arabia's support for a cut to production could partly be a response to the U.S. decision to release stockpiled oil, which has helped lower the price of gas for American consumers. \n\n     The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n     The production cut could also accelerate the world's changing flows of oil sales since the Ukraine invasion. China, which is seeing slowing economic growth, is turning to Russia for cheaper oil. At the same time, Europe is being forced to buy more expensive oil from Middle Eastern countries since it stopped buying oil from Russia over the Ukraine invasion. \n\n     Oil prices have been falling in part due to slowing growth in China, which has been hit by persistent Covid-prevention measures. The World Bank has said it expects China's economy to expand 2.8% in 2022, down from a 4.3% forecast in June. \n\n     Because the ultimate decision about a production cut will be hotly debated, the group decided to meet in person in Vienna on Wednesday for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, the delegates said. Other options being considered include a smaller reduction of 500,000 barrels a day or as much as 1.5 million barrels a day, the delegates said. \n\n     Russia and Saudi energy ministries didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\n     The option to cut more than 1 million barrels a day is backed by Russia, the group's biggest non-OPEC partner. \n\n     A costly war, lower energy prices and a new round of Western sanctions threaten to bear down on Russia's already embattled economy. The country is trying to maximize its windfall from soaring energy prices -- Russia's main economic strength -- after the government's budget reported a deficit due to diminished energy revenue. \n\n     \"Cuts and higher prices would certainly be at least a short term win for Russia as we approach winter,\" said Mr. Hamaizia. \n\n     But the cartel's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, has some reservations on the size of the cut, the delegates said. \n\n     OPEC+ agreed last month to cut oil production for the first time in over a year, saying it would cut about 100,000 barrels a day amid fears of a global recession. \n\n     The move ended an 18-month era of production increases for OPEC+. The group slowly brought crude back onto the market after a dramatic cut during the pandemic when demand plunged. \n\n     The Saudis have pursued a more aggressive oil policy this year as oil prices rose during the Ukraine war. Higher oil prices have helped Saudi Arabia become one of the world's fastest-growing economies this year and infused with cash an ambitious economic overhaul launched by the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \n\n     In one way, an OPEC+ cut won't make much meaningful difference in the day-to-day oil market. The group has been undershooting its targets by more than 3 million barrels a day for much of the year, with Russian production falling and big producers like Nigeria and Angola struggling to invest enough to raise output. \n\n     Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  Corrections & Amplifications\n\n  This story was corrected on October 2, 2022.

An effective debt-resolution mechanism is desperately needed,\" Ms. Georgieva said. \n\n     Her call to action comes as governments worldwide are reckoning with debt loads not seen in nearly 20 years, a burden that is draining resources when they are needed most. \n\n     To help support governments, the IMF has launched a one-year program to extend credit to countries struggling to afford high food and energy costs. Fund officials and global policy makers have also suggested that richer countries could reallocate billions of dollars in emergency reserves they received from the IMF during the Covid-19 pandemic to countries facing a budget crunch. \n\n     However, the IMF urged creditors to do more to help overindebted countries avoid choosing between paying their debts and paying for food. \n\n     \"Financing resources are scarce, but it is in the nature of trade-offs that policy makers face that food security and nutrition have to be given priority,\" said Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, adding that struggling countries \"need to have an orderly debt-restructuring mechanism and forms of debt relief to help put their public finances on a more sustainable path.\" \n\n     One such mechanism for sovereign debt relief, the G-20 Common Framework, has faced a number of criticisms for its shortfalls since launching in 2020. \n\n     The framework was designed as a one-size-fits-all approach for poorer countries to receive debt relief, and it was meant to improve cooperation among large creditors, including China, which has become the largest lender to the developing world over the past decade. \n\n     But the framework has produced mixed results for countries that have applied to their creditors for debt relief. Delays by the creditors to reach agreements have held up bailout funds and so far, no country has completed a debt restructuring under the framework. \n\n     \"We don't yet see other countries knocking on the door of the common framework,\" Ms. Georgieva said in a Wednesday meeting. \"The process is not very predictable.\" \n\n     Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday the G-20's common framework has so far been \"very disappointing,\" blaming China for not fully participating in the effort. \n\n     \"We've really called on China to step up. The situation is becoming very serious,\" she said. \n\n     Countries that aren't eligible for common framework debt restructurings are also seeking swift relief from creditors, despite their steadily worsening economic crises. \n\n     Sri Lanka, which this year became the first government in the Asia-Pacific region to default on its foreign debts since 1999, has struggled to organize its creditors and receive necessary assurances on debt relief that would unlock the IMF's planned $3 billion bailout. \n\n     China, Sri Lanka's largest creditor, didn't support the country's move to seek an IMF bailout and hasn't agreed to chair a committee that would help coordinate a renegotiation of its debts, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\n     Overall, the IMF warned that the path out of the global debt overhang won't be easy, as governments tighten their belts when they need to spend more to provide for citizens' basic needs. \n\n     After decades of reduction, \"extreme poverty has increased in the world, and it is projected to stay well above the pre-pandemic expected path going forward,\" Mr. Gaspar said. \"Emergency support is necessary.\" \n\n     --Yuka Hayashi and Andrew Duehren contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (October 15, 2022). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 15, 2022 02:33 ET (06:33 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273329Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:45:51.998458Z", "inner_id": 471, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5840, "annotations": [{"id": 6323, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "HhuYgXMMLD", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:46:10.909651Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:46:10.909676Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 18.173, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "1b353408-58a8-4d4b-a2c0-f583703df065", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5840, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Global Forex and Fixed Income Roundup: Market Talk\n\n   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income.

Oxford expects Ethiopia's inflation rate, already at multi-year highs to slow to 31.2% on year in the final quarter of 2022 from 32.1% on year in the third quarter, amid improved food supplies. \"Authorities are seeking to combat food price inflation through initiatives aimed at increasing food supply, such as wheat irrigation schemes and the improvement of agricultural productivity,\" Oxford says in a note. \"Headline inflation is projected to ease from 33.2% in 2022 to 28.7% in 2023 as strong annual base effects suppress m-o-m figures.\" (nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com; @Nicholasbariyo) \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 22, 2022 04:47 ET (09:47 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273367Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:46:11.134877Z", "inner_id": 472, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5841, "annotations": [{"id": 6324, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "rA8_DvC7sX", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:46:39.813220Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:46:39.813250Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 27.966, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "3ac021a7-a8aa-4c12-8e2d-a94b1590bbb2", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5841, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Voters Approve Tens of Billions of Dollars in Muni Projects -- WSJ\n\n  By Heather Gillers \n\n \n\n     U.S. voters said yes to tens of billions of dollars for road-paving, school-building and other local projects last Tuesday, promising a new wave of bonds for eager investors. \n\n     The voters approved $57 billion out of the $63 billion in ballot measures for which results are available, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. If that 90% approval rate holds steady, the total amount of new municipal debt authorized Tuesday will come to about $90 billion, the most from any election day in the data, which goes back to 2012. \n\n     State and local governments have pulled back on borrowing this year, issuing $257 billion in tax-exempt debt through October, down 7.5% from the same period last year. Higher interest rates and inflation are driving up construction costs, leaving some public officials wary of new projects. Others still have pandemic aid and elevated tax revenue from last year's stimulus-fueled economy to draw on. \n\n     That means the roughly $4 trillion market has fewer new bonds for investors to buy with the cash they get as old ones come due. About a fifth of outstanding muni debt matures every three years, according to research firm Municipal Market Analytics. \n\n     \"Managers need to take that money and plow it back into tax-exempt bonds, \" said Municipal Market Analytics partner Matt Fabian. \"That can be a challenge when rates are rising and product is scarce.\" The additional bond issuance is unlikely to affect prices much, he said, because demand will still far outpace supply. \n\n     Many towns and school districts must seek voter approval to issue bonds for local projects because residents' taxes could rise in order to pay back the debt. \n\n     Much of the money will be spent in the nation's fast-growing South and West, with $35 billion in Texas alone, by far the most of any state. \n\n     Voters in the Austin school district approved issuing more than $2 billion in bonds, the largest school-bond package ever approved in central Texas, according to the district. The money will pay for roof repairs and plumbing fixes, help upgrade security and athletic facilities, and replace school buses without air conditioning, among other improvements. \n\n     Voters in Mesa, Ariz., approved borrowing $157 million to renovate the city's police headquarters and build two new fire stations, among other public safety projects. Mayor John Giles said the additions would help Mesa \"respond to the needs of our fast-growing city.\" \n\n     Baltimore got permission to borrow $160 million for schools, infrastructure, economic development and affordable housing projects, according to the S&P data. And early results in New York state show voters there likely approved a $4.2 billion bond issue for water infrastructure and environmental and climate-change mitigation projects. \n\n     In the Clover, S.C., school district, 30 miles southwest of Charlotte, N.C., voters narrowly approved a referendum to borrow $156 million to build a second high school. A $197 million proposal that also included an elementary school failed 70% to 30% last year, according to Bryan Dillon, the district's public information officer. \n\n     \"Listening tours, public forums, reports back, going to people in school buildings, going to churches -- we did a lot,\" Mr. Dillon said. \n\n     To accommodate new students in the fast-growing Charlotte metro area, the 9,100-student district has converted one of its middle schools to a ninth-grade campus and created temporary classrooms for middle-schoolers in faculty work areas and mobile units. \n\n     Officials expect the new high school to be complete in time for the 2026-27 school year. \n\n     Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 13, 2022 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273399Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:46:40.043441Z", "inner_id": 473, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5842, "annotations": [{"id": 6325, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "PYWDsPu731", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:47:09.036559Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:47:09.036594Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 28.225, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "02b00b44-59a0-434b-8581-dc416b81abed", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5842, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Bakkafrost: Operational EBIT of DKK 325 Million for the Third Quarter of 2022\n\n(Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year unless \notherwise specified) \n \nThe Bakkafrost Group delivered a total operating EBIT of DKK 325 million \n(DKK 71 million) in Q3 2022 and made a profit of DKK 249 million (DKK \n131 million).

We are also pleased with the positive \nresults from the implemented changes in the large-smolt production \nregime in the Faroe Islands. This has resulted in more robust smolt with \nbetter biological performance. Declining mortality levels in the farming \noperation from the smolt produced after the changes were implemented \ndemonstrate the impact of these changes for our farming operation in \ngeneral and large-smolt production in the Faroe Islands and Scotland. \n \nWe are not satisfied with the biological performance in the Scottish \nfarming segment, where mortality rates have been higher than expected in \nthis quarter. This reminds us, that we still face challenges while we \nawait larger and better quality smolt. In Q2 2023, we will reach an \nimportant milestone in Scotland as we expect to release the first batch \nof large smolt from our Applecross hatchery. In the meanwhile, good \nbiological risk mitigation is important and freshwater treatment \ncapacity plays an important role here. Unfortunately, our new wellboat \nfor Scotland was delayed, but was finally in operation in late \nSeptember. Hereby we have significantly upscaled our freshwater \ntreatment capacity which is now finally at a sufficient level. The new \n4,000m3 well-boat can treat for gill health issues as well as remove sea \nlice in one gentle treatment and the results so far are promising. \n \nRegarding the market, Q3 has been a quarter with large variations. The \ntight supply and high prices in the beginning of the quarter was \nreplaced by significantly higher volumes supplied to the market in the \nsecond half of the quarter and at lower prices, however still well above \nprevious years.

Without inventory movements, the supply \nincrease was 6.6%, according to the latest estimate from Kontali \nAnalyse. \n \n27% higher salmon prices \n \nSalmon spot prices were 27% higher in this quarter compared to Q3 2021. \nStrong demand for salmon, moderate supply increase and general inflation \nhave contributed to high salmon prices in this quarter. \n \nNo growth in 2022 \n \nIn Q4 2022, the global supply growth is expected to be around 1%. For \nthe full year of 2022, the supply is expected to be on the same level as \nin 2021, including inventory movements. In H1 2023, zero growth is \nexpected. \n \nBakkafrost has a strong focus on ensuring a well-balanced flow to the \ndifferent markets to increase diversification and mitigate market risk. \nBakkafrost operates in the main salmon markets, Eu\u00acrope, the USA, and \nthe Far East. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Bakkafrost has \nstopped all trading with Russia. \n \nFarming \n \nThe strong biological performance in the Faroese farming operation seen \nin previous quarters has continued also in this quarter. Sea lice levels \nhave been maintained at all-time low levels for this quarter and the low \nmortality rates have also continued in this quarter. \n \nThe delivery of Bakkafrost's new Life Fish Carrier, Bakkafossur, has \nbeen delayed until Q4 2022. With its 7,000m3 tank capacity for seawater, \n3,000m3 for freshwater and a reverse osmosis system onboard for \nfreshwater generation, Bakkafossur will strengthen Bakkafrost's \ncapabilities to maintain low biological risk in the Faroe Islands. \n \nThe expansions of the hatcheries at Nor\u00f0toftir and Glyvradal are \nprogressing well and will start operations in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 \nrespectively. Combined, these capacity expansions will increase the \nsmolt production capacity in the Faroe Islands with around 6.5 million \nsmolts of 500g and are important milestones to fulfil Bakkafrost's goal \nto build an annual smolt production capacity in the Faroe Islands of \nover 23 million smolts of 500g in 2026. \n \nIn Scotland, farming conditions in Q3 2022 have followed the normal \nseasonal pattern with significant biological challenges and higher \nmortality. Especially the Loch Fyne and East Lewis & Harris areas have \nbeen affected and suffered increased mortality. The negative development \nin the quarter was a continuation of the increased mortality in late Q2 \n2022, which in particular affected farming sites with fish previously \ncompromised in H2 2021. The mortality levels in Q3 2022 have been higher \nthan expected and caused by different reasons, such as gill-related \nissues. \n \nIn late September 2022, the new 4,000m3 Life Fish Carrier with \nfreshwater treatment capacity, as well as an innovative in-line \nfreshwater-based sea lice removal system was introduced in the farming \noperation in Scotland. This vessel can efficiently do dual treatments \nfor gill-related issues as well as sea lice removal in one operation, \nthereby improving fish welfare while applying minimum stress on the \nfish. The results have been successful and together with the second Life \nFish Carrier in operation, Bakkafrost has secured proficient treatment \nvessel capacity in Scotland. \n \nThe biological risk in Scotland is still higher than in the Faroe \nIslands but is expected to be transformed with the implementation of \nBakkafrost's large-smolt strategy. As demonstrated in the Faroe Islands, \nlarge high-quality and robust smolt will have a lower risk exposure in \nthe marine environment due to shorter production cycles in the sea. This \nis expected to significantly reduce the biological risk in Scotland and \nis the cornerstone of the turnaround of the farming operation in \nScotland. Therefore, it is Bakkafrost's topmost priority in Scotland to \nbuild new modern hatcheries. The ongoing expansion of the Applecross \nhatchery is progressing well and will reach an important milestone by \nthe end of this year when the Applecross 4 expansion is expected to be \ncompleted. The first batch of large smolt delivered from Applecross 4 is \nplanned for Q2 2023 and will contribute to increasing the mean weights \nand quality of the smolt stocked in Scotland in 2023. \n \nThe full capacity of the Applecross hatchery, including the next \nexpansions, will be in operation in mid-2024 bringing the overall annual \nproduction capacity from Applecross to around 10 million high \n-qualitysmolts of around 500g. \n \nIn Q3 2022, the average weight of released smolt in Scotland was 107g, \nwhich is 9% higher than in Q3 2021. \n \nBakkafrost plans to build 3 large hatcheries in Scotland, which will \nincrease the total annual production capacity up to around 18 million \nsmolts of around 500g in 2026. \n \nSmolt release \n \nBakkafrost expects to release around 14.5 million large smolts in 2022 \nin the Faroe Islands and around 10.8 million smolts of around 110g in \nScotland. The number and the average weight of smolts released are key \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 08, 2022 00:37 ET (05:37 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273442Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:47:09.259517Z", "inner_id": 474, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5843, "annotations": [{"id": 6326, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "gpezWoS7JG", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:47:34.211673Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:47:34.211699Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 24.206, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "09799f45-3e02-49c7-a1cf-f3822ac5f8fd", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5843, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Electric Vehicles Require Lots of Scarce Parts. Is the Supply Chain Up to It? -- Journal Report\n\n  By Bart Ziegler \n\n \n\n     The car industry is staging a revolution -- a transition from the gasoline and diesel engines that have powered vehicles for over 130 years to a battery-propelled future. \n\n     But a key part of the reinvention remains unfinished and filled with risk: the supply chains for the parts needed to assemble fully electric vehicles. \n\n     The guts of EVs -- high-capacity batteries, electric motors and the sophisticated electronics that mesh them together -- are nothing like the engine blocks, transmissions and drive shafts that move internal-combustion cars and trucks. \n\n     \"This industry is going through a transformation like it hasn't seen since World War II,\" says Akshay Singh, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers's automotive practice. \"The whole supply structure is going to change.\" \n\n     On the upside, EVs require vastly fewer parts: An electric-car motor typically has only about 20 moving parts, compared with 200 or more in an internal combustion engine, according to Assembly magazine. \n\n     Yet the industry is young, and finding reliable sources for EV parts is daunting. Vehicle makers are deciding which parts to make on their own, sometimes through joint ventures, and which to source from their traditional component makers -- which themselves are undergoing radical restructurings to support the new electric world. \n\n     \"You can't take anything that you learned through [internal-combustion engines] and apply it to the EV supply chain,\" says Arun Kumar, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners. \n\n     Some pinch points: The batteries and most of the EV motors rely on unusual metals that can be costly and hard to obtain. The vehicles' electronics require new chips from a semiconductor industry still working through pandemic-era backlogs. Even the long aluminum trays that hold batteries beneath the floors of electric vehicles could end up scarce, Mr. Singh says. \n\n     Here's a look at the status of EV components -- and the supply chains that feed them -- as the industry gears up to make tens of millions of electric vehicles a year around the world. \n\n     Batteries \n\n     The good news: The cost of the lithium-ion batteries used in most EVs has fallen by more than half over the past five years. That lets EV makers pack in more batteries to allow a vehicle to go farther on a charge, as well as introduce lower-priced models. \n\n     But demand is surging, and battery makers face a number of hurdles. For one, the complexity and global logistics of the battery-making process -- from procuring raw materials, to refining them, to making the battery cells, to assembling battery packs -- could lead to bottlenecks. \n\n     \"There are supply chains within supply chains,\" says Edgar Faler, a senior industry analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. \"There are a lot of things that have to go right.\" \n\n     One of the biggest potential problems is finding sufficient and affordable supplies of key raw materials, including lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt. Much of the mining and processing of these metals is based in just a few countries. Two-thirds of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where some workers face dangerous conditions that have prompted protests from human-rights groups. Australia mines about half the lithium, while nickel is centered in Indonesia. \n\n     The refining of these materials for use in batteries is even more concentrated: China processes some 70% of the world's lithium and cobalt, and 99% of the manganese, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. China also dominates the market for the parts that go into batteries, such as cathodes and anodes, as well as the production of batteries themselves. \n\n     \"The issue is going to be around supply-chain risk,\" says AlixPartners' Mr. Kumar. \"Countries like China could decide they don't want to offer the latest and greatest highly purified nickel. That could put the U.S. industry at a disadvantage.\" \n\n     Battery makers, in fact, have been using more nickel, which can boost a battery's energy density, as they seek to expand the driving range of EVs. Some analysts project that the high-grade nickel that batteries require could be in short supply as EV sales rise. \n\n     Already, prices for nickel and several other battery ingredients have been soaring. Battery-grade cobalt was up 53% from Jan. 1, 2020, through October 2022, nickel sulfate rose 56%, and lithium carbonate soared 979%, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The consulting firm says these increases mean battery prices could rise this year for the first time since at least the early 2000s. \n\n     Meanwhile, a few car makers are already predicting battery shortages. \"Put very simply, all the world's [battery] cell production combined represents well under 10% of what we will need in 10 years,\" RJ Scaringe, chief executive of EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc., said in April. He added that \"90% to 95% of the battery supply chain does not exist.\" \n\n     Others don't believe there will be a battery shortage anytime soon. The expansion of EV manufacturing \"will start to put some strains on the [battery supply] system,\" says Ram Chandrasekaran, principal analyst of transport and mobility at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. But \"we don't forecast a deficit in battery packs for the next 10 years.\" \n\n     Wood Mackenzie says car makers won't flood the market with EVs but instead pace their production to the availability of batteries and the minimum level of output needed to meet government greenhouse-gas mandates. \n\n     Mr. Chandrasekaran also says the recently passed federal Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits for producers of battery packs whose rechargeable cells are sourced domestically, \"will go a long way in stabilizing the United States battery supply over the next five to 10 years.\" \n\n     More car makers plan to build new U.S. battery plants, many of them in joint ventures with Asian battery makers. Among them, Tesla Inc. is working with Panasonic Holdings Corp., General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co. have separately joined with LG Energy Solution Ltd., Ford Motor Co. is working with SK Innovation, and Stellantis NV has joined with Samsung SDI Co. \n\n     But these new factories can have hiccups. GM last month dialed back its EV sales target, citing startup issues with a new battery plant in Ohio. GM had expected to sell 400,000 EVs from early 2022 through the end of next year but pushed out the time frame until mid-2024. \n\n     Car makers also are signing long-term supply contracts for access to battery raw materials. Moreover, the recycling of batteries from EVs as they are scrapped at the end of their life will provide another source of the minerals. AlixPartners' Mr. Kumar says 20% to 40% of EV raw-material demand could be met through recycling by 2030. \n\n     Meanwhile, some EV makers, including Tesla and those in China, are using a different battery chemistry, lithium iron phosphate, for certain vehicles. These batteries don't require nickel or cobalt and so are less costly than lithium-ion ones, though they can't store as much power, says Mr. Kumar. \n\n     Electric motors \n\n     The majority of motors used in today's EVs rely on permanent magnets, which produce a constant magnetic field that helps spin a motor's rotor and, in turn, power the wheels. \n\n     But these magnets require costly rare-earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium. As with battery ingredients, the dominant supplier is China, and producing the metals can cause pollution, which could raise issues for investors who shun companies linked to environmental damage. \n\n     EV makers have a recourse: alternating-current induction motors, which have no permanent magnets. Instead, they use coils of copper wire to create a magnetic field that drives the motor. \n\n     AC induction motors -- invented in the 19th century and widely used in household appliances and industrial applications -- are less expensive but also less efficient. That can reduce a vehicle's driving range unless battery storage is boosted. \n\n     Yet as battery capacity grows and many experts expect the cost of batteries to resume their decline, the industry will move away from motors that require rare-earth metals, Mr. Kumar predicts. Tesla has long used AC induction motors in some models and other car makers are now considering them. \n\n     On top of this, analysts expect more vehicle makers to outsource some of their motor needs -- which could expand industrywide capacity by increasing the number of sites making motors -- rather than making them in-house, as most currently do. Overall, analysts don't see the motor supply posing as big a hurdle as batteries. \n\n     Electronics \n\n     EVs are like rolling computers. Consulting firm P3 Group says they require more than twice as many semiconductor chips as internal-combustion vehicles -- some 1,300 versus 600. \n\n     Chips control everything from how EVs take electricity from their batteries to how that juice is applied to the motors to how the batteries are recharged. They convert the batteries' direct-current output to AC, which most motors need. And as with most vehicles, chips manage braking, climate control and safety features like air bags. \n\n     All that demands a robust supply chain, something made glaringly clear the past few years as car makers had to limit output due to a chip shortage. \n\n     Analysts don't foresee the EV industry facing chip shortfalls in the future. Mr. Kumar, for one, is optimistic that plans by several chip makers to build more U.S. plants, spurred in part by the $280 billion federal Chips and Science Act passed this year, will help boost supply to meet the EV ramp-up. \n\n     One wild card, he says, is how much vehicle makers continue to rely on Taiwan, the world's dominant semiconductor maker. Taiwan \"has its own geopolitical issues,\" Mr. Kumar says, referring to its fraught relationship with China, which claims the island nation as its own. \n\n     Mr. Ziegler is a former Wall Street Journal editor.

That&apos;s Good News for the Stock. -- Barrons.com\n\nTeresa Rivas \n\n     Consumers found plenty of good deals this Black Friday on everything from toys to T-shirts -- except Hoka sneakers. That might be bad news for runners, but good news for owner Decker Outdoors. \n\n     While shopping was the unofficial national pastime during the pandemic, when few other options were available, retailers have had a rougher 2022. With the world reopening, stores have to compete with experiences like travel and restaurants for Americans' entertainment budgets -- and those are smaller overall thanks to record inflation. \n\n     The upshot is stores began running holiday promotions in October, hoping to capture shoppers' discretionary dollars before they ran out entirely. That trend continued over the long holiday weekend: Shoppers turned out in force to take advantage of generous discounts. \n\n     However those steep sales often hurt retailers' margins, and in turn their bottom lines. Aggressive markdowns this summer in the face of overstocked inventory and falling demand led to a broad selloff in retail, as many companies slashed their profit outlooks. \n\n     That's what makes Deckers' (ticker: DECK) lack of discounting stand out, particularly a time when nearly all of its peers were running sales that were as or more generous than last year. \n\n     Jefferies analysts Randal Konik and his team found that nearly three-quarters of the 54 retailers they follow offered steeper discounts than 2021, while the rest at least matched last year. Moreover, he writes that the \"activewear retailers -- Lululemon Athletica (LULU), Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA) -- stood out as being more promotional.\" \n\n     In fact, the Black Friday sales event was marked by a \"big escalation of promotional activity,\" writes Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic, so much so that the question remains whether or not this signals \"a race to the bottom between now and January.\" \n\n     Yet he calls Deckers the one \"shining star,\" from the last week. Given that Ugg tends to generate about half its annual revenue from the holiday season, it's encouraging to hear that everything appears to be falling into place. \n\n     It was one of the only brands Nikic tracks that was less promotional over the last week than they were in 2021 at both its full-line and outlet stores, and discounts were also low at partner stores such as Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's (M). Likewise online search activity remains robust, as does social media buzz around its high-demand styles. \n\n     That's a trend that Piper Sandler's Abbie Zvejnieks highlighted as well: \"Ugg promotions were limited on core classics, and we think momentum behind styles such as Platform, where Ugg may be unable to chase the current demand, is increasing demand for other classics.\" \n\n     She also notes that when it comes to the \"broadly higher promotions across both apparel and footwear,\" online, Hoka and fellow ultra-cushioned sneaker maker On Holdings' (ONON) On Running \"did not participate.\" \n\n     That tracks with what Barron's argued when we recommended Deckers stock in October. We noted that Uggs had become a more stable source of earnings at the same time that Hoka was making impressive inroads with both runners and fashionistas. The shares are up nearly 14% since. \n\n     If its two main brands do pull off another robust holiday season without resorting to the discounting that's plagued the sector, Deckers could add to those gains. Higher earnings would in turn make the stock's valuation, which isn't as compelling as it was when our article was published last month, more appealing. \n\n     For their parts, Nikic and Zvejnieks think the stock will be able to keep running. Nikic has an Outperform rating and $410 price target on the shares while Zvejnieks has a Buy rating and $440 price target. \n\n     NFJ Investment Group Chief Investment Officer John Mowrey, who owns Deckers and praised it in October, tells Barron's he still bullish on the stock, as he thinks it will benefit from structural tailwinds that will extend beyond the holiday season. \"The consistency of Deckers' earnings and margin profile are a major advantage relative to many other competitors.\" \n\n     We agree, and even if the stock -- much like its shoes -- is no longer on sale, it should still be on investors' radars. \n\n     Write to Teresa Rivas at teresa.rivas@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 28, 2022 15:42 ET (20:42 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273515Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:48:02.043144Z", "inner_id": 476, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5845, "annotations": [{"id": 6328, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "Ry5YlZVMEp", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:49:03.900196Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:49:03.900221Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 61.081, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "98c9b187-4759-4c0f-8aa0-9d852b1e8415", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5845, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Must Inflation Be Brought Down All the Way to 2%? -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ\n\n  By Jon Sindreu \n\n \n\n     \"Why must inflation be around 2%?\" is a question that obsessed central bankers back when inflation was stubbornly below their favorite target. It makes more sense to ask it now. \n\n     This past week, a string of data has suggested that inflation is finally on a downward trend. The U.S. personal-consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy -- the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation -- recorded its second-smallest monthly increase for the year, even as consumer spending jumped and job growth continued. Meanwhile, eurozone inflation receded to 10% in November, suggesting that October's 10.6% was the peak. \n\n     Stocks have rallied, especially after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that interest rates will go up in smaller increments from now on. But he also indicated that the tightening is far from over. Indeed, central bankers don't ultimately care if inflation stops rising: They want it to go down, back to the 2% number they are mandated to hit. \n\n     It underscores the misalignment between their interests and everybody else's, which should worry investors. \n\n     Inflation in many rich countries has been decelerating since July, yet economists don't expect it to return to 2% until a distant 2025, based on median forecasts. Derivatives markets price in that the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will stop raising rates in 2023, cut them later in the year, and then sit on their laurels for two full years as inflation grinds down. \n\n     But what if inflation stabilizes at a higher rate -- say between 4% and 6%? In this plausible case, central banks may be compelled to start needlessly raising rates again, catching investors off guard. It would make a lot more sense to raise the inflation target instead, or define it as a wider range. \n\n     Yes, out-of-control inflation involves large disruption, as uncertainty about costs gives businesses a reason to cut production, and workers with diminishing purchasing power resort to strikes. But such problems stem from inflation accelerating, not its being high. \n\n     Inflation of 4% is perfectly compatible with a healthy economy that isn't overheating. A possible reason would be the fragmentation of global supply chains, which research suggests previously suppressed price pressures. \n\n     Some on Wall Street fear pay wouldn't keep up and hit consumption, as the commodity shock is doing now. But, in the long term, economies tend to grow, which means \"real\" incomes do too. And historical data shows no evidence that higher inflation diverts less of this income to wages relative to profits, or vice versa. \n\n     To be sure, problems arise when inflation is very high or, by contrast, when there is deflation. This is why most economists advocate a small but positive rate of price growth. \n\n     There is no reason it must be 2%, however. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which pioneered inflation targeting in 1989, arbitrarily chose a 0%-to-2% range simply because then-Minister of Finance Roger Douglas thought it sounded low. It probably helped that the historical median CPI growth in countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. was roughly 2%. \n\n     There could be trouble if raising the inflation target in itself triggered wage pressures that fed back into prices. Back when inflation stayed below 2%, economists such as Olivier Blanchard, Larry Summers and Jordi Gal\u00ed insisted it was a problem in need of solving, and that a higher target could do it. This outcome is unlikely, though: Expectations of inflation are less important in price setting than whatever inflation has just done. \n\n     For the sake of workers, firms and investors, the time to rethink targets is neither when inflation is low nor when it is accelerating, but when it is high and stable. \n\n     Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 04, 2022 09:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273549Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:49:04.096824Z", "inner_id": 477, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5846, "annotations": [{"id": 6329, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "E115UcTUwi", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:49:51.208126Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:49:51.208143Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 46.416, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "7c62bfb5-2915-48ac-9604-453507c2f669", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5846, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Income Investing: Bonds Have Been Awful. Now Is the Time to Buy Them. -- Barron&apos;s\n\nBy Lawrence C. Strauss \n\n     Bond investors will be glad to see 2022 in the rearview mirror before long. \n\n     \"It has been a long and quite painful year for sure, given that most parts of the market are down 10-plus percent or so,\" says Anders Persson, chief investment officer for global fixed income at Nuveen. \n\n     An aggressive dose of short-term rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation has weighed heavily on bond prices. \n\n     The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index is down about 11% year to date, including interest payments. Exchange-traded funds that track high-yield securities, long-term Treasuries, and investment-grade credits all have notched double-digit losses as well. \n\n     But that wretched performance could lead to better results in 2023, partly because \"we're starting with yield levels now that are much more interesting and appealing to investors,\" says Persson. \n\n     The 10-year U.S. Treasury note, for example, yields about 3.5%, up from around 1.5% at the end of 2021. (Bond prices and yields move inversely.) \n\n     \"The world had accepted lower yields and that there wasn't really a lot of income in fixed income,\" says Kay Herr, head of fixed-income research at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"And we finally had a reset.\" \n\n     A silver lining heading into the new year is that there's a lot more income available from bonds than there was a year ago. \n\n     With rates moving up so dramatically this year, many investors have piled into the short end of the curve. The two-year Treasury yields around 4.2%, for example. \n\n     Still, \"you can move a little bit out the curve from cash and from Treasuries into investment-grade bonds and pick up incremental yield,\" says Ashish Shah, chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"You don't have to take a lot of risk.\" \n\n     The SPDR Portfolio Short Term Bond ETF (ticker: SPSB) recently had a yield to maturity of about 5%. \n\n     Steve Cianci, co-head of the global fixed-income team at MacKay Shields, says the yields on investment-grade bond strategies at his firm range from 5% to 7% -- a big contrast from what had been available until recently. Portfolio managers \"had to move well outside of public fixed income to private debt, to high yield, and to other, less-high-quality asset classes to get those kind of yields,\" he says. \n\n     Bond investors no doubt will be watching the Fed, in particular its rate policy. \"What the Fed is going to do, what's going to happen with inflation, and the likelihood of a recession -- that's what you really need to think about pricing in,\" says Herr. \n\n     A recession is considered likely, partly because of an inverted yield curve. But the magnitude of such an event remains uncertain, especially if the Fed can engineer a soft landing. \n\n     Matt Nest, global head of active fixed income at State Street Global Advisors, says his top investment idea for 2023 is long-term Treasuries. \n\n     The 10-year Treasury has rallied recently, a result Nest ascribes to the bond market anticipating a decline in inflation and economic growth. It was recently yielding 3.5%, down from around 4.25% in October. \n\n     Nest sees longer-term Treasuries as a good hedge against either a soft or hard economic landing. \"If you get a soft landing, inflation slows down, you don't go into recession, and everything turns out OK in fixed income,\" he says. But if there's a hard landing, he says, \"Treasuries do well and everything else does poorly.\" Treasuries would be considered a haven in those circumstances. \n\n     Persson says Nuveen has \"a little bit more of an up-in-quality tilt in our investing\" and that \"diversification is incredibly important.\" \n\n     Among his ideas are BBB corporate credits, which are at the low end of investment grade, and BB issues -- the upper range in terms of quality for high-yield bonds. \n\n     Municipal bonds have lost about 7% year to date, better than the broader bond market. Yields on high-quality munis are above 4%, about double their levels at the beginning of the year, according to John Miller, head of municipals at Nuveen. \n\n     He adds that this bond sector overall is well fortified to withstand an economic downturn, pointing to attractive valuations, strong credit quality, healthy government cash levels, and flat new bond supply. \n\n     Real estate investment trusts, a popular vehicle for income investors, have also struggled. The iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) has returned minus 20.5% this year. REITs, which are known for their attractive dividends, are seen as having some bondlike characteristics, making them vulnerable at times to rising rates and inflation. \n\n     \"REITs are now about fairly priced,\" says Cedrik Lachance, director of research at Green Street, which analyzes real estate. \"REITs haven't been close to that in a long time while rates were going up.\" He adds, \"As an entry point, today is an OK day.\" \n\n     One of the few bright spots for income investors this year has been dividend stocks. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes stalwarts such as Coca-Cola (KO) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), has returned minus 2.5% this year, well ahead of the minus 14% result for the S&P 500. \n\n     Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at BofA Securities, says that she expects S&P 500 earnings to shrink by about 10% in 2023. \n\n     \"That would normally be a risk for dividends,\" she says. \"But given how low the payout ratio is, there are very few sectors with dividends that look unsafe at this point.\" \n\n     The S&P 500's dividend ratio -- the percentage of earnings that gets paid out in dividends -- is around 30%, far below its long-term average of 50%, according to BofA Global Research. \n\n     \"If you're buying high-quality companies that can maintain their dividend because their earnings don't collapse in a recession, then you will do well,\" says Michael Liss, a portfolio manager at American Century Investments. One example he cites: oil-services company Baker Hughes (BKR), which yields 2.6%. \n\n     Write to Lawrence C.

It includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, widens a ban on TikTok on government devices, and extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. \n\n     The bill includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than President Biden had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. Senate negotiators said it also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion from the prior year. \n\n     Congress must pass the spending package through both chambers before the expiration of an interim funding bill that runs through Dec. 23. Because of the delays built into the Senate's process, quick enactment will depend on whether all 100 senators can agree to forgo debate time and proceed to a final vote. The Senate is expected to vote first, followed by the House, where leaders have told lawmakers to expect a vote late Wednesday at the earliest. \n\n     The bill will require support of at least 10 Republicans in the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation to advance. Many House Republicans have urged their Senate colleagues to reject the package and push talks into next year, when the GOP will control the House. But Republican senators have largely coalesced behind the plan. \n\n     The Biden administration said it supports the legislation. \n\n     \"Our bipartisan, bicameral, omnibus appropriations bill directly invests in providing relief from the burden of inflation on the American people, \" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D., Vt.). \"The choice is clear: We can either do our jobs and fund the government, or we can abandon our responsibilities without a real path forward.\" \n\n     Senate Republicans said that the increases in military spending represented GOP victories, claiming that the deal broke a yearslong bargain to ensure parity between increases in defense and nondefense spending. That is because the annual inflation rate was 7.1% in November, and while the defense-spending increase exceeded that level, the nondefense discretionary spending increase fell short of the inflation rate. \n\n     \"Since day one, I have insisted on increasing defense funding well above the president's request without similar increases in wasteful liberal nondefense spending,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"This process was far from perfect, but ultimately it allowed Republican redlines to be adhered to and because of that I will urge my colleagues to support this package.\" \n\n     The bill incorporates the Senate's version of the Electoral Count Reform Act, bipartisan legislation that overhauls an 1887 law governing how Congress counts and ratifies presidential elector votes. The bill was written in response to efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to try to overturn the 2020 election results. It would make clear that Congress's role in ratifying states' Electoral College votes is ministerial only, and that the vice president's role is limited to counting the votes publicly. \n\n     It would dramatically raise the threshold to sustain an objection to a state's electors from one House member and one senator to one-fifth of both chambers, and establish a fast-tracked judicial review of disputes related to states' elector certificates, including a three-judge panel with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. \n\n     Left out of the package were several initiatives pushed by lawmakers outside the spending negotiations. The bill didn't expand the child tax credit for low-income families, as some Democrats wanted, or reinstate the immediate deduction of research costs incurred by businesses, as some Republicans and companies sought. \n\n     A provision that would have offered green cards to evacuated Afghans in the U.S., known as the Afghan Adjustment Act, wasn't included. But lawmakers did include an extension of the special immigrant visa program for Afghans who worked alongside the American military through 2024. \n\n     The spending package kept annual funding for the Internal Revenue Service essentially flat. Republicans had sought cuts, complaining that Democrats already made the tax agency flush after approving $80 billion in the climate, healthcare and tax legislation that Mr. Biden signed in August. The less the IRS gets each year, the more that $80 billion will be used to backfill routine costs instead of IRS expansion. \n\n     Democrats highlighted the inclusion of $5 billion in mandatory funding for a toxic-exposures fund to cover healthcare for about two-dozen health conditions that the Department of Veterans Affairs now considers automatically related to military service, including diseases related to exposure to burn pits in combat zones. That was well above the $1.4 billion that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would be needed this year. \n\n     The bill also would ban the downloading of TikTok on government-issued smartphones and other devices, expanding to all government devices a ban currently imposed by the Pentagon and some other U.S. agencies. A separate bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent earlier this month but had not been brought up in the House. The legislation comes amid widening concerns over the Chinese-owned video app's security risks for the U.S. \n\n     One provision in the 4,155-page legislation gives Boeing more time to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. The Dec. 27 deadline had been set by Congress two years ago, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected. Without an extension, Boeing said in a securities filing that it might cancel both planes, exposing it to financial losses. Orders for the planes are valued at tens of billions of dollars in revenue. \n\n     House Republican leaders have urged their rank-and-file members to oppose the package arguing that negotiations should be pushed into next year, when GOP control of the chamber will give it more leverage. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is leading the opposition as he seeks to cajole members to support his bid to be elected House speaker next year. \n\n     But because a majority of Democrats can pass the bill without Republican support, much of the focus is on the Senate. Top Senate Republicans are calling for passage, saying that they limited nondefense spending on domestic programs through their negotiations. The main question is whether Senate Republicans opposed to the bill will exercise their power to slow down the voting beyond Dec. 23, the last day of government funding. \n\n     \"I object to a budget that nobody will see to the very end, thousands of pages long, created by a few people basically in secret,\" Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) told reporters on Monday night, referring to the closed-door negotiations over the spending bill. \"I see no value to this process.

Now, under a new prime minister, the government is pledging fiscal austerity, accompanied by an increase in the corporate tax rate to 25%. \n\n     With the latest change, the corporate tax rate has flip-flopped four times in less than a year. The tax increase, from the current rate of 19%, will apply to companies with annual profit of more than GBP250,000, equivalent to more than $307,000. The higher rate is set to raise around GBP18 billion in additional tax income a year, the government said in October. \n\n     A few months before the levy is set to take effect in April, finance executives say they welcome the certainty -- if not the higher taxes -- as they prepare their budgets for 2023. With a host of other hurdles on the horizon, from rising financing costs to a tight labor market, it is one less wild card. \n\n     \"What I really disliked was, at one point it was going down, then it was going back again, then it was going down and now it is going back up again,\" said Associated British Foods PLC Finance Director John Bason, referring to the corporate tax rate. \"We can plan ahead now. We know it is increasing to 25%.\" \n\n     The U.K. government's change brings the corporate tax rate in line with those of other large economies. Both China and France have the same rate, the U.S. is at 21% at the federal level while Germany's corporate levy effectively is at 30%, according to professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. \n\n     Associated British Foods, the owner of fast-fashion chain Primark and other businesses, will see its full-year tax bill increase by around GBP20 million from a total of roughly GBP300 million due to the tax change, Mr. Bason said. ABF, which reported a 22% increase in annual revenue to GBP17 billion and a 46% increase in operating profit to around GBP1.2 billion, said it would review its investment plans in the U.K. \"We certainly will look at our investments,\" Mr. Bason said. \"But at this point, it is not leading to a reappraisal of any of the investments that we're making.\" \n\n     For London-based financial technology company Wise PLC, clarity around the corporate tax is helpful as the company looks to expand its business, Chief Financial Officer Matt Briers said. \"All we ask for in the U.K. is that it is predictable and stable,\" Mr. Briers said. \n\n     Wise, which reported a 55% increase in revenue to GBP397 million and saw total income rise 63% to GBP416 million for the six months ended Sept. 30, is working to maintain its profit margin and run its business more efficiently, Mr. Briers said. \"The tax rate we certainly can't control. ... Those are the controllables,\" Mr. Briers said, referring to Wise's profit and its plans to save capital. \n\n     U.K. companies planning for 2023 are weighing factors such as access to labor -- which is more limited after the U.K.'s exit from the European Union -- inflation, financing costs and future tax obligations, said Sharon Bell, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \"Of course, clarity is a very useful thing,\" Ms. Bell said about the increase in the corporate tax rate. \n\n     U.K. companies' costs are rising on multiple fronts. Interest rates have gone up to 3% and are expected to rise further, which is driving up borrowing costs. That is after a decade during which many companies were able to renew financing terms at cheaper rates than those that they previously had as the Bank of England loosened monetary policy, Ms. Bell said. Borrowing costs for all businesses have risen, she said, with European companies looking to refinance now facing rates of around 4% to 5%, up from 1% to 2% a year or two ago. \n\n     Inflation rose to a 41-year high in October, running at 11.1% as prices for energy and other items have surged. The pound remains down more than 7% from a year earlier at around $1.23. \n\n     The outlook for companies is getting darker. U.K. companies issued 86 profit warnings in the third quarter, up from 51 a year earlier and 64 in the previous quarter, according to EY-Parthenon, the strategy arm of professional services firm Ernst & Young. More companies in the third quarter issued their third or more warning in a 12-month period, according to Jo Robinson, a turnaround and restructuring strategy leader at EY-Parthenon. \n\n     \"Businesses are facing an unprecedented combination of headwinds, including rising costs, slowing demand and excess supply, making it increasingly difficult to balance competing priorities,\" Ms. Robinson said, according to a release. \"Increasing uncertainty means that events could move quickly for companies that show signs of stress.\" \n\n     But compared with a few months ago, the economic outlook is more stable, said ABF's Mr. Bason. Interest rates are higher, but aren't rising as rapidly as before, and the U.S. dollar has lost some of its strength, he said. \n\n     \"Some of those moves, particularly interest rate moves and exchange rate moves, were so extreme,\" Mr. Bason said. \"We're in a better place.\" \n\n     Write to Jennifer Williams-Alvarez at jennifer.williams-alvarez@wsj.com and Nina Trentmann at nina.trentmann@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (December 5, 2022). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 05, 2022 02:32 ET (07:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273669Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:51:01.625310Z", "inner_id": 480, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5849, "annotations": [{"id": 6332, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-cause-dominant"]}, "id": "X4snq6ooIp", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:51:22.929726Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:51:22.929751Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 20.59, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "85623a0c-cfce-44bf-88ea-4e4fe38914f6", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5849, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "The Computers Driving the Oil Market Get Fresh Scrutiny -- WSJ\n\n  By Bob Henderson \n\n \n\n     It has been a tough year for oil traders. Even the computers haven't been able to get it right consistently. \n\n     Wall Street is closely tracking firms that use trend-following algorithms to trade oil futures, which profited mightily from betting on higher prices as crude climbed to more than $120 per barrel this spring. But with oil falling bumpily since June, the trend-followers have waffled between bullish and bearish wagers and given some of those profits back. \n\n     Analysts are blaming them for amplifying oil's wild price swings. Traders are monitoring them to steer clear of the waves they make in the market. Investors are mimicking them for profit. And this year's oil-price roller-coaster ride is putting their logic to the test. \n\n     Recent research from Goldman Sachs cited so-called commodity trading advisers for intensifying a recent five-week slide in which oil dropped nearly 23%. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, landed at a recent low around $79 a barrel, close to where it started the year. \n\n     Commodity trading adviser, or CTA, is industry jargon for a hedge fund that uses computer algorithms to divine and follow price trends, typically by comparing recent prices to their average over a previous period. Despite their name, CTAs trade futures on currencies, stocks, and bonds in addition to commodities such as oil. \n\n     Like previous ones, \"the most recent selloff, has also been associated with substantial CTA liquidations,\" says Daniel Ghali, senior commodities strategist at TD Securities. \n\n     While stocks and bonds have tumbled this year, CTAs have posted returns exceeding 18%. They have thrived by betting on gains in the U.S. dollar and in bond yields, which were propelled higher by the postpandemic recovery and the Fed's fight against inflation, and in commodity prices, which skyrocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\n     But commodities may be particularly apt targets for trend-following due to their susceptibility to boom-and-bust price cycles -- and because their long-term appreciation may be threatened by innovation, substitution and conservation. \n\n     TD Securities estimates that 30% of commodities futures trading flow is from CTAs. Mr. Ghali said that number \"dramatically understates\" their influence on price changes taking place over days or weeks since, he estimates, another 50% comes from high-frequency trading algorithms that enter and exit trades too quickly to affect prices over those time scales. \n\n     CTAs and other investors provide beneficial liquidity and balance to the oil market, since far more oil is sold via futures and other derivatives by oil producers looking to hedge their exposure than is bought by consumers such as airlines doing the opposite. Investors bridge the divide. \n\n     \"Oil has been a very strong, positive contributor,\" to CTA performance, since the advent of fracking for shale oil hit prices hard in 2014, says Chad Martinson, CIO of Efficient Capital Management, which allocates $2.5 billion of investor assets to 25 CTAs. The energy subsector is the biggest contributor to his fund's 24% returns this year. \n\n     Oil traders who live by their wits in lieu of algorithms nonetheless pay companies such as Bridgeton Research Group for intel on CTAs that could lessen the likelihood they will buy just before CTAs sell and lower prices, or vice versa. \n\n     \"We look ahead, almost like a radar,\" says Stephen Roseme, Bridgeton's co-founder. \"If you're driving an F1 car, you want to know that there's some water ahead on the road.\" \n\n     Bridgeton runs its own trend-following algorithm that imitates the CTAs. Their model estimates they sold about 85 million barrels worth of Brent futures during their recent five-week rout, and suggests that nearly 30% of those sales occurred the same day Brent took its biggest hit, of $3.33 on December 6. \n\n     \"When everybody is on the same side of the boat, it is a sizable position in the market,\" says Jerry Prior, COO and portfolio manager at Mount Lucas Management LP, a CTA that is up about 27% this year. \n\n     Prior's algorithm began buying crude in 2021, held a maximally long oil position going into the war in Ukraine, but didn't start selling until September, even though prices had been sinking since June. His fund is now short oil, consistent with Bridgeton's assessment of CTAs overall. \n\n     \"It's been a little interesting,\" on the way down, Mr. Prior says. But he also considers his algorithm's reluctance to cash out of winning trades more quickly a feature not a bug. \n\n     \"Human nature wants you to get out of that trade earlier,\" he said. Still, he added, it is the all-too-human propensity to cling to past gains that will \"eat your lunch\" by making you trade too much. \n\n     Algorithms \"don't care about headlines. They don't care about losing their year. They don't care about explaining to clients why they used to be long something and now they're short something,\" says Andrew Beer, managing member of Dynamic Beta Investments and co-portfolio manager of the iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy exchange-traded fund. \n\n     While some pros are surveilling CTA flows to trade around them, Beer's firm profits by piggybacking on them. Each day, it estimates the average positions of the 20 largest CTAs with a statistical model that compares their recent profits and losses to the price changes of 10 of the most highly traded futures contracts. The iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy ETF, which holds those estimated positions, is up about 20% this year. \n\n     But the fourth quarter hasn't been kind to the CTAs. The trends that powered their performance earlier this year have largely petered out resulting in a pullback in profits. Despite oil's outsize contribution to their bottom lines, Bridgeton's modeling suggests the CTAs have been losing on their oil trades since May, in part from holding on to bullish bets even as prices declined, and because severe volatility has tricked their algorithms into a few false starts. \n\n     \"We're now in a period of uncertainty,\" says Mr. Roseme. \"These funds are looking for direction, but not seeing it.\" \n\n     A closer look at Bridgeton's estimates of CTA selling during oil's recent five-week slide suggests that the bulk of their sales occurred in the days following drops, rather than at the same time. So, while traders are eyeing the algorithms, the algorithms are looking right back. \n\n     \"It's called trend-following,\" says Mount Lucas's Mr. Prior. \"The key word there is 'follow'.\" \n\n     Write to Bob Henderson at bob.henderson@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  Corrections & Amplifications\n\n  This item was corrected at 11:13 a.m. ET.

Rubin \n\n \n\n     Black workers, young workers and people on the bottom of the income scale were among those who saw the largest pay increases last year, when employers were readily handing out raises in a tight labor market and high inflation environment. \n\n     Median weekly earnings for all workers were 7.4% higher, year over year, at the end of 2022, according to an analysis of newly released Labor Department data. That outpaced the consumer inflation rate of 7.1% in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. \n\n     For some workers, the gains were even larger. The median raise for Black Americans employed full time was 11.3%, compared with the prior year. Weekly pay for workers between 16- and 24-years old rose more than 10%. The bottom 10th of wage earners -- those that make about $570 a week -- saw their pay increase by nearly 10%. \n\n     The pay increases were welcome relief for those groups who have experienced \"decades of pain\" in the labor market, said Aaron Sojourner, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. \"It's been a struggle for those folks to find a productive place in the community where they can contribute and earn and build families and success.\" \n\n     While the labor market remains tight, both wage gains and broader inflation have begun to cool, along with consumer spending. That is the result of the Federal Reserve's efforts to stifle demand and bring down inflation. Workers' ability to continue to receive large pay increases this year is likely under pressure. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast job losses in 2023, after recent strong hiring. \n\n     Here is a look at which Americans saw the largest, and smallest, raises in 2022. \n\n     Better pay increases late last year went to workers who attended college, a reversal from earlier in the pandemic when those who hadn't completed high school saw outsize gains. \n\n     The annual rate of wage growth for workers with less than a high school diploma touched a recent peak in the second quarter of 2022, when it was up 11.1% over the prior year, higher than the 7.6% wage growth during that period for workers with a bachelor's degree or higher. \n\n     But by the end of 2022, the median worker without a high school diploma was making $675 a week, or 3.7% more than during the last quarter of 2021. Wage gains for the less educated plummeted as more low-skilled jobs were filled and economic growth cooled. \n\n     The median worker with at least a bachelor's degree, by contrast, saw 5.5% wage growth from a year earlier to $1,547 a week. Those who only finished high school saw a 5.3% annual raise. \n\n     Wage growth was uneven across racial groups. \n\n     The median Black worker's weekly pay increased at the fastest rate among those measured, growing to $896 from $805 a year earlier. The median Hispanic or Latino worker saw a 4.8% raise to $837 a week. White and Asian workers saw wage growth slightly higher than the overall workforce. \n\n     Still, white and Asian workers continued to earn far more than other racial groups. Median weekly earnings for full-time Asian workers was $1,496, and white workers earned $1,111. \n\n     By sex, weekly wages for the median woman rose 5% to $975 in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. The median man received a 6.6% raise to $1,176 a week. Women had median weekly earnings that were 82.9% of that for men. \n\n     The rate of raises between workers ages 16 to 24 and other age groups widened in 2022. \n\n     It isn't unusual for young workers to experience faster wage growth in percentage terms, largely because they typically start from the lowest base. A person making $15 an hour who gets a 10% raise is now making $16.50 an hour. \n\n     That youngest cohort, earning a median of $716 a week, ended the year with 10.8% annual wage growth, compared with 7.2% for the next-strongest group, aged 25 to 54. The median worker in those prime working years earned $1,134 a week. At the end of 2021, younger workers had 5.2% annual wage growth, and prime-age workers saw a 4.4% gain. \n\n     Older workers, those in the 55-64 bracket and those over 65 years old, who often start from higher bases compared with younger cohorts, saw the slowest wage growth last year, at 2.8% and 3.9%, respectively. \n\n     The lowest-paid workers saw larger raises last year than the top 10% of wage earners. \n\n     Those in the bottom 10% saw weekly pay grow 9.8% from a year earlier at the end of 2022, to $571 a week. The top 10% received a raise of 5.7%, to $2,584 a week. \n\n     Gains for low-income and low-skilled workers drove broader wage growth throughout the post-reopening period of the pandemic, as employers who shed workers in 2020 scrambled to hire, and retain, workers. Quit rates soared as workers found that they could jump to another job for higher wages, with the mismatch between job openings and available workers at an all-time high. \n\n     Those fast gains have cooled. Hiring in sectors such as leisure and hospitality and retail eased toward the end of last year. \n\n     Write to Gabriel T.

Fitch's rating of Ireland is at par with that of S&P Global Ratings and one notch higher than that of Moody's Investors Service, both of which are on a positive outlook, Citi strategists say. \"Fitch recently lauded Ireland for its per capita GDP being above AA-median, favourable government indicators, 'extraordinary' revenue performance and expectation of fiscal metrics to continually improve,\" Citi strategists write.

It will not stop after a single 50 basis-point hike, that's for sure,\" he says. Core inflation--which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy--is still elevated and recent inflation developments aren't compatible with a timely return to the ECB's 2% target, Knot says. Eurozone inflation slowed to 9.2% in December, and recent declines have led markets to slightly scale back their interest-rate-rise expectations.

St. Louis Fed President James Bullard backed rapidly raising the fed-funds rate above 5% to prevent a resurgence of inflationary pressures, believing inflation would not fall back as quickly as the market expects--something that is fueling pessimism, according to Marex's Ruishu Hong.

The U.S. bank expects the eurozone's GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 1% in 1Q 2023, swinging from the 0.5% contraction previously expected, and sees slightly stronger growth also in late 2023 and 2024. Inflation is also expected to fall quicker than previously anticipated, JPM says.

That&apos;s a Problem. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Megan Cassella \n\n     The economic data released this past week appeared to tell a clear story: Consumer demand was falling, as evidenced by slower retail sales. Wholesale prices were cooling, suggesting that further inflation relief was on the horizon. The message seemed to be that the Federal Reserve's policy tightening efforts were working, and equity markets initially climbed on the data. \n\n     But then, Fed officials hit the airwaves singing a different tune. Despite abundant signs of economic slowing, they would remain steadfast in their pledge to hike interest rates in coming months. \"We still have some ways to go,\" said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell. Declines extended through Friday. \n\n     The episode was perhaps the most obvious example yet of the growing disconnect between Wall Street and the Fed over the most likely path forward for monetary policy. Markets have been watching inflation slow over the past several months and anxiously waiting for the central bank to pivot, worried that continued tightening means near-certain recession. But for the Fed, the welcome progress on inflation so far is simply in line with their forecasts -- and their forecasts also say that they still need to raise interest rates above 5%. \n\n     \"Financial markets are like, 'It's cool, but it's not cold.' And the Fed's like, 'It's not even tepid yet,' \" says Diane Swonk, chief economist with KPMG US. \"They're speaking different languages, even though they're both talking about inflation.\" \n\n     That divide is likely to persist, or even deepen, as long as the labor market stays tight and wage growth remains strong. While inflation has clearly peaked and parts of the economy have begun to slow -- two factors boosting market optimism -- Fed officials are laser-focused on ensuring that price growth in nonhousing core services sectors is falling, as well, before they'll be satisfied that their efforts are working. \n\n     The Fed's concern is that even as goods prices deflate and housing costs slow, inflation will hit a floor well above its 2% target, due to persistent strength in those \"supercore\" services. And because of the way that labor costs affect service prices, Fed officials have zeroed in on wages as a way to gauge whether their fears are coming true. \n\n     Some market participants have questioned that approach, arguing that wages were pushed higher by Covid price shocks and will resolve on their own without the Fed forcing a rise in unemployment. Others took recent progress in average hourly earnings in December's jobs report as a sign that, alongside broader economic cooling, the labor problem was easing. \n\n     The Fed isn't convinced. Other signs of progress in the inflation fight are just window dressing until labor demand and supply fall back into line. \"It's one piece of the inflation puzzle that hasn't really fallen into place fully yet,\" says Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \n\n     The longer the market discounts the importance that the Fed places on wages, the harder the bank's job becomes. By its own standards, the Fed has been fairly forthcoming about this, warning that any \"unwarranted easing\" in financial markets in response to policy changes would complicate the path forward. If souring economic data spark a rally due to widespread anticipation that the end of rate hikes is near, it could force a somewhat backward outcome: further tightening and, in turn, a higher risk of a harder landing. \n\n     \"The Fed can't afford for the financial markets to get too far ahead of them right now,\" Swonk says, adding that such a dynamic heightens the possibility of prematurely reflating the economy. \"They know what history tells them, and that's not a risk they're willing to take.\" \n\n     The old mantra of \"don't fight the Fed\" still rings true. But this time, it's because failing to recognize the central bank's path forward risks worse fallout for everyone. \n\n     Write to Megan Cassella at megan.cassella@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 20, 2023 13:23 ET (18:23 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273881Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:56:08.667106Z", "inner_id": 486, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5855, "annotations": [{"id": 6338, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["non-inflation-related"]}, "id": "cbkncyBHpI", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:56:45.477147Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:56:45.477173Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 36.091, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "94991d8b-4109-4b16-8897-0205c6474921", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5855, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Mondelez Expects Fewer Price Increases This Year -- WSJ\n\n  By Jaewon Kang and Kathryn Hardison \n\n \n\n     Mondelez International Inc. said its costs remain high, though the snack and candy producer doesn't anticipate boosting prices for its products at the same level as in 2022. \n\n     Chicago-based Mondelez, which makes Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers, said it has raised its prices because of higher costs of energy, transportation and labor. The company said it increased prices in the U.S. in December and is negotiating in Europe. \n\n     Mondelez Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put said if the company's costs remain steady, as they generally have been over the past couple of months, it isn't likely to raise prices further in the U.S. \n\n     \"We hope those costs will start to come down in the second half of the year,\" he said. \n\n     The company, which also makes Sour Patch Kids candy and Toblerone, said Tuesday that sales climbed 14% to $8.7 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Despite the higher prices, people bought more sweets and candies across all regions except for Europe, the company said. \n\n     \"Price points, yes, they've gone up, but they are still acceptable,\" Mr. Van de Put said. He said the sales growth showed that consumers think of snacks and sweets as an affordable indulgence. \n\n     Shoppers have been buying cheaper versions of food and seeking out deals on everyday staples like bread and cereal, but have been less price-sensitive when it comes to sweets and snacks, supermarket executives have said. \n\n     Across the grocery sector, the dollar value of sales remains higher from a year ago while the volume of products sold has been declining. Food prices continue to rise, though the pace has started to slow and some products, such as fresh fruits, fish and seafood, have become cheaper recently, according to the Labor Department. \n\n     Staffing has improved and the company doesn't have plans for layoffs, Mr. Van de Put said, adding that it will invest in its capacity in the U.S. He said he is monitoring whether a recession materializes, though he said that it might not be as bad as expected. \n\n     Mondelez said its quarterly sales benefited from recent acquisitions, including the purchases of energy-bar maker Clif Bar & Co., confectionary company Ricolino and baked goods company Chipita Global S.A. \n\n     Profit declined to $583 million, or 42 cents a share, from $1 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year ago, led lower by factors such as higher acquisition integration costs and unfavorable impacts from currency and commodity derivatives. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 73 cents, above the 70 cents analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. \n\n     Mondelez is building up inventory after production issues lingered from a strike in 2021, executives said on a call with analysts. \n\n     The company spent less on promotions in 2022 compared with a year ago, Mr. Van de Put said, and expects that spending to remain relatively low in 2023. Mondelez is selling more items and is trying to improve service levels to retailers. \n\n     Mondelez said in December that it would sell Trident, Dentyne and other gum brands in developed markets for $1.35 billion to Perfetti Van Melle Group, as it focuses on chocolates, cookies and other snacks. \n\n     For 2023, the company said it expects organic net revenue to grow 5% to 7%. The company projected high-single-digit growth to its adjusted earnings per share, before factoring in currency fluctuations. \n\n     Mondelez estimated that the impact of foreign exchange will weigh on revenue growth by about 1%, and adjusted per-share earnings will be hit by about 4 cents. \n\n     Write to Jaewon Kang at jaewon.kang@wsj.com and Kathryn Hardison at kathryn.hardison@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 31, 2023 20:03 ET (01:03 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-02-18T20:04:25.273912Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:56:45.702788Z", "inner_id": 487, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 5856, "annotations": [{"id": 6339, "completed_by": 7, "result": [{"value": {"choices": ["inflation-related"]}, "id": "FrjQaD-Fyd", "from_name": "document type", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices", "origin": "manual"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-04T21:57:18.302925Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-04T21:57:18.302951Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 31.839, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 1, "unique_id": "86ff8800-a835-4cbc-9bc4-6e11b940ac72", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 5856, "project": 8, "updated_by": 7, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "f6239547-task1_annotation_user_7.json", "drafts": [], "predictions": [], "data": {"text": "Mondelez International 4Q Sales Climb on Higher Prices -- Update\n\n  By Kathryn Hardison \n\n \n\n     Mondelez International Inc. reported a double-digit boost to its fourth-quarter sales, helped by higher prices for its cookies and candies, as well as added revenue from recent acquisitions. \n\n     The Chicago-based maker of Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers said Tuesday that sales climbed 14% in the recent period to $8.7 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $8.33 billion, according to FactSet. \n\n     Mondelez, which also makes Sour Patch Kids candy, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Toblerone, raised prices in the U.S. again in December as it battled higher costs. Executives said consumers haven't shied away from its snacks and cookies so far. \n\n     Chief Financial Officer Luca Zaramella said during an earnings call that the company expects another year of double-digit inflation, driven by higher costs for labor, energy and packaging. \n\n     Shares rose 1.6% to $66.50 in after-hours trading. \n\n     Other packaged-food giants, including Kellogg Co., Kraft Heinz Co. and Conagra Brands Inc., have also hiked prices, saying the moves are necessary to offset their own climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Conagra, which makes Hunt's ketchup and Slim Jim meat sticks, recently said it doesn't plan on taking more significant pricing actions this fiscal year, assuming inflation doesn't rise further. \n\n     Mondelez's quarterly sales were also led higher by incremental revenue from recent acquisitions, said Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put. That includes the purchases of energy bar maker Clif Bar & Co. and baked goods company Chipita Global SA, deals valued at $2.9 billion and $2 billion, respectively. \n\n     Profit declined to $583 million, or 42 cents per share, from $1 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year ago, led lower by factors such as higher acquisition integration costs and unfavorable impacts from currency and commodity derivatives.
