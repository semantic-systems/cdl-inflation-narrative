The forecasting firm says the slump is mostly due to aggressive rate increases from the Bank of Canada--up 3 percentage points since the start of the year. Sharply higher interest rates will cause costs of servicing elevated household debt to rise, Oxford says, and a housing correction underway to deepen.

         "3M to Cut Costs as Business Cools Beyond Masks--Update \n\n\n\nBy Austen Hufford \n\n     3M Co., maker of coveted N95 face masks used by workers treating coronavirus patients, said sales grew in its medical business while a deepening industrial downturn is weighing on its business overall. \n\n     3M said Tuesday its adjusted sales in the Americas region fell 20% in April as factories suspended production, dentists cut back on operations and office managers bought fewer supplies for workforces at home. \n\n     The company withdrew its guidance for the year, citing uncertainty about the broader industrial economy. While the pandemic has sharply increased demand for some 3M products, most notably its face masks, the company said demand has fallen for other goods in its vast product line, like industrial glues, as factory closures ripple through the industrial economy. \n\n     \"We saw strong growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas of our portfolio experiencing high demand due to the pandemic,\" said Chief Executive Mike Roman. \"At the same time, we experienced weak demand in several end markets that were more severely impacted by actions taken around the world to slow the pandemic.\" \n\n     Shares in 3M rose 3.4% in premarket trading to $158.79, after revenue and profit for the first quarter came in above analyst expectations. \n\n     3M said it was cutting its capital investments this year to about $1.3 billion, down from as much as $1.8 billion planned previously. 3M also said it was furloughing some staff and temporarily shutting down some nonmask production lines due to weakened demand. \n\n     About 25% of the company's factories and warehouses were closed as of earlier this month, 3M said. The company expects the second quarter, which began in April, to be the weakest for the global economy. \n\n     3M has ramped up production of N95 masks, so-called because they block 95% of very small particles including those containing the virus. The company, based in St. Paul, Minn., has doubled global production to around 100 million a month and plans to double production again by early next year. 3M had $100 million in extra face-mask sales in its first quarter. \n\n     The increased production hasn't kept pace with the vast demand for the masks from front-line workers confronting the pandemic. The Trump administration in early April invoked the Defense Production Act to compel 3M to import 166.5 million masks from its facilities in China by the end of June. The Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services have also placed mask orders with 3M of nearly $250 million combined that will further increase domestic mask capacity. \n\n     Some hospitals have said they are turning to unknown resellers for masks they can't find through 3M's main distributors, such as W.W. Grainger Inc. \n\n     \"We received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we've usually received over several years, and in some cases even decades,\" Grainger's Chief Executive Donald Macpherson said last week. \n\n     3M has said it hasn't raised prices on its masks. The company has filed lawsuits against alleged price gougers and is working with authorities to clamp down on allegedly fraudulent behavior. \n\n     The maker of Post-it Notes also said that sales of office supplies decreased as many people began working from home. \n\n     Sales, excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, grew 0.3% in the first quarter. Revenue grew 2.7% to $8.08 billion in its first quarter. Profit rose 45% to $1.29 billion, or $2.22 a share, up from $891 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier. Profit last year was negatively hit by legal charges related to chemicals-product lawsuits. The company posted an adjusted earnings per share of $2.16, above the $2.03 expected by analysts. \n\n     Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 28, 2020 08:24 ET (12:24 GMT)\n",

         "3M to Cut Costs as Business Cools Beyond Masks--Update \n\n\n\nBy Austen Hufford \n\n     3M Co., maker of coveted N95 face masks used by workers treating coronavirus patients, said sales grew in its medical business while a deepening industrial downturn is weighing on its business overall. \n\n     3M said Tuesday its adjusted sales in the Americas region fell 20% in April as factories suspended production, dentists cut back on operations and office managers bought fewer supplies for workforces at home. \n\n     The company withdrew its guidance for the year, citing uncertainty about the broader industrial economy. While the pandemic has sharply increased demand for some 3M products, most notably its face masks, the company said demand has fallen for other goods in its vast product line, like industrial glues, as factory closures ripple through the industrial economy. \n\n     \"We saw strong growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas of our portfolio experiencing high demand due to the pandemic,\" said Chief Executive Mike Roman. \"At the same time, we experienced weak demand in several end markets that were more severely impacted by actions taken around the world to slow the pandemic.\" \n\n     Shares in 3M rose 3.4% in premarket trading to $158.79, after revenue and profit for the first quarter came in above analyst expectations. \n\n     3M said it was cutting its capital investments this year to about $1.3 billion, down from as much as $1.8 billion planned previously. 3M also said it was furloughing some staff and temporarily shutting down some nonmask production lines due to weakened demand. \n\n     About 25% of the company's factories and warehouses were closed as of earlier this month, 3M said. The company expects the second quarter, which began in April, to be the weakest for the global economy. \n\n     3M has ramped up production of N95 masks, so-called because they block 95% of very small particles including those containing the virus. The company, based in St. Paul, Minn., has doubled global production to around 100 million a month and plans to double production again by early next year. 3M had $100 million in extra face-mask sales in its first quarter. \n\n     The increased production hasn't kept pace with the vast demand for the masks from front-line workers confronting the pandemic. The Trump administration in early April invoked the Defense Production Act to compel 3M to import 166.5 million masks from its facilities in China by the end of June. The Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services have also placed mask orders with 3M of nearly $250 million combined that will further increase domestic mask capacity. \n\n     Some hospitals have said they are turning to unknown resellers for masks they can't find through 3M's main distributors, such as W.W. Grainger Inc. \n\n     \"We received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we've usually received over several years, and in some cases even decades,\" Grainger's Chief Executive Donald Macpherson said last week. \n\n     3M has said it hasn't raised prices on its masks. The company has filed lawsuits against alleged price gougers and is working with authorities to clamp down on allegedly fraudulent behavior. \n\n     The maker of Post-it Notes also said that sales of office supplies decreased as many people began working from home. \n\n     Sales, excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, grew 0.3% in the first quarter. Revenue grew 2.7% to $8.08 billion in its first quarter. Profit rose 45% to $1.29 billion, or $2.22 a share, up from $891 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier.

         "Administration Sued On Drilling Permits -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Katy Stech Ferek \n\n     Environmental groups sued the Biden administration on Wednesday, saying that its decision to approve more than 3,500 oil and natural-gas drilling permits in New Mexico and Wyoming violated environmental laws by not taking into account the impact on climate change. \n\n     In their lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the conservation nonprofits Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians say the approved oil and gas wells will release as much as 600 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions, worsening climate change and damaging U.S. ecosystems. \n\n     The federal permitting agency \"has admitted that continued oil and gas exploitation is a significant cause of the climate crisis, yet the agency continues to recklessly issue thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits,\" said Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the nonprofits. \n\n     \"While President Biden has acknowledged the urgency of this crisis, it is time for action to align with rhetoric,\" he said. \n\n     Specifically, the groups said that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which handles oil and gas drilling on federal lands, violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to account for how approving the permits would affect the climate and nearby communities. They also said Bureau of Land Management officials failed to prevent \"unnecessary and undue degradation of public lands,\" a requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. \n\n     Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz declined to comment on the lawsuit. \n\n     The lawsuit is unlikely to have an immediate effect on U.S. energy prices. While the groups asked a judge to declare the permits to be unlawfully granted and to invalidate them, they didn't ask the court to immediately stop drilling-related activity under the permits. \n\n     Roughly 10% of U.S. oil and gas production comes from federal land. Most comes from state and private land. Additionally, federal actions taken on oil and gas drilling development are likely to take months, if not years, to affect U.S. production that could add to supply. \n\n     Since prices began to rise, the Biden administration encouraged drilling companies to increase production and said they could do so using some of the 9,000 approved-but-unused permits. \n\n     The encouragement has frustrated climate groups that said Mr. Biden is violating a campaign-trail promise to end oil and gas drilling on federal lands.

         "Administration Sued On Drilling Permits -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Katy Stech Ferek \n\n     Environmental groups sued the Biden administration on Wednesday, saying that its decision to approve more than 3,500 oil and natural-gas drilling permits in New Mexico and Wyoming violated environmental laws by not taking into account the impact on climate change. \n\n     In their lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the conservation nonprofits Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians say the approved oil and gas wells will release as much as 600 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions, worsening climate change and damaging U.S. ecosystems. \n\n     The federal permitting agency \"has admitted that continued oil and gas exploitation is a significant cause of the climate crisis, yet the agency continues to recklessly issue thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits,\" said Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the nonprofits. \n\n     \"While President Biden has acknowledged the urgency of this crisis, it is time for action to align with rhetoric,\" he said. \n\n     Specifically, the groups said that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which handles oil and gas drilling on federal lands, violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to account for how approving the permits would affect the climate and nearby communities. They also said Bureau of Land Management officials failed to prevent \"unnecessary and undue degradation of public lands,\" a requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. \n\n     Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz declined to comment on the lawsuit. \n\n     The lawsuit is unlikely to have an immediate effect on U.S. energy prices. While the groups asked a judge to declare the permits to be unlawfully granted and to invalidate them, they didn't ask the court to immediately stop drilling-related activity under the permits. \n\n     Roughly 10% of U.S. oil and gas production comes from federal land. Most comes from state and private land. Additionally, federal actions taken on oil and gas drilling development are likely to take months, if not years, to affect U.S. production that could add to supply. \n\n     Since prices began to rise, the Biden administration encouraged drilling companies to increase production and said they could do so using some of the 9,000 approved-but-unused permits. \n\n     The encouragement has frustrated climate groups that said Mr. Biden is violating a campaign-trail promise to end oil and gas drilling on federal lands. Mr. Biden ordered a moratorium on new leases on the day he took office pending a federal report on the leasing program, which came out in November. Before the report, the moratorium was put on hold by a federal-district court judge in Louisiana. In April, Interior officials announced new lease sales for oil and gas drilling. \n\n     The lawsuit also said federal officials ignored how more greenhouse-gas pollution would harm climate-imperiled plants and animals, violating the Endangered Species Act.

Current conditions have left traditional metal pricing models which focus on inventories, unit flow and cost curves as \"irrelevant in dictating short run price,\" he said. \n\n  But, in the longer run, \"China will likely break the bear market,\" Snowdon added. \n\n  China's economic activity is starting to recover from its strict lockdowns and metal intensive industries like automotive are seeing recovering sales already, the analyst said. \"Supportive monetary and green policies are set to fuel metals demand growth and offset continued property slowdown,\" Snowdon said. \n\n  Additionally, high energy prices will continue to constrain metals production with goods like zinc and aluminum highly energy intensive. A number of smelters have been forced into shutdowns this year because of spiraling costs. \n\n  In a separate note, Snowdon's colleague Sabine Schels said base metals were likely to see a resurgence in demand as soon as the third [current] quarter on Chinese economic stimulus, to help further support prices. \n\n \n\n  Write to Yusuf Khan at yusuf.khan@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 11, 2022 08:03 ET (12:03 GMT)\n",

(renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0353 ET - Glencore's trading update should lead to consensus Ebitda upgrades heading into the first-half results, RBC's Tyler Broda says. On coal, the company has guided for a higher price discount to the benchmark and higher costs. However, Glencore has also increased the benchmark Newcastle price forecast for the first half and this is $30 a ton better than RBC expected, Broda says. As for the marketing unit, the company said first half EBIT will exceed $3.2 billion, which is well ahead of the $1.9 billion consensus. \"We continue to expect that Glencore's ability to return cash is unsurpassed in the sector and the company remains structurally better positioned than peers through an economic downturn with coal tightness helping to insulate profitability,\" Broda says.

For BHP, the asset is only a small part of its portfolio, O'Connor notes.

China's increasing steel output could also lead to lower steel prices, while rising iron-ore and coking-coal prices could weigh on earnings, they add.

(renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0353 ET - Glencore's trading update should lead to consensus Ebitda upgrades heading into the first-half results, RBC's Tyler Broda says. On coal, the company has guided for a higher price discount to the benchmark and higher costs. However, Glencore has also increased the benchmark Newcastle price forecast for the first half and this is $30 a ton better than RBC expected, Broda says. As for the marketing unit, the company said first half EBIT will exceed $3.2 billion, which is well ahead of the $1.9 billion consensus. \"We continue to expect that Glencore's ability to return cash is unsurpassed in the sector and the company remains structurally better positioned than peers through an economic downturn with coal tightness helping to insulate profitability,\" Broda says. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com) \n\n  0117 ET - BHP's decision to hang onto its Mt Arthur thermal coal operation and seek to run it until 2030 \"is just one part\" of a process to determine the future of the mine that could heighten political tensions, according to Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O'Connor. \"We will watch with interest the response from NSW [New South Wales] and Federal Australian Government--this will highlight the tensions inherent in a green view versus economic stability view,\" he says in a note. For BHP, the asset is only a small part of its portfolio, O'Connor notes. Still, exiting thermal coal was intended to be more than symbolic, reflecting a pivot in BHP's focus to commodities needed for the energy transition, he says.

They expect the South Korean steel maker's operating profit to hit a near quarterly record of KRW783 billion in 2Q and then weaken gradually. China's increasing steel output could also lead to lower steel prices, while rising iron-ore and coking-coal prices could weigh on earnings, they add.

         "Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Cuts Key Rate, Signals It Will Stand Pat Next Meeting -- Update \n\n\n\nBy Paulo Trevisani and Jeffrey T. Lewis \n\n     BRASÍLIA -- Brazil's central bank trimmed its benchmark lending rate to a record low Wednesday amid volatility in world stock markets and growing concern about rising global inflation. \n\n     The bank's monetary-policy committee cut its benchmark Selic rate to 6.75%, from 7%, and indicated it would hold the Selic at that level at its next meeting. \n\n     \"Provided the committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, at this time the [committee] views the interruption of the monetary easing process as more appropriate,\" the bank said in its note announcing the cut, adding that even with recent market volatility, conditions are favorable for the Brazilian economy. \n\n     The inflation rate in Brazil remains below the central bank's 3% to 6% target range, at 2.9% in January, while unemployment remains high and the economy is just starting to recover from a two-year recession. That combination should permit the central bank to leave the Selic where it stands for months to come, analysts said. \n\n     Brazil's economic output is projected to have expanded 1% in 2017, and forecasts for 2018 are around 3%, a mark last hit in 2013. Joblessness is at 11.8%, but it has been declining for nine months, from a peak of 13.7% in March 2017. \n\n     \"With the economy picking up, inflation will rise in the next few months, \" so it makes sense to stop cutting rates, said Mauro Calil, an economist at Ourinvest bank. \n\n     Declining borrowing costs are already boosting the recovery, as companies use cheaper money to beef up their business. \n\n     \"A few years ago, companies just closed the spigots on new investment. In the past few months, they've started reopening them,\" said Thiago Rocha, director of mergers and acquisitions for Senior Solution, a São Paulo-based financial software and services provider. He said even acquisitions are easier now. \n\n     \"Lower interest rates mean I can make better offers\" to buy companies, he said. \n\n     But the Brazilian government's gaping budget hole and shifting global forces could shorten the low-rate period, economists say. \n\n     The central bank's fight against inflation has benefited from years of near-zero interest rates in the developed world, as investors sought fatter yields in emerging markets and foreign investment supported the local currency, driving prices of imported goods lower. \n\n     Economists say this could change if the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks speed up the pace of rate increases, a possibility reinforced last week by stronger-than-expected job growth in the U.S. \n\n     \"When rates go up in the U.S., there is less money flowing to emerging markets,\" said Tony Volpon, chief economist at UBS in Brazil and a former central-bank deputy governor. \"It's a historic relation.\" \n\n     Mr. Volpon said, however, that if the Fed sticks to its forecast of three rate increases this year, a selloff of Brazilian assets would be unlikely. \n\n     But the risk is worsened by troubled government finances. Brazil ended 2017 with a budget deficit equal to 7.8% of gross domestic product, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 74%, both levels economists considered too high for an emerging market and a source of inflation. \n\n     \"The fiscal fragility is enormous,\" Mr. Volpon said. \"It's a mega-hole that markets have been financing.\" He added that financing could become more expensive if global investors ran away from emerging markets. \n\n     Write to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

         "Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Cuts Key Rate, Signals It Will Stand Pat Next Meeting -- Update \n\n\n\nBy Paulo Trevisani and Jeffrey T. Lewis \n\n     BRASÍLIA -- Brazil's central bank trimmed its benchmark lending rate to a record low Wednesday amid volatility in world stock markets and growing concern about rising global inflation. \n\n     The bank's monetary-policy committee cut its benchmark Selic rate to 6.75%, from 7%, and indicated it would hold the Selic at that level at its next meeting. \n\n     \"Provided the committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, at this time the [committee] views the interruption of the monetary easing process as more appropriate,\" the bank said in its note announcing the cut, adding that even with recent market volatility, conditions are favorable for the Brazilian economy. \n\n     The inflation rate in Brazil remains below the central bank's 3% to 6% target range, at 2.9% in January, while unemployment remains high and the economy is just starting to recover from a two-year recession. That combination should permit the central bank to leave the Selic where it stands for months to come, analysts said. \n\n     Brazil's economic output is projected to have expanded 1% in 2017, and forecasts for 2018 are around 3%, a mark last hit in 2013. Joblessness is at 11.8%, but it has been declining for nine months, from a peak of 13.7% in March 2017. \n\n     \"With the economy picking up, inflation will rise in the next few months, \" so it makes sense to stop cutting rates, said Mauro Calil, an economist at Ourinvest bank. \n\n     Declining borrowing costs are already boosting the recovery, as companies use cheaper money to beef up their business. \n\n     \"A few years ago, companies just closed the spigots on new investment. In the past few months, they've started reopening them,\" said Thiago Rocha, director of mergers and acquisitions for Senior Solution, a São Paulo-based financial software and services provider. He said even acquisitions are easier now. \n\n     \"Lower interest rates mean I can make better offers\" to buy companies, he said. \n\n     But the Brazilian government's gaping budget hole and shifting global forces could shorten the low-rate period, economists say. \n\n     The central bank's fight against inflation has benefited from years of near-zero interest rates in the developed world, as investors sought fatter yields in emerging markets and foreign investment supported the local currency, driving prices of imported goods lower. \n\n     Economists say this could change if the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks speed up the pace of rate increases, a possibility reinforced last week by stronger-than-expected job growth in the U.S. \n\n     \"When rates go up in the U.S., there is less money flowing to emerging markets,\" said Tony Volpon, chief economist at UBS in Brazil and a former central-bank deputy governor. \"It's a historic relation.\" \n\n     Mr. Volpon said, however, that if the Fed sticks to its forecast of three rate increases this year, a selloff of Brazilian assets would be unlikely. \n\n     But the risk is worsened by troubled government finances. Brazil ended 2017 with a budget deficit equal to 7.8% of gross domestic product, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 74%, both levels economists considered too high for an emerging market and a source of inflation. \n\n     \"The fiscal fragility is enormous,\" Mr. Volpon said. \"It's a mega-hole that markets have been financing.\" He added that financing could become more expensive if global investors ran away from emerging markets. \n\n     Write to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

         "China&apos;s 5.5% Growth Target Is a Big Reach -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Nathaniel Taplin \n\n     By the standards of China's rip-roaring economic growth over the past 30 years, \"around 5.5%\" -- the official target for 2022, released over the weekend -- is positively leisurely. \n\n     By the standards of 2022, it will be a heavy lift: Fourth-quarter growth in 2021 was just 4% year over year and the nation is still confronting a stark property slowdown and headwinds to consumption from China's \"zero-Covid\" policy, which mandates tough containment measures for even limited outbreaks. \n\n     Now, new threats are arising: Rapidly rising Brent crude oil prices, now above $120 a barrel, and a likely further slowdown in global growth and trade due to the conflict in Ukraine. China's enormous trade surpluses, which already were expected to decline this year as developed economies further reopen and shift consumption back toward services, will come under more pressure. \n\n     The biggest immediate headwind is rising oil prices. As the world's largest crude importer and energy consumer, China can't avoid a big hit from crude prices which are now up by close to $30 a barrel since late February. Every $20 rise in oil prices knocks about 0.3 percentage point off China's growth, says Goldman Sachs, meaning a hit of half a point this year if oil prices average $135 a barrel for the rest of the year as the bank forecasts. \n\n     Meanwhile, despite some tentative positive signs in late 2021, China's critical property sector -- which typically drives around 20% of the economy -- remains deep in the doldrums. Weekly floor space sold in 30 large and medium-size cities, which had begun to recover in late 2021 following easier mortgage-lending standards, has recently fallen back again. A renewed rash of property developer defaults and payment delays has spooked markets and helped push Chinese bond yields, which had been trending down, back up again. \n\n     The big hope for 2022 is fiscal policy: While the official deficit forecast ticked down marginally and the quota for local government special project bonds has been held steady, a big chunk of unspent bond proceeds from last year could help boost infrastructure spending. \n\n     But there are two problems: First, overall financial conditions appear to be tightening again in the wake of renewed real-estate jitters, meaning higher fiscal spending could be offset by a pullback from households and firms. And second, such special project bonds typically only account for about 20% of total infrastructure spending, notes HSBC. The lion's share is funded by off-budget sources, including land sales -- currently under heavy pressure from the property downturn -- and borrowing by so-called local government financing vehicles. Since the latter are heavily dependent on the bond market, rising yields there will weigh on infrastructure investment, too. \n\n     In a critical political year when General Secretary Xi Jinping is bidding for a third term atop the Communist Party, local officials will be under strong pressure to deliver on growth. That translates into an elevated risk of fudged numbers this year.

         "China&apos;s 5.5% Growth Target Is a Big Reach -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Nathaniel Taplin \n\n     By the standards of China's rip-roaring economic growth over the past 30 years, \"around 5.5%\" -- the official target for 2022, released over the weekend -- is positively leisurely. \n\n     By the standards of 2022, it will be a heavy lift: Fourth-quarter growth in 2021 was just 4% year over year and the nation is still confronting a stark property slowdown and headwinds to consumption from China's \"zero-Covid\" policy, which mandates tough containment measures for even limited outbreaks. \n\n     Now, new threats are arising: Rapidly rising Brent crude oil prices, now above $120 a barrel, and a likely further slowdown in global growth and trade due to the conflict in Ukraine. China's enormous trade surpluses, which already were expected to decline this year as developed economies further reopen and shift consumption back toward services, will come under more pressure. \n\n     The biggest immediate headwind is rising oil prices. As the world's largest crude importer and energy consumer, China can't avoid a big hit from crude prices which are now up by close to $30 a barrel since late February. Every $20 rise in oil prices knocks about 0.3 percentage point off China's growth, says Goldman Sachs, meaning a hit of half a point this year if oil prices average $135 a barrel for the rest of the year as the bank forecasts. \n\n     Meanwhile, despite some tentative positive signs in late 2021, China's critical property sector -- which typically drives around 20% of the economy -- remains deep in the doldrums. Weekly floor space sold in 30 large and medium-size cities, which had begun to recover in late 2021 following easier mortgage-lending standards, has recently fallen back again. A renewed rash of property developer defaults and payment delays has spooked markets and helped push Chinese bond yields, which had been trending down, back up again. \n\n     The big hope for 2022 is fiscal policy: While the official deficit forecast ticked down marginally and the quota for local government special project bonds has been held steady, a big chunk of unspent bond proceeds from last year could help boost infrastructure spending. \n\n     But there are two problems: First, overall financial conditions appear to be tightening again in the wake of renewed real-estate jitters, meaning higher fiscal spending could be offset by a pullback from households and firms. And second, such special project bonds typically only account for about 20% of total infrastructure spending, notes HSBC. The lion's share is funded by off-budget sources, including land sales -- currently under heavy pressure from the property downturn -- and borrowing by so-called local government financing vehicles. Since the latter are heavily dependent on the bond market, rising yields there will weigh on infrastructure investment, too. \n\n     In a critical political year when General Secretary Xi Jinping is bidding for a third term atop the Communist Party, local officials will be under strong pressure to deliver on growth. That translates into an elevated risk of fudged numbers this year. But to hit anything like 5.5% growth in reality -- rather than just on paper -- substantially more stimulus, in particular the monetary variety, will be needed. \n\n     Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 09, 2022 10:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\n",

         "Administration Sued On Drilling Permits -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Katy Stech Ferek \n\n     Environmental groups sued the Biden administration on Wednesday, saying that its decision to approve more than 3,500 oil and natural-gas drilling permits in New Mexico and Wyoming violated environmental laws by not taking into account the impact on climate change. \n\n     In their lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the conservation nonprofits Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians say the approved oil and gas wells will release as much as 600 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions, worsening climate change and damaging U.S. ecosystems. \n\n     The federal permitting agency \"has admitted that continued oil and gas exploitation is a significant cause of the climate crisis, yet the agency continues to recklessly issue thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits,\" said Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the nonprofits. \n\n     \"While President Biden has acknowledged the urgency of this crisis, it is time for action to align with rhetoric,\" he said. \n\n     Specifically, the groups said that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which handles oil and gas drilling on federal lands, violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to account for how approving the permits would affect the climate and nearby communities. They also said Bureau of Land Management officials failed to prevent \"unnecessary and undue degradation of public lands,\" a requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. \n\n     Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz declined to comment on the lawsuit. \n\n     The lawsuit is unlikely to have an immediate effect on U.S. energy prices. While the groups asked a judge to declare the permits to be unlawfully granted and to invalidate them, they didn't ask the court to immediately stop drilling-related activity under the permits. \n\n     Roughly 10% of U.S. oil and gas production comes from federal land. Most comes from state and private land. Additionally, federal actions taken on oil and gas drilling development are likely to take months, if not years, to affect U.S. production that could add to supply. \n\n     Since prices began to rise, the Biden administration encouraged drilling companies to increase production and said they could do so using some of the 9,000 approved-but-unused permits. \n\n     The encouragement has frustrated climate groups that said Mr. Biden is violating a campaign-trail promise to end oil and gas drilling on federal lands. Mr. Biden ordered a moratorium on new leases on the day he took office pending a federal report on the leasing program, which came out in November. Before the report, the moratorium was put on hold by a federal-district court judge in Louisiana. In April, Interior officials announced new lease sales for oil and gas drilling. \n\n     The lawsuit also said federal officials ignored how more greenhouse-gas pollution would harm climate-imperiled plants and animals, violating the Endangered Species Act. It identified about 150 species \"for which climate change is a primary driver of their decline,\" including Hawaiian songbirds, polar bears and coral reefs. \n\n     \"Fossil fuels are driving the extinction crisis, and the Bureau of Land Management is making things worse by failing to protect these imperiled species,\" said Brett Hartl, government-affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \n\n     Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 16, 2022). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 16, 2022 02:33 ET (06:33 GMT)\n",

         "Higher Rates Will Put the Kibosh on Consumption Growth -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ \n\n\n\n  By Justin Lahart \n\n \n\n     If you think inflation is cutting into Americans' spending, just wait to see what higher rates will do. \n\n     The Commerce Department on Friday reported that consumer spending rose 0.4% in August from July, after slipping 0.2% the previous month. However, the Commerce Department's measure of consumer prices, which also happens to be the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, also rose 0.3% in August. So real, or inflation-adjusted spending was up just 0.1%. \n\n     But durable-goods spending is also sensitive to higher rates. This is true of big-ticket items that people borrow to buy, such as cars, and it is also true of items that people buy to fill their newly purchased homes. Spending on furnishings and durable household equipment fell 0.9% in August from July. \n\n     Still, with the average level of real consumer expenditures higher in July and August than in the second quarter, it looks as if spending is on course for an eighth-straight quarter of gains. Given the interest-rate backdrop, however, a ninth could be a stretch. \n\n     There was nothing in Friday's report to give pause to the Fed's plans to keep pushing rates higher. To the contrary, core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy items in an effort to better track inflation's trend, jumped 0.6% from a month earlier and were 4.9% higher than a year earlier. Futures market implied odds of Fed policy makers raising rates by another three-quarters of a point at their meeting in early November, rather than a half point, increased after Friday's report. \n\n     On the other hand, by the time of the Fed meeting, higher rates could be taking a significant bite out of spending. Indeed, that might have already started to happen. \n\n     Friday's report showed that spending on durable goods -- long-lasting items such as cars and toasters -- slipped 0.4% in August from July. Some of that can be chalked up to a continuing shift in spending away the stay-at-home categories that surged after the pandemic hit. In a reflection of more people returning to activities such as travel, services spending rose 0.3%. \n\n     And of course rates are much higher now. Freddie Mac reported this week that the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage hit a 15 year high of 6.7%, which compares with an average level of 5.2% in August. People's ability to afford a home has become severely constrained, and with that the market for household appliances and the like is probably shrinking dramatically. \n\n     Spending has kept up remarkably well so far, but if the Fed keeps pumping the brakes, that isn't going to last. \n\n     Write to Justin Lahart at Justin.Lahart@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 30, 2022 11:20 ET (15:20 GMT)\n",

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET. \n\n  0357 ET - The FTSE 100 struggles for direction after closing at a three-month low on Thursday following interest rate hikes by the Bank of England, Federal Reserve and Swiss National Bank. The index last trades up 0.4% at 7073 points. \"Despite a cautiously positive opening in early exchanges, the previous couple of bruising sessions have wiped out the hard-won gains of 2022, leaving the index down by 4.4% in the year to date,\" Interactive Investor analyst Richard Hunter writes. Glencore shares rise 3.0% after the miner said it expects first-half profit from its trading division to reach the top end of its long-term annual forecast range. Tesco falls 0.7% after the supermarket chain warned of changing customer behaviour as inflation bites. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0353 ET - Glencore's trading update should lead to consensus Ebitda upgrades heading into the first-half results, RBC's Tyler Broda says. On coal, the company has guided for a higher price discount to the benchmark and higher costs. However, Glencore has also increased the benchmark Newcastle price forecast for the first half and this is $30 a ton better than RBC expected, Broda says. As for the marketing unit, the company said first half EBIT will exceed $3.2 billion, which is well ahead of the $1.9 billion consensus. \"We continue to expect that Glencore's ability to return cash is unsurpassed in the sector and the company remains structurally better positioned than peers through an economic downturn with coal tightness helping to insulate profitability,\" Broda says. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com) \n\n  0117 ET - BHP's decision to hang onto its Mt Arthur thermal coal operation and seek to run it until 2030 \"is just one part\" of a process to determine the future of the mine that could heighten political tensions, according to Shaw and Partners analyst Peter O'Connor. \"We will watch with interest the response from NSW [New South Wales] and Federal Australian Government--this will highlight the tensions inherent in a green view versus economic stability view,\" he says in a note. For BHP, the asset is only a small part of its portfolio, O'Connor notes. Still, exiting thermal coal was intended to be more than symbolic, reflecting a pivot in BHP's focus to commodities needed for the energy transition, he says. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle) \n\n  2326 ET - Hyundai Steel's likely strong 2Q earnings, driven by higher steel-plate prices, could soften in 2H as prices of hot-rolled steel and reinforcing rods decline, Nomura analysts Cindy Park and Chloe Kim say in a note. They expect the South Korean steel maker's operating profit to hit a near quarterly record of KRW783 billion in 2Q and then weaken gradually. China's increasing steel output could also lead to lower steel prices, while rising iron-ore and coking-coal prices could weigh on earnings, they add. Nomura keeps the stock at neutral with a KRW42,000 target price. Shares are 4.6% lower at KRW35,550. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com) \n\n  1653 ET - United States Steel predicts 2Q EBITDA of $1.6B and adjusted EPS of $3.83 to $3.88. That's well above analysts' estimates of $1.47B of EBITDA and EPS of $3.29. US Steel joins steelmakers Nucor and Steel Dynamics in forecasting better-than-expected profits for the quarter, driven by high steel prices, especially early in 2Q, and rising demand. \"We expect to continue delivering record performance in the second quarter, with each business segment meaningfully contributing to profitability,\" US Steel CEO David Burritt says. In after hours trading, US Steel shares up 6.5% at $20.85. (robert.tita@wsj.com; @bob_tita) \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 17, 2022 12:20 ET (16:20 GMT)\n",

         "Stock Futures Jump After Inflation Data -- WSJ \n\n\n\n  By Akane Otani, Joe Wallace and Caitlin Ostroff \n\n \n\n     U.S. stock futures jumped after data showed inflation was weaker than expected in October. \n\n     Futures for the S&P 500 added 3.2% Thursday, while futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 soared 4.1% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 2.6%. Changes in futures don't necessarily reflect moves after the opening bell. \n\n     For much of 2022, data on consumer price increases has been bad news for markets. Inflation has proved stickier than many economists anticipated. That has forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at the fastest pace in decades, causing bond yields to soar and the stock market to slump. \n\n     But Thursday's report from the Labor Department offered some rare relief to investors. The core consumer-price index -- which excludes volatile energy and food prices -- rose 6.3% in October from a year earlier, less than the 6.5% increase economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected and down from a 40-year high in September. \n\n     The Fed, which raised rates by 0.75 percentage point last week, has said the size of future hikes will depend on the degree to which inflation slows. \n\n     \"The market is on thin ice already,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, ahead of the release of the data. \"But I can see a window where the market gets this kind of second false dawn, like we saw over the summer, where it gets excited about a peak Fed and peak inflation narrative.\" \n\n     Mr. Redha is still bracing for further declines in stock prices in the coming months because he thinks tighter monetary policy will help push the U.S. economy into recession in 2023. \n\n     Bonds rallied following the release of the data. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 3.932% from 4.149% Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. \n\n     Cryptocurrencies jumped, too. Bitcoin rose to $17,199 after slumping Wednesday. \n\n     The fall from grace of FTX, previously one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has rippled across the digital currency and token markets. Crypto exchange Binance reversed course on a rescue offer for FTX Wednesday, leaving the firm with an uncertain future. \n\n     Overseas, markets were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1%. \n\n     In politics, control of the Senate remained up for grabs, with contests in critical states too early to call and Georgia headed to a runoff. \n\n     Mr. Redha of PineBridge said investors might cheer a return to divided government in the near term. But he said it could make it harder for lawmakers to respond to a potential recession next year. \n\n     Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 10, 2022 08:55 ET (13:55 GMT)\n",

         "Inflation&apos;s Mild Reappearance -- Barrons.com \n\n\n\nEdited by Paul Farrell \n\n     Inflation Returns, Mildly \n\n     Economic Update by Regions Financial April 11: After having been oddly muted, inflation found its voice in March. But rather than a roar, it came back with more of a polite whisper. The total consumer price index fell by 0.1% in March, matching our forecast (the consensus was for no change), with core CPI rising by 0.2%, matching the consensus and ahead of our forecast of a 0.1% increase. It is the over-the-year comparisons, however, that were the focus ahead of today's release. It is the base effects [from the corresponding period of the prior year] -- including the precipitous decline in prices for cellphone service, beginning last March -- that made the over-the-year increases in both the headline and the core CPI look much worse in the March data. While energy prices muted the over-the-year change in the headline CPI, up 2.4%, those base effects were more pronounced in the core CPI, which stands 2.1% higher year-on-year compared with 1.8% higher in February. These over-the-year increases were smaller than many had feared. To which we'll say, just wait a month, as those changes will become more pronounced, beginning with the April data. So, even if inflation itself isn't screaming at us a month from now, the headlines atop the stories about inflation surely will be. \n\n     Retail gasoline prices were flat on a monthly average basis in March, contrary to the sizable increase for which the seasonal adjustment factors were geared. As a result, the seasonally adjusted gas prices were down 4.9%, month on month, which cut 0.2 of a percentage point off the change in the headline CPI. (This cut will disappear in the April data.) \n\n     The reaction in the financial markets to the March inflation data has leaned more toward indifference than fear, and we suspect the reaction within the Federal Open Market Committee will be much the same. The base effects in the inflation data are no surprise, or at least shouldn't be, and discounting the noise from gasoline prices, virtually everyone, the FOMC included, expects inflation to pick up. To the extent that the pickup remains orderly, it won't alter the FOMC's view of the appropriate path of monetary policy. -- Richard F. Moody \n\n     Consumers Flinch, But Are Basically Optimistic \n\n     Commentary and Analysis by Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. April 12: The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for April was preliminarily reported to have declined to 97.8 from a final March reading of 101.4. The April result compared to a median forecast of 100.4, and, while lower than the March outcome (which was the best since 2004), is nonetheless very strong in absolute terms. The decline in April was attributed by the University of Michigan mostly to concerns about a possible trade war, and these worries were heavily skewed by political party, just as the overall expectations of the index have been. \n\n     Earlier outcomes were 99.7 in February, 95.7 in January, 95.9 in December, 98.5 in November, 100.7 in October (previously the best reading since 2004), 95.1 in September, 96.8 in August, 93.4 in July, 95.1 in June, 97.1 in May, 97.0 in April, 96.9 in March, 96.3 in February, and 98.5 in January, 98.2 in December, 93.8 in November, and 87.2 in October of 2016. \n\n     This measure, along with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, is at a robust level, indicating overall consumer attitudes remain very positive. --Joshua Shapiro \n\n     To be considered for this section, material, with the author's name and address, should be sent to MarketWatch@barrons.com. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 13, 2018 15:33 ET (19:33 GMT)\n",

         "Commodities Corner: U.S. Shale Threatens OPEC -- Barron&apos;s \n\n\n\nBy Myra P. Saefong \n\n     Oil is among the biggest commodity gainers in 2019, with prices up by more than 20% -- a testament to the success of the output cuts agreed to by major crude producers at the start of the year. \n\n     However, the cuts may run head-on into the effects of increased U.S. shale production and more output from other sources. That could test the resolve of some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as their nonmember allies, which include Russia. \"High compliance with the OPEC production cuts is impressive and clearly a significant driver of the rally in crude oil futures,\" says Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at Informa Economics. But outside of Gulf producers like Saudi Arabia, compliance with output reductions \"may not necessarily remain high over time,\" he says. \n\n     OPEC members agreed to trim 800,000 barrels a day from October's production levels for six months through June 2019, with Russia and allied producers cutting 400,000 barrels more a day, for 1.2 million barrels in total cuts. \n\n     Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih recently told Reuters that it would be too early to change that pact before OPEC and its allies meet in June. The next official OPEC and non-OPEC meetings will be held on April 17 and 18. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which monitors compliance with output cuts, will hold its next gathering on Monday, March 18. \n\n     The 11 OPEC members achieved 79% of their committed cuts in February, with OPEC's production at 30.8 million barrels a day, according to a S&P Global Platts survey. That's an improvement from the 76% compliance rate a month earlier. Year to date as of Friday, U.S. oil futures have rallied by 29%, while global prices climbed more than 25%, after dropping by 20% or more in 2018. \n\n     The commitment to cuts is surprising given OPEC concerns over loss of market share to producers such as the U.S. U.S. crude production hit a record above 12 million barrels a day in recent weeks, and the International Energy Agency expects the U.S. to lead the rise in global oil production over the next five years. The IEA projection \"suggests the current trend of unconventional shale-production and offshore Gulf of Mexico production growth will likely continue at the expense of OPEC and allied producers,\" says Steeves. \"If OPEC and its allies want to keep oil prices high, they will need to curtail supplies, meaning they will continue to lose market share to the U.S. and others.\" \n\n     Not everyone is convinced shale production will grow at a significant pace. \"While I do see U.S. production growing, shale is expensive,\" says Matt Badiali, a senior research analyst at Banyan Hill Publishing. \"Operators can exist at $50 to $55 per barrel, but they aren't making much money -- and they need credit to operate. So as interest rates rise, it will likely slow U.S. production growth.\" \n\n     For now, oil prices \"have found a balance that could eventually prove precarious,\" with OPEC-led production cuts supporting higher prices, but increased output from the U.S. and elsewhere \"keeping a lid on the market,\" Steeves says. \n\n     He expects U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to trade in the mid-to-upper $50s in the next 30 to 60 days, with a wider range of $48 to $68 a barrel, while Brent trades in the upper $60s, within a wider range of $50 to $70. \n\n     \"What could break the impasse amounts to either a quick rebalancing of global markets that could raise prices or signs of slower global economic growth that could lead to lower oil prices,\" says Steeves. \n\n     Myra P.

         "Eurozone Inflation Jumped in November But Seen Slowing Down in 2022 -- Market Talk \n\n\n\n     1054 GMT - Eurozone inflation rose by 4.9% year-on-year in November, driven mainly by higher energy prices, even when all components saw marked accelerations, Oxford Economics says. There isn't much the European Central Bank can do about higher energy prices and supply bottlenecks in the short-term, but the latest data will add to the debate on the appropriate level of policy support, Oxford Economics' economist Katharina Koenz says. Oxford Economics still expects energy and goods price pressures to ease next year thanks to supply constraints fading. Therefore, the economic research group sticks to its view that inflation will slow meaningfully over the course of 2022.

         "Natural Gas Prices Hit February High on Cold Weather \n\n\n\n \n   By Dan Molinski \n \n\n  --Natural-gas prices rose to their highest level of the month on Monday as continued cold weather keeps demand relatively elevated with spring less than a month away. \n\n  --Natural gas for March delivery ended 4.4% higher at $2.8360 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Monday's gains marked the third straight session of increases and the highest closing level since Jan. 30. \n\n \nHIGHLIGHTS \n \n\n  Weather: Prices rose Monday as weather forecasts continue to erase any hopes for an early spring. \"A cold shot sweeping across the Ohio Valley and Northeast Monday and Tuesday will give a bump in demand,\" said NatGasWeather.com, whose seven-day outlook released Monday calls for \"moderate\" national demand. \n\n  Storage: Adding price-support was weekly data Thursday from the Energy Information Administration showing inventories fell by a larger-than-expected 177 billion cubic feet last week.

Milling-wheat futures are up 1.2% at EUR197 a metric ton in Paris, while U.S. wheat futures are 1.3% higher at $5.79 a bushel in Chicago. The wheat rally stands out because the virus-induced economic downturn is pushing many other commodity markets lower. Among the factors pushing wheat prices higher is a proposal by Russia's Agriculture Ministry to limit grain shipments for three months. Russia has emerged as the world's biggest wheat exporter in recent years. In the 2018-19 season it exported 35.8 million metric tons of wheat, ahead of the U.S. on 25.5 million tons, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Garage Door Service & Repair Inc. explains that since the beginning of the pandemic, people started investing in various home improvements but the supply is slow and the parts are expensive. \n\n  \"Due to Covid-19, we've seen many shutdowns and operations suspended,\" says Thomas Wang, the CEO of Garage Door Service & Repair Inc. \"We've heard of people laid off and many quarantined. Health comes before anything else and so, we all took measures. The entire supply chain is shaking. There are not enough garage door parts. If we cannot deliver, customers cannot get.\" \n\n  The struggles of the global supply chain affected all local garage door companies https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x2KcVW0zQQZ_gmHM4bpyQsUXS4WmQM8DDcMTkh06Sk1E57T8l-_dBvJ-YOYx70AGFvGrtKVDx8EMqZEKz6vzkvcf3MLxHaLWz3Ab9gAHispfv1Xh9hy6rawrZFJnTyh7 . Many industries are involved in the manufacturing of aluminum, glass, and wooden products - anything from garage doors to springs. With the pandemic slowing or suspending businesses, the delays are unavoidable. The prices went up in the steel and wood industries - just to name two. Consequently, the garage door prices went up too. \n\n  \"People in the market for new garage door cables or springs because theirs are old or broken have a difficult time finding replacements. And they believe it's our fault. Naturally, we totally relate to them and stand by their side, but we must say it's not the fault of the companies. It's not just that there's a shortage of garage door parts but also problems in the shipping industry. Since the prices went up, even those who get garage door spring replacements, for example, have to pay double the price and wait double the time.\" \n\n  The paradox is that due to Covid, people invest in home improvements, replacing and repairing their garage door. \"This is the problem,\" said Wang. \"Due to Covid, many people work at home and invest back in their home. We get many orders but since there's a problem with the supply chain, there's delay. The more the delay, the more orders pile up, causing extra delay. And when, finally, people get their garage doors, sometimes, parts are missing.\" \n\n  Find out more about the garage door company at https://www.gds-repair.com \n\n  About Garage Door Service & Repair Inc \n\n  Garage Door Service & Repair Inc is a professional company, specializing in all services and serving the Houston, TX, metro.

         "BOF Governor Says Europe Should Avoid a Recession This Year -- WSJ \n\n\n\n  By Noemie Bisserbe \n\n \n\n  Europe should avoid a recession this year despite high inflation and economic uncertainty, Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau told a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. \n\n  The war in Ukraine and Western sanctions against Russia have taken a heavy toll on the European economy, disrupting trade and driving up inflation. \n\n  \"We have a slowdown without any doubt,\" Mr. Villeroy de Galhau said. \"But activity is more resilient than what we expected three months ago,\" he added. \n\n  The Bank of France chief said he expects inflation to peak during the first half of this year in Europe, before it starts easing later this year. \n\n  Inflation in the eurozone stood at 9.2% in December 2022, down from 10.1% in November. \n\n  \"We will win, at the end of the day, the battle against inflation, have no doubt about that, I take this commitment on behalf of the ECB,\" said Mr. Villeroy de Galhau, who is also a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council. \"We will bring inflation back towards 2% by the end of 2024 or 2025, but this battle is not yet won,\" he added. \n\n  Mr. Villeroy de Galhau said the resilience of the continent's economy would make ramping up interest rates less complicated. \n\n \n\n  This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

         "Helen Of Troy Stock Falls After Earnings Beat Expectations But Full-year Outlook Due To Inflation Impact On Spending -- MarketWatch \n\n\n\n  Shares of Helen of Troy Ltd.  fell 1.5% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the consumer products company, with brands including OXO, Hydro Flask and Braun, reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations but cut its full-year outlook, as rising inflation has prompted consumers to change their spending patterns. Net income for the quarter to Aug. 31 fell to $30.7 million, or $1.28 a share, from $51.3 million, or $2.11 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 beat the FactSet consensus of $2.19. Sales grew 9.7% to $521.4 million, above the FactSet consensus of $519.1 million, as growth in home and outdoor and health and wellness sales offset a drop in beauty sales. In addition to inflation impacting spending patterns, Chief Executive Julien Mininbert said retailers continue to adjust inventories to be better aligned with updated sales forecasts. \"We expect the current external operating environment to remain highly challenging, causing us to lower our fiscal year 2023 outlook,\" Mininberg said. For fiscal 2023, the company cut its guidance ranges for adjusted EPS to $9.00 to $9.40 from $9.85 to $10.35 and for sales to $2.00 billion to $2.50 billion from $2.15 billion to $2.20 billion.

         "RBA Remains Dovish Even as GDP Forecasts Revised Upward \n\n\n\n \n   By James Glynn \n \n\n  SYDNEY--The Reserve Bank of Australia remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero for another three years at least even as the economy surges back to life, bringing with it rapidly rising house prices and a fast-paced tightening of the job market. \n\n  At its monthly board meeting Tuesday, the RBA left its official cash rate at 0.10%, and held fast to a three-year government bond yield target at the same rate. \n\n  RBA Governor Philip Lowe continued to point to a long-term horizon for interest rate increases, saying that while the economy is recovering quickly, the conditions for an interest rate increase are still many years away. \n\n  \"The RBA will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2% to 3% target range. For this to occur, the labor market will need to be tight enough to generate wages growth that is materially higher than it is currently. This is unlikely to be until 2024 at the earliest,\" Mr. Lowe said in a statement accompanying the decision. \n\n  Mr. Lowe also announced upwardly-revised forecasts for GDP growth and lowered the central bank's expectations for unemployment. \n\n  The RBA now expects the economy to grow 4.75% in 2021, up from a forecast of 3.5% issued just three months ago. The unemployment rate is now expected to be at 5.0% by December, compared with a forecast in February of 6%. The jobless rate stood at 5.6% in March. \n\n  Still, recent CPI data confirmed that inflation pressures remain subdued in most parts of the Australian economy. Mr. Lowe said. \n\n  \"A pick-up in inflation and wages growth is expected, but it is likely to be only gradual and modest,\" Mr. Lowe said. \n\n  The RBA will announce a full set of economic forecasts on Friday in its quarterly statement on monetary policy. \n\n   Earlier Tuesday, the impact of record-low interest rates became more visible in data showing mortgage lending to property investors jumped in March. \n\n  New loan commitments for housing rose 5.5% in March, with lending to investors accounting for more than half of the rise. Data earlier this week showed house prices nationally growing at an annual rate of close to 20%. \n\n  While the recovery in the economy poses some challenges for the RBA in the medium term, it is nothing but good news for Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who will release the government's 2021-2022 budget on May 11. \n\n  With fewer people on government benefits and with iron ore prices at 10-year highs, the budget's bottom line is expected to be vastly improved from what was expected at the end of 2020. \n\n \n\n  Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 04, 2021 01:06 ET (05:06 GMT)\n",

         "&apos;Moderate&apos; Recession In Offing For Canada -- Market Talk \n\n\n\n     1527 ET - Oxford Economics says Canada is heading for a \"moderate\" recession, starting in 4Q, with an expected peak-to-trough decline in GDP of nearly 2%. The forecasting firm says the slump is mostly due to aggressive rate increases from the Bank of Canada--up 3 percentage points since the start of the year. Sharply higher interest rates will cause costs of servicing elevated household debt to rise, Oxford says, and a housing correction underway to deepen. External factors--slowdowns in Europe and US--are also playing a role. Oxford anticipates BOC's main policy interest rate to peak at 3.75%, or 50 basis points higher than present level, as the central bank tries to pull annual inflation down from 7% to its preferred 2% target.

         "Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Cuts Key Rate, Signals It Will Stand Pat Next Meeting -- Update \n\n\n\nBy Paulo Trevisani and Jeffrey T. Lewis \n\n     BRASÍLIA -- Brazil's central bank trimmed its benchmark lending rate to a record low Wednesday amid volatility in world stock markets and growing concern about rising global inflation. \n\n     The bank's monetary-policy committee cut its benchmark Selic rate to 6.75%, from 7%, and indicated it would hold the Selic at that level at its next meeting. \n\n     \"Provided the committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, at this time the [committee] views the interruption of the monetary easing process as more appropriate,\" the bank said in its note announcing the cut, adding that even with recent market volatility, conditions are favorable for the Brazilian economy. \n\n     The inflation rate in Brazil remains below the central bank's 3% to 6% target range, at 2.9% in January, while unemployment remains high and the economy is just starting to recover from a two-year recession. That combination should permit the central bank to leave the Selic where it stands for months to come, analysts said. \n\n     Brazil's economic output is projected to have expanded 1% in 2017, and forecasts for 2018 are around 3%, a mark last hit in 2013. Joblessness is at 11.8%, but it has been declining for nine months, from a peak of 13.7% in March 2017. \n\n     \"With the economy picking up, inflation will rise in the next few months, \" so it makes sense to stop cutting rates, said Mauro Calil, an economist at Ourinvest bank. \n\n     Declining borrowing costs are already boosting the recovery, as companies use cheaper money to beef up their business. \n\n     \"A few years ago, companies just closed the spigots on new investment. In the past few months, they've started reopening them,\" said Thiago Rocha, director of mergers and acquisitions for Senior Solution, a São Paulo-based financial software and services provider. He said even acquisitions are easier now. \n\n     \"Lower interest rates mean I can make better offers\" to buy companies, he said. \n\n     But the Brazilian government's gaping budget hole and shifting global forces could shorten the low-rate period, economists say. \n\n     The central bank's fight against inflation has benefited from years of near-zero interest rates in the developed world, as investors sought fatter yields in emerging markets and foreign investment supported the local currency, driving prices of imported goods lower. \n\n     Economists say this could change if the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks speed up the pace of rate increases, a possibility reinforced last week by stronger-than-expected job growth in the U.S. \n\n     \"When rates go up in the U.S., there is less money flowing to emerging markets,\" said Tony Volpon, chief economist at UBS in Brazil and a former central-bank deputy governor. \"It's a historic relation.\" \n\n     Mr. Volpon said, however, that if the Fed sticks to its forecast of three rate increases this year, a selloff of Brazilian assets would be unlikely. \n\n     But the risk is worsened by troubled government finances. Brazil ended 2017 with a budget deficit equal to 7.8% of gross domestic product, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 74%, both levels economists considered too high for an emerging market and a source of inflation. \n\n     \"The fiscal fragility is enormous,\" Mr. Volpon said. \"It's a mega-hole that markets have been financing.\" He added that financing could become more expensive if global investors ran away from emerging markets. \n\n     Write to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

         "Wheat Leads Grain, Soybean Markets Lower \n\n\n\n \n   By Benjamin Parkin \n \n\n  Wheat futures fell to the lowest close in four weeks as uncertainty about Russia's wheat crop continued to weigh down prices. \n\n  Contracts for September delivery fell 2.8% to $5.27 1/4 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade, closing at the lowest point since July 24. \n\n  Traders attributed much of the selling to ongoing debate about the size of Russia's wheat crop and exports this year. Prices rallied last week on reports that Russia's agriculture ministry might curb exports as a result of a tougher growing season. \n\n  But a series of subsequent denials, along with updated estimates that suggested the country's grain crop was larger than expected, prompted traders to erase those gains. The agriculture ministry on Tuesday increased its 2018 production estimate to 100 to 105 million metric tons, traders said, up from 100 million. \n\n  Wheat prices rallied to the highest in years earlier this month as a heatwave in Europe and elsewhere fomented concern about global grain production. That buying interest has since waned. \n\n  Corn and soybean futures also fell on Tuesday.

         "Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Hits New Record -- Market Talk \n\n\n\n     0855 GMT - Eurozone manufacturing is booming, reaching a new purchasing managers' index record set for the second consecutive month, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says. Eurozone manufacturing PMI rose to 62.9 in April from 62.5 in March. \"The past two months have seen output and order books both improve at rates unsurpassed since the survey began in 1997, with surging demand boosted by economies opening up from Covid-19 lockdowns and brightening prospects for the year ahead,\" Williamson says. However, supply constraints are also running at unprecedented levels. The consequence of demand running ahead of supply is higher prices charged by manufacturers, which are rising at the fastest rate ever recorded, Williamson says.

         "Inflation Data Will Put Stocks&apos; Recovery to the Test \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  By Chelsey Dulaney \n\n  U.S. stocks, fresh off their worst week in two years, will be tested again this week by new data on U.S. inflation. \n\n  The Labor Department will release its monthly consumer-price index on Wednesday and its producer-price index for January a day later. The data indicate how fast prices for a variety of goods and services--from food to healthcare costs--are rising throughout the U.S. \n\n  As the The Wall Street Journal's  Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted Monday, the reports are likely to face heightened scrutiny after fears about rising U.S. inflation helped unleash a global stock rout last week. \n\n  Stronger-than-expected wage growth in monthly U.S. jobs data released at the start of the month sent government bond yields to their highest level since 2014, raising concerns among stock investors. U.S. indexes have shown signs of stabilizing after last week' rout, rallying into the closing bell Friday and on track to open higher on Monday. \n\n  Some investors believe stronger wage growth is a sign that inflation is beginning to firm after years of tepid growth. In theory, companies should be able to raise prices if consumers are earning more. \n\n  Higher inflation would ramp up pressure on the Federal Reserve to pick up the pace of interest-rate increases. Higher rates can pressure stocks by making it more expensive for companies to borrow and by reducing the attractiveness of stock dividends. \n\n  The more than 5% drop for U.S. stocks last week was attributed in part to concerns about rising rates, though some investors remain skeptical that the outlook for higher inflation has changed, saying one-off factors like weather drove January's stronger wage growth. \n\n  This week's data, which includes the price index for personal-consumption expenditures--the Fed's preferred inflation gauge--will offer clues on whether the uptick in wages is filtering through to broader measures of inflation. \n\n  \"Markets' worries about higher inflation and tighter monetary policy are overdone in our view,\" said analysts at Oxford Economics. \"Inflation will indeed firm gradually, but we don't see signs an imminent spiral out of control.\" \n\n  Evidence that inflation is sticking to its moderate pace of growth should help ease concerns over a dramatic shift in the economy and could help stocks to recover, analysts say. \n\n  But if those two readings come in hotter than expected, buckle up for another bumpy week for stocks. \n\n  To receive our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter via email,  click here. \n\n \n \n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 12, 2018 08:47 ET (13:47 GMT)\n",

         "UK Job Vacancies Hit Record High \n\n\n\n \n\n  By Jason Douglas and David Hodari \n\n \n\n  LONDON--The number of job vacancies in the U.K. economy hit a record high last month, a sign that employers are struggling to fill posts amid a slowdown in the number of workers arriving in the country from elsewhere in the European Union. \n\n  The Office for National Statistics said Tuesday that there were 824,000 unfilled jobs in the U.K. in the three months through June, the highest number recorded since comparable records began in 2001. \n\n  The sectors showing the largest increase in vacancies were health care and transport, while the hospitality sector showed the largest number of unfilled posts overall. \n\n  The figures come after data Monday showed net migration from the EU--the number of people arriving minus the number leaving--fell to 101,000 in the 12 months through December, the lowest level in five years, as buoyant growth in the eurozone and uncertainty over the U.K.'s future ties to the bloc dented its appeal. \n\n  Tuesday's jobs report showed the labor market remains healthy despite a soft patch for growth at the start of the year and heightened political uncertainty surrounding Prime Minister Theresa May, who is struggling to unite factions of her ruling Conservative Party behind her strategy for exiting the EU. \n\n  The unemployment rate in the U.K. held steady at 4.2% in the three months through May, the ONS said, while the number of people in work rose to 32.4 million, a new record. \n\n  Annual wage growth slowed to 2.7% in the three months through May from 2.8% in the previous three months. Still, cooling inflation is boosting workers' buying power, and an increase in vacancies raises the prospect of faster wage growth in the months ahead as employers bid up pay to attract new staff. \n\n  The figures will likely cement expectations that the Bank of England is poised to lift interest rates next month. \n\n \n\n  Write to Jason Douglas at Jason.Douglas@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 17, 2018 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT)\n",

         "Tyson Foods Says Rising Chicken Prices Fuel Higher Third-Quarter Sales -- Update \n\n\n\n  By Patrick Thomas and Dean Seal \n\n \n\n     Tyson Foods Inc. said raising chicken prices helped keep sales higher in its more recent quarter, but rising costs wiped out any profit growth. \n\n     Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat processor by sales, said its profit margins were hurt by consumers pulling back from spending on premium cuts of beef. The company said the average sales price for beef was 1.2% lower over the three months ended July 2 and was 3.9% lower for pork. \n\n     Chicken prices, meanwhile, surged 20% and 14% in its prepared foods business, which includes brands such as Jimmy Dean and Ball Park. However, the company's profit was flat from a year ago, amid rising costs for wages, animal feed and transportation, the company said. \n\n     For the past two years, meatpacking companies, including Tyson, had boasted historically high profit margins from their beef businesses. Meatpackers have said that because many of their processing plants remain short-staffed, they can't process as many cattle, constraining meat supplies and pushing prices higher while demand has stayed steady. \n\n     The Arkansas-based company said operating income from its beef unit was cut in half for the third quarter to $533 million from $1.12 billion the prior year. Falling demand for steaks sent prices down for beef for the quarter, the company said. \n\n     Operating income margins in Tyson's beef business fell to 10.7% in the most recent quarter, compared with nearly 23% in the same period a year ago. Sales volumes rose slightly in its beef business but were down in chicken and pork. Volumes of its prepared foods business fell nearly 9%, partly because of higher prices and the divestiture of its pet treats business a year ago. \n\n     The company is in the midst of revamping its chicken operations, a business it has long dominated, where it has been struggling to meet demand and staff its plants. \n\n     Demand for chicken has remained high, from supermarkets to fast-food chains battling over crispy chicken sandwiches. Consumers often trade down to chicken from pricier meat options, including beef.  For Tyson's chicken business, which produces roughly one-fifth of the U.S. supply, operating income improved to $277 million for the quarter, compared with a $279 million loss last year. \n\n     Tyson's chicken challenges range from hatching enough chicks to short-handed processing lines in the plants. The company has had to pay more for grain to feed its chickens and wages to keep plants staffed. To meet orders, Tyson has sometimes bought chicken from rival processors. \n\n     Tyson said net income for its third quarter was flat at $750 million compared with $749 million a year earlier, as lower beef margins weighed on the company's quarterly results. The company reported $13.50 billion in quarterly sales, compared with $12.48 billion a year earlier. \n\n     The company's sales results surpassed Wall Street analysts' expectations while its profit numbers fell short. The company posted an adjusted profit of $1.94 a share, lower than the $1.97 analysts polled by FactSet were expecting. Shares fell 3.4% to $84.50 in premarket trading. \n\n     Write to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com and Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 08, 2022 11:01 ET (15:01 GMT)\n",

Adjusted EPS of $1.03 beat FactSet consensus of 87 cents. \n\n  Clearwater pointed to continued strength in the paperboard business and improvements in tissue and said higher pricing in both businesses helping to offset inflation. \n\n  \"Strong paperboard demand continued and prices increased.

         "3M to Cut Costs as Business Cools Beyond Masks--Update \n\n\n\nBy Austen Hufford \n\n     3M Co., maker of coveted N95 face masks used by workers treating coronavirus patients, said sales grew in its medical business while a deepening industrial downturn is weighing on its business overall. \n\n     3M said Tuesday its adjusted sales in the Americas region fell 20% in April as factories suspended production, dentists cut back on operations and office managers bought fewer supplies for workforces at home. \n\n     The company withdrew its guidance for the year, citing uncertainty about the broader industrial economy. While the pandemic has sharply increased demand for some 3M products, most notably its face masks, the company said demand has fallen for other goods in its vast product line, like industrial glues, as factory closures ripple through the industrial economy. \n\n     \"We saw strong growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas of our portfolio experiencing high demand due to the pandemic,\" said Chief Executive Mike Roman. \"At the same time, we experienced weak demand in several end markets that were more severely impacted by actions taken around the world to slow the pandemic.\" \n\n     Shares in 3M rose 3.4% in premarket trading to $158.79, after revenue and profit for the first quarter came in above analyst expectations. \n\n     3M said it was cutting its capital investments this year to about $1.3 billion, down from as much as $1.8 billion planned previously. 3M also said it was furloughing some staff and temporarily shutting down some nonmask production lines due to weakened demand. \n\n     About 25% of the company's factories and warehouses were closed as of earlier this month, 3M said. The company expects the second quarter, which began in April, to be the weakest for the global economy. \n\n     3M has ramped up production of N95 masks, so-called because they block 95% of very small particles including those containing the virus. The company, based in St. Paul, Minn., has doubled global production to around 100 million a month and plans to double production again by early next year. 3M had $100 million in extra face-mask sales in its first quarter. \n\n     The increased production hasn't kept pace with the vast demand for the masks from front-line workers confronting the pandemic. The Trump administration in early April invoked the Defense Production Act to compel 3M to import 166.5 million masks from its facilities in China by the end of June. The Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services have also placed mask orders with 3M of nearly $250 million combined that will further increase domestic mask capacity. \n\n     Some hospitals have said they are turning to unknown resellers for masks they can't find through 3M's main distributors, such as W.W. Grainger Inc. \n\n     \"We received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we've usually received over several years, and in some cases even decades,\" Grainger's Chief Executive Donald Macpherson said last week. \n\n     3M has said it hasn't raised prices on its masks. The company has filed lawsuits against alleged price gougers and is working with authorities to clamp down on allegedly fraudulent behavior. \n\n     The maker of Post-it Notes also said that sales of office supplies decreased as many people began working from home. \n\n     Sales, excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, grew 0.3% in the first quarter. Revenue grew 2.7% to $8.08 billion in its first quarter. Profit rose 45% to $1.29 billion, or $2.22 a share, up from $891 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier.

         "Base Metal Prices Slip But Medium-Term Fundamentals Remain Bullish -- Analysis \n\n\n\n \n\n  By Yusuf Khan \n\n \n\n  Base metal prices have been sliding since the start of the third quarter on mounting recession concerns, but medium-term fundamentals point to higher prices toward the end of this year and into 2023, analysts say. \n\n  Copper prices have been sliding since the start of June, seeing a 21% fall from June 8 to Monday, while nickel prices have fallen 24% in the same period with aluminum also following a similar trend. \n\n  Much of these trends stem from global recession worries and a lack of demand for industrial goods. \n\n  Any concerns over growth tend to hit base metal prices as copper, for example, is considered a bellwether for the global economy given its use in construction. \n\n  However, long-term issues with supply and the possible restart of industrial production in China following Covid-19 lockdowns is likely to mean prices for base metals will rise or remain at a high level in the medium term. \n\n  \"Supply side issues can't be ignored,\" ANZ analysts Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said in a note. \"Mining headwinds associated with environmental, social and governance requirements are exacerbating labor shortages and high energy costs, stalling plans to boost the output of copper, aluminum and nickel,\" the analysts said, adding that this was on top of disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. \n\n  Fitch Solutions furthered this sentiment saying nickel prices in particular were likely to remain high because of disruptions in primary material supply from Russia, while refining rates were still lacking in China due to lockdowns. \n\n  \"In the short term, global production growth will also be constrained by Indonesia's ban on exports of nickel ore, which will limit deliveries of ore to nickel refineries in other countries, notably mainland China,\" Fitch said in a note. In terms of the primary side, copper production has been hampered by strikes in South America, as well as mining halts from indigenous protests. \n\n  Furthermore, exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange have seen sharp drawdowns in inventories for base metals, with ANZ noting aluminum, zinc and nickel are all at multiyear lows creating \"vulnerable to further tightness\". \n\n  \"Metals are trading macro sentiment [currently],\" Goldman Sachs analyst Nicholas Snowdon said in a note. \"Since China's mini-recession in April, prices across the metals complex have disassociated from fundamentals, with copper and aluminum down 20% and 30% respectively over the past quarter,\" he said. \n\n  \"Such behavior highlights to us the exceptional market conditions investors are facing today,\" Snowdon said. Current conditions have left traditional metal pricing models which focus on inventories, unit flow and cost curves as \"irrelevant in dictating short run price,\" he said. \n\n  But, in the longer run, \"China will likely break the bear market,\" Snowdon added. \n\n  China's economic activity is starting to recover from its strict lockdowns and metal intensive industries like automotive are seeing recovering sales already, the analyst said. \"Supportive monetary and green policies are set to fuel metals demand growth and offset continued property slowdown,\" Snowdon said. \n\n  Additionally, high energy prices will continue to constrain metals production with goods like zinc and aluminum highly energy intensive. A number of smelters have been forced into shutdowns this year because of spiraling costs. \n\n  In a separate note, Snowdon's colleague Sabine Schels said base metals were likely to see a resurgence in demand as soon as the third [current] quarter on Chinese economic stimulus, to help further support prices. \n\n \n\n  Write to Yusuf Khan at yusuf.khan@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 11, 2022 08:03 ET (12:03 GMT)\n",

         "Fed Releases Transcripts of 2016 Policy Meetings -- Update \n\n\n\nBy Nick Timiraos \n\n     Transcripts released by the Federal Reserve on Friday revealed the extent of officials' 2016 debate over how fast to move up interest rates after lifting them from near zero at the end of the previous year. \n\n     Much of the discussion turned on geopolitical developments -- first as a slowdown in China and in commodity prices threatened to cool down the U.S. manufacturing sector and later after voters in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the European Union. \n\n     The Fed ended up raising its benchmark interest rate just once in 2016, in December, weeks after Donald Trump won the presidential election. \n\n     Hundreds of pages of transcripts of eight policy meetings in 2016, made public by the central bank after a traditional five-year lag, provide the most complete view of decision-making at the dawn of a transition to \"normalizing\" policy. \n\n     While the policy outcomes of the meetings were announced shortly after they ended, and minutes of the sessions summing them up were released three weeks later, the verbatim transcripts of the discussions weren't public until now. \n\n     The transcripts offered new insight into the thinking of several key players still on the policy-making scene, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who was then entering his fifth year as a governor, and then-Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who is now Treasury secretary. \n\n     They show officials grappling that December with how the election of Mr. Trump, who had campaigned on promises to revamp government spending, taxes and trade policy, would reshape the outlook for growth and inflation in the years ahead. \n\n     \"If the incoming administration changes economic policy in several areas as radically as promised during the election campaign, we will...have to develop an approach to making monetary policy in a setting of much greater\" uncertainty, said Stanley Fischer, then the Fed's vice chairman. \n\n     They also reveal officials' sense of humor at their hourslong policy deliberations. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard opened his discussion of the economy on Dec. 13, 2016, with a joke. \"According to some interpretations of the Book of Revelations, when three unusual events occur together, they may be a sign that the apocalypse is near. Let's take stock,\" he began. \"The Chicago Cubs have won the World Series, Donald Trump has won the presidency, and Bob Dylan has won a Nobel Prize.\" \n\n     The transcripts for the meeting show officials mused about how the election revealed broader frustrations with Americans who felt left behind in the economy. \n\n     Mr. Trump had criticized the Fed during the campaign when the Republican nominee, in September of that year, had sharply attacked Ms. Yellen, arguing that the central bank was holding rates down to help Democrats at the ballot box. \n\n     Mr. Fischer, Ms. Yellen's second-in-command, warned that under Mr. Trump, \"There will likely also be challenges to the current operating procedures of the Federal Reserve and to its independence.\" \n\n     \"Whatever happens, it is critical that we behave -- and be seen to behave -- with the goal of achieving our dual mandate and with a calmness that we have shown in the past,\" Mr. Fischer said. \"The bottom line is very simple: We must do our job.\" \n\n     Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 14, 2022 18:36 ET (23:36 GMT)\n",

         "Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment to Buy DVD Kiosk Company Redbox -- WSJ \n\n\n\n  By Will Feuer \n\n \n\n     Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment Inc. said it has reached a deal to buy the DVD rental kiosk operator Redbox Entertainment Inc., combining two legacy entertainment companies seeking to compete in the streaming era. \n\n     The deal, which would issue 4.6 million shares of Chicken Soup to Redbox, is valued at $36.4 million, according to a Chicken Soup spokeswoman. Chicken Soup will also assume about $321 million of Redbox's outstanding debt. \n\n     The deal gives Chicken Soup, which operates the streaming service Crackle and its namesake streaming service, a deeper entertainment footprint as it aims to compete with the likes of Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co. and other streaming platforms. \n\n     It also comes after years of struggles at Redbox, which is best known for the more than 38,000 red DVD rental kiosks stationed at grocery stores and other retailers. \n\n     Redbox's rental business took a hit during the pandemic due to the limiting of theatrical releases it relies on. It warned earlier this year that its streaming service has failed to drive enough revenue to make up for the rising costs to build it out. It is now saddled with significant debt. \n\n     Redbox stock has tumbled almost 80% from a high last year after it returned to the public markets through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. \n\n     Chicken Soup operates a series of ad-supported streaming services including Crackle, which it bought from Sony in 2020 and Popcornflix Kids. \n\n     Chicken Soup Chief Executive William Rouhana Jr. said the deal will help the company grow in streaming as the industry shifts toward an ad-supported model amid rising competition with subscription services and rising inflation. \n\n     Some of the largest streaming services, including Netflix and Disney, have said in recent months they plan to roll out ad-supported options. \n\n     Chicken Soup said Redbox shareholders will get a fixed exchange ratio of 0.087 share of common stock in Chicken Soup for each Redbox share they own. Once the deal closes, expected in the second half of the year, Redbox shareholders will own about 23.5% of the combined company, Chicken Soup said. Lender HPS Investment Partners will own about 4.5% of the combined company, diluting current shareholders' ownership. \n\n     Shares of Redbox fell 24% to $4.23 a share in recent trading. \n\n     Chicken Soup stock rose almost 4% to $8.21 a share. Shares were down almost 43% so far this year. \n\n     Chicken Soup also reported first-quarter results Wednesday, with revenue up 26% to $29.2 million, slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations. \n\n     The company's net loss widened to $14.1 million, or 92 cents a share, compared with $9.2 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected a net loss of 70 cents a share. \n\n     Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 11, 2022 10:53 ET (14:53 GMT)\n",

         "China&apos;s 5.5% Growth Target Is a Big Reach -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Nathaniel Taplin \n\n     By the standards of China's rip-roaring economic growth over the past 30 years, \"around 5.5%\" -- the official target for 2022, released over the weekend -- is positively leisurely. \n\n     By the standards of 2022, it will be a heavy lift: Fourth-quarter growth in 2021 was just 4% year over year and the nation is still confronting a stark property slowdown and headwinds to consumption from China's \"zero-Covid\" policy, which mandates tough containment measures for even limited outbreaks. \n\n     Now, new threats are arising: Rapidly rising Brent crude oil prices, now above $120 a barrel, and a likely further slowdown in global growth and trade due to the conflict in Ukraine. China's enormous trade surpluses, which already were expected to decline this year as developed economies further reopen and shift consumption back toward services, will come under more pressure. \n\n     The biggest immediate headwind is rising oil prices. As the world's largest crude importer and energy consumer, China can't avoid a big hit from crude prices which are now up by close to $30 a barrel since late February. Every $20 rise in oil prices knocks about 0.3 percentage point off China's growth, says Goldman Sachs, meaning a hit of half a point this year if oil prices average $135 a barrel for the rest of the year as the bank forecasts. \n\n     Meanwhile, despite some tentative positive signs in late 2021, China's critical property sector -- which typically drives around 20% of the economy -- remains deep in the doldrums. Weekly floor space sold in 30 large and medium-size cities, which had begun to recover in late 2021 following easier mortgage-lending standards, has recently fallen back again. A renewed rash of property developer defaults and payment delays has spooked markets and helped push Chinese bond yields, which had been trending down, back up again. \n\n     The big hope for 2022 is fiscal policy: While the official deficit forecast ticked down marginally and the quota for local government special project bonds has been held steady, a big chunk of unspent bond proceeds from last year could help boost infrastructure spending. \n\n     But there are two problems: First, overall financial conditions appear to be tightening again in the wake of renewed real-estate jitters, meaning higher fiscal spending could be offset by a pullback from households and firms. And second, such special project bonds typically only account for about 20% of total infrastructure spending, notes HSBC. The lion's share is funded by off-budget sources, including land sales -- currently under heavy pressure from the property downturn -- and borrowing by so-called local government financing vehicles. Since the latter are heavily dependent on the bond market, rising yields there will weigh on infrastructure investment, too. \n\n     In a critical political year when General Secretary Xi Jinping is bidding for a third term atop the Communist Party, local officials will be under strong pressure to deliver on growth. That translates into an elevated risk of fudged numbers this year. But to hit anything like 5.5% growth in reality -- rather than just on paper -- substantially more stimulus, in particular the monetary variety, will be needed. \n\n     Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 09, 2022 10:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\n",

         "Credit Markets: Treasurys Fall Amid Upbeat Indicators -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Daniel Kruger \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (February 2, 2019). \n\n     U.S. government bond prices fell Friday after economic data showed the labor market remained robust and manufacturing rebounded in January. \n\n     The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note notched its biggest one-day increase since Jan. 4, settling at 2.690%, from 2.631% Thursday. The increase snapped a streak of four consecutive declines. \n\n     Yields, which rise when bond prices decline, climbed after the Labor Department said the economy added 304,000 jobs in January and average hourly earnings rose 3.2% from the year before. \n\n     Yields then extended their gains after a separate report showed that growth picked up for U.S. manufacturers in January, a sign strong factory-sector demand and output overrode uncertainty surrounding the partial government shutdown in the first month of the year. \n\n     The Institute for Supply Management said Friday that its manufacturing purchasing-managers index rose to 56.6 in January from 54.3 in December. Readings above 50 indicate expansion whereas readings below that level denote contraction. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the index to slip slightly to 54.0. \n\n     The data suggests that there is little reason for investors to expect the economy will slow down, and a continuation of these kinds of gains as the year progresses could revive discussions about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates later in the year, said Michael Cloherty, head of interest-rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \n\n     Concerns about a downturn, or that the Fed could potentially cut rates this year, have \"become less and less realistic given those gains,\" Mr. Cloherty said. \n\n     Investor sentiment has showed signs of improvement this year, as stocks posted their best January performance in 30 years and the yield premium over risk-free Treasurys that investors have needed to purchase corporate bonds and high-yield debt narrowed during the past month. \n\n     Yields were also pushed higher as investors looked ahead to the rising supply of U.S. government debt, which is expected to grow as the Treasury is scheduled to sell a total of $84 billion of three-, 10- and 30-year securities next week. That compares with $66 billion for the same series of offerings last year. \n\n     Write to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  February 02, 2019 02:32 ET (07:32 GMT)\n",

         "Larry Summers Warns of &apos;Tragedy&apos; If Inflation Isn&apos;t Licked. He&apos;s Right. -- Barrons.com \n\n\n\nBy Ben Levisohn \n\n     Central banks need to finish the job on inflation, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned, and failing to do so would be the ' greatest tragedy.' \n\n     Summers was speaking on a CNBC panel in Davos about how the pandemic set the stage for a surge in inflation. Basically, the amount of money spent on fiscal stimulus combined with the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and bond buying was far more than the U.S. economy needed to get through the lockdowns. The result: Inflation the likes we haven't seen in decades. \n\n     Central banks, particularly in the U.S. acted and acted quickly. The Federal Reserve raised rates from near 0% to more than 4%, and another increase is expected in February. And as a result, inflation has started falling from its 2022 peak. The Consumer Price Index rose 6.5% year over year in December, down from 7.1% in November. \n\n     The financial markets, though, want to see the Fed stop, and maybe even start cutting. The two-year Treasury yield has slipped to 4.17%, down from its November high of 4.726%, a sign that investors are pricing in fewer rate hikes. The Fed Funds futures market, meanwhile, is showing only a 57% chance that rates hit a range of 4.75% to 5% by May. \n\n     The Fed shows no signs of slowing down. Fed speakers this week kept talking up the need for more rate hikes, perhaps taking them as high as 5.25% to 5.5%, and holding them there until inflation is defeated. That's exactly what Summers wants to see. \n\n     \"The greatest tragedy in this moment would be if central banks were to lurch away from a focus on assuring price stability prematurely and we were to have to fight this battle twice,\" Summers said. \n\n     That might be painful for the stock market, however, which seems to want to price in a pivot any chance it gets. \"[Sustainable] rallies for the broad equity indexes have historically required investors to start anticipating actual rate cuts, rather than a mere end to hikes,\" writes UBS strategist Mark Haefele. \"And here, uncertainty is higher. Tight labor markets and continued hawkish commentary mean it is likely to be hard for financial markets to fully anticipate interest rate cuts, and we should therefore expect more volatility in the near term.\" \n\n     It's likely to be difficult for the stock market no matter what the Fed does. If it keeps hiking rates, economic growth is likely to take a big hit. If it pivots too soon, inflation will come roaring back, and force another set of rapid rate hikes, which could be even more devastating. \n\n     And that is Summer's point. Get inflation under control and a lot of good will come. Let it fester, and we'll have to go through 2022 all over again -- or worse. \n\n     Write to Ben Levisohn at ben.levisohn@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 20, 2023 11:25 ET (16:25 GMT)\n",

         "Will Stocks Be a Trade-War Casualty? -- Barrons.com \n\n\n\n     The problem with trade wars is that no one really knows whether one's begun. There's been no ringing declaration war from the U.S., Europe or China, but rather a gradual ratcheting up of tariffs. \n\n     Michael Cembalest, a top strategist at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management, isn't waiting for a formal notification. He's already talking up a defensive posture and warning that stocks' momentum could be reversed if the tit for tat escalates. \n\n     \"The economic and profit news is good enough that if we only had to deal with higher Fed rates, modestly higher 10-year rates, and the implications of growing fiscal deficits, the next 12 months or so would bring 7%-10% returns on large-cap stocks,\" Cembalest tells my Barron's colleague Leslie P. Norton . \"Throw the tariffs into that mix, and the balance could turn negative.\" \n\n     The U.S. currently has $34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports, with $16 billion more to kick in a month from now. But for financial leaders to start using the term \"trade war,\" things would have to ratchet up quite a bit. UBS economists' bar is a \"30% tariff on almost all Chinese imports, a similar response from Beijing and 25% levies on U.S. car imports, matched by all trading partners,\" writes The Wall Street Journal. At Wells Fargo, the view is that \"trade war\" means surcharges of 50% or more. \n\n     Semantics aside, Cembalest already sees an impact on the U.S. economy. Producer prices are growing faster, and passing through to consumers. Capital spending \"just rolled over\" despite strong corporate earnings. And industrial metals prices have risen. \n\n     \"A lot rides on the next three months,\" he says. The Trump administration has another $200 billion of tariffs on China scheduled to take effect in October. Is it a bluff? Will China blink? Will we wind up with 1920s-type trade barriers? Stay tuned. \n\n     --Steve Garmhausen \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 18, 2018 14:56 ET (18:56 GMT)\n",

Here's essential reading on today's developments. \n\n  MUST READS FROM WSJ CITY \n\n  A relatively hawkish Bank of England held its policy rate at a near-record low of 0.5% but left the door open to a hike in August, and struck a positive note about the outlook for UK economic growth and inflation. And in moves that suggested the divergent paths of the world's largest central banks are gripping smaller ones too, the Swiss National Bank kept its key rate deep in negative territory and Norway's central bank kept rates at a record low. \n\n  Ministers from some of the world's biggest oil producers were nearing a deal to lift crude output by about one million barrels a day in an effort to tame recently high prices -- though officials said an agreement might fall well short of that goal in practice. \n\n  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich resigned after the company determined he violated company policy during a past, consensual relationship with an Intel employee. The company said that a continuing investigation by internal and external counsel confirmed a violation of Intel's 'non-fraternisation policy,' which applies to all managers. \n\n  Walt Disney's blockbuster track record, along with some unique quirks of comic book history, explain why it can top Comcast's bid for 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets, writes Aaron Back for Heard on the Street. \n\n  At asset managers, scientists aren't about to outnumber the phones found on the trading floors. But many traditional stock- and bond-picking firms are now spending 'tens of millions of dollars' each to hire mathematical and computer experts. They want these recruits to dive into pools of data in search of trading ideas and blind spots. \n\n  Troubled private-equity firm Abraaj Group said it agreed to sell its Latin America, Sub Saharan Africa, North Africa and Turkey funds-management business to Colony Capital, an investment-management firm. The sale of a portion of Abraaj's private-equity business is unlikely to bring an end to the firm's ongoing troubles, as creditors, investors and regulators continue to scrutinise it. \n\n  US private-equity firm Carlyle Group raised a new fund aimed at investing across the Asia-Pacific region in technology, consumer and other sectors, many of which are powered by a quickly ascendant middle class.

These Stocks Are Seeing Big Gains. -- Barrons.com \n\n\n\nBy Avi Salzman \n\n     U.S.-traded crude oil closed above $70 for the first time in two and a half years on Tuesday, another sign that oil has avoided the mini-slump hitting other commodities in the past few weeks. \n\n     West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. benchmark, settled up 1.2% to $70.05. It was the highest close since Oct. 16, 2018.

Demand is rising and supply is restrained, setting up a prolonged period of strength, analysts say. Stocks whose success is dependent on higher oil prices -- some of which have more debt -- have been outperforming as oil climbs. \n\n     Among the winners are Ovintiv (ticker: OVV) and Continental Resources (CLR), both of which have more than tripled from their 52-week lows.

Emerging markets are getting their hands on more vaccines and that is very positive for oil prices. Brazil's health minister noted they have enough Covid vaccine doses.\" \n\n     In addition, oil supply remains muted as producers are focusing on their most productive wells and delaying drilling in areas that may not be as profitable.

         "How Inflation Hit Households in July: Higher Prices for Food, Electricity and Alcohol Consumed at Home -- WSJ \n\n\n\n  By Rina Torchinsky \n\n \n\n     U.S. consumers paid more to eat in July, facing higher prices for peanut butter, meats, eggs and other foods than the month before, the Labor Department said Wednesday. \n\n     Shoppers also saw prices climb last month for a range of other goods and services, including medical care, new vehicles and household furnishings, as well as falling prices for used cars and clothing. \n\n     Prices for gasoline, air travel and hotels also eased in July, good news for Americans hoping to squeeze in another vacation this summer. \n\n     Add it all up, and the department's overall inflation measure -- the consumer-price index -- was flat in July compared with June. But the CPI was 8.5% percent higher in July from a year before -- a rapid rate, though slower than June's 9.1% annual pace -- which was the fastest since November 1981. \n\n     Here is a sample of some of the notable seasonally adjusted price changes in the department's categories of goods and services in July from June. \n\n     Energy \n\n     Gasoline prices dropped 7.7% in July, after shooting up for months due to high crude prices and a shortage of refinery capacity. The average cost of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in the U.S. peaked above $5 in June and has fallen since then to around $4 a gallon, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider owned by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. \n\n     Natural-gas prices fell 3.6% from the prior month, while electricity prices rose 1.6%. \n\n     Food \n\n     Food prices overall rose 1.1% in July, the seventh consecutive monthly increase of 0.9% or more. They climbed across all of the major categories, including meats, poultry, fish and eggs, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, nonalcoholic beverages, food eaten at home and food eaten away from home. \n\n     Breakfast eaters saw prices rise not just for eggs, but also for breakfast sausage, bacon, toast, cereals and bakery products. Coffee prices rose 3.5%. \n\n     Peanut butter sandwich fans faced higher prices to assemble the lunchbox staple. Prices for peanut butter and breads other than white bread climbed 3.5%. White bread prices climbed 2%. \n\n     Hot dog grillers got a break with the 6.1% fall in the prices of frankfurters. \n\n     Transportation \n\n     Airline fares declined 7.8% in July, as the industry struggled with staffing shortages and travelers faced frequent delays. Car and truck rental prices fell 9.5%. Prices rose 0.6% for new vehicles, while declining 0.4% for used cars and trucks. \n\n     Housing and Lodging \n\n     Rent prices increased 0.7% in July. Owners' equivalent rent -- what homeowners would have to pay each month to rent their own houses -- rose 0.6%. Meanwhile, prices for lodging away from home -- such as hotel room rates -- declined 2.7% in July, as travelers ventured out after earlier pandemic restrictions. \n\n     Alcoholic Beverages \n\n     Drinkers saw prices rise for all alcoholic beverages consumed at home, including whiskey (up 0.6%), wine (up 0.1%), beer, ale and other malt beverages (up 0.5%), and distilled spirits excluding whiskey but including tequila (up 0.8%). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 10, 2022 15:42 ET (19:42 GMT)\n",

         "Natural-Gas Prices Surge as Summer Cooling Season Switches On -- WSJ \n\n\n\n  By Ryan Dezember \n\n \n\n     Natural-gas prices are heating up ahead of air-conditioning season, adding pressure to household budgets and manufacturing costs. \n\n     Futures for June delivery reached $9.399 per million British thermal units on Wednesday before ending at $8.971, up roughly 2% on the day and more than 20% this month. Prices have tripled over the past year and haven't been so high since 2008, which was before frackers flooded the market with cheap shale gas. \n\n     Natural gas has been a major driver of inflation, and lately prices have been accelerating. In addition to heating and cooling, gas prices factor into the cost of producing electricity, fertilizer, plastic, cement, steel and glass. Profits are being pinched at businesses ranging from beer-box makers and wallboard manufacturers to bitcoin miners, and higher costs are trickling down to prices for consumers and putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. \n\n     Fuel traders and analysts say prices could climb even higher if hot weather arrives and air conditioners are cranked up before enough gas can be injected into storage facilities ahead of winter, when the fuel is burned for heat. \n\n     U.S. gas inventories on May 13 were about 15% lower than the five-year average, according to the Energy Information Administration. The EIA is scheduled on Thursday morning to report inventory data through last week. \n\n     Inventories have been whittled down by strong demand for liquefied natural gas among European buyers replacing Russian gas and domestic drillers who have been slow to increase production despite the highest prices in years. Meanwhile, the highest Appalachian coal prices ever and reduced hydropower due to drought in the U.S. West have boosted demand for electricity generated by burning gas. \n\n     \"There's almost no ceiling for natural gas,\" said Kent Bayazitoglu, analyst at the energy consultant Baker & O'Brien Inc. \"You can reduce your driving a lot easier than you can reduce your natural-gas consumption.\" \n\n     Hedge funds and other speculators this month reduced their bets on rising prices as futures climbed from about $7 at the end of April, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. The bullish bets that remain are nearly equal to outstanding short positions, or wagers that prices will fall. \n\n     The trading firm Ritterbusch & Associates told clients Wednesday that low inventories and the high number of bets on falling prices were the reasons it lifted its forecast for July futures to rise as high as $10, up from $9. The idea is that if prices keep rising, traders with short positions will have to buy futures to close out their bets, pushing up prices even more. \n\n     High oil and gasoline prices could help keep a lid on natural-gas prices by encouraging drilling in such places as West Texas, where crude is the target and a lot of gas is the byproduct, Mr. Bayazitoglu said. He expects natural-gas prices to ease once the first big summer heat wave passes. \n\n     \"It's like a roller coaster,\" he said. \"You don't get nervous going down, but going up.\" \n\n     Write to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 26, 2022 05:30 ET (09:30 GMT)\n",

         "Major Changes Ahead for Prescription-Drug Payments -- WSJ \n\n\n\nBy Joseph Walker \n\n     Drug-pricing rules embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act will trigger the most significant changes in nearly two decades to the way the government pays for prescription drugs, including caps on patient spending and drugmaker price increases. \n\n     Legislation that the House of Representatives passed Friday would raise an estimated $739 billion in revenue and spend $433 billion on climate and energy programs as well as health-insurance subsidies for millions of people covered under the Affordable Care Act. President Biden is expected to sign the bill soon. \n\n     The legislation also allows for direct-price negotiations on a limited number of medications and puts a cap on the amount that seniors on Medicare pay for medicines annually. Starting in 2025, people who are covered under Medicare's prescription-drug program known as Part D will have annual out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000, compared with potentially unlimited spending under current law. In addition, Medicare beneficiaries' copays for insulin starting next year would be limited to $35 a month. \n\n     The out-of-pocket spending cap would benefit patients who take expensive medications such as some used to treat cancer that can cost patients more than $10,000 annually in copays and coinsurance, said Stacie B. Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \n\n     The most contentious aspects of the drug-pricing provisions are those requiring Medicare to directly negotiate prices for certain drugs starting in 2026, and requiring drugmakers next year to pay rebates to the government for revenue they make from price increases above the inflation rate. \n\n     Democrats passed the bill using a procedure called budget reconciliation that allows them to bypass a Republican filibuster. Using the procedure meant narrowing the inflation-cap rebate provision to Medicare drug spending and excluding the private commercial market, which would have had more far-reaching effects. \n\n     The pharmaceutical industry opposes the negotiation and inflation-cap measures, which it said would give the government too much power to set prices and impinge on the development of new drugs. \n\n     \"The bill will impose price controls, and price controls will stymie innovation,\" Amgen Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway said on an earnings call in early August. \n\n     The revisions represent a watershed change to the Medicare Part D program, which was enacted in 2003 with a prohibition on government negotiation of drug prices. The program was created to be operated by private health insurers who compete against each other by offering the lowest premiums to consumers, providing an incentive to negotiate the lowest prices possible. \n\n     The program hasn't worked well for patented medicines that are protected from competition, advocates of the government negotiation say. Changes in the new legislation will help check prescription-drug costs, some advocates say. \n\n     \"This is going to be really impactful and put money back in people's pockets,\" said Bill Sweeney, senior vice president for government affairs at AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group for older adults. \n\n     Starting in 2026, Medicare will negotiate prices for 10 drugs in Part D from a list of 50 drugs with the highest program spending that have been on the market for nine or 13 years and lack generic competition. Additional drugs would be added each year afterward. \n\n     In 2028, Medicare will start negotiating prices for high-spending drugs in the Part B program, which covers outpatient medical care such as drugs that are administered by healthcare professionals. \n\n     Write to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (August 15, 2022). \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 15, 2022 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\n",

         "Traeger Shares Tumble, Touch New Lows on Guidance Shortfall &gt;COOK \n\n\n\n \n   By Colin Kellaher \n \n\n  Shares of Traeger Inc. slid more than 10% and hit a new all-time low on Thursday after the grill-maker forecast 2022 results well below Wall Street's expectations, leading a wave of Wall Street analysts to take dimmer views on the stock. \n\n  The Salt Lake City company said it expects sales growth to moderate this year after two years of accelerated retail activity driven in part by the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept more people at home and fueled a surge in popularity of at-home barbecuing and grilling. \n\n  Traeger said it expects surging inflation and geopolitical turmoil will crimp consumer sentiment and discretionary spending, while continuing global supply-chain issues will pressure its margins. \n\n  As a result, Traeger said it expects revenue of $800 million to $850 million this year, representing growth of 2% to 8% after a nearly 44% rise in 2021, and adjusted Ebitda of $70 million to $80 million, down from $109 million last year. \n\n  Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting Traeger to post revenue of $956.5 million and adjusted Ebitda of $121.9 million for 2022. \n\n  The guidance shortfall led several analysts to cut their ratings and/or price targets on Traeger's shares. \n\n  Among the sharpest cuts, analysts at Stifel downgraded the stock to hold from buy and slashed their target price to $7.50 from $26, saying their prior constructive thesis was predicated on share gains and growing household penetration, and that they had expected \"a more graceful anniversary\" of government stimulus and channel fill that helped results early last year. \n\n  Stifel added that it now sees more risk than upside potential for the stock, noting that Traeger's leverage is higher than it is comfortable with, given signs of weak demand and economic uncertainty. \n\n  At least a half dozen other Wall Street firms also lowered their targets for Traeger shares, but all of the commentary wasn't negative. \n\n  BMO Markets, which trimmed its price target to $16 from $23, maintained its outperform rating, saying it believes Traeger's guidance \"will prove prudently conservative,\" and that the company is \"better situated to drive its multi-year top-line trajectory with now-lowered expectations.\" \n\n  Traeger shares were recently changing hands at $7.65, down about 13%, after falling to $6.82--the lowest level since the company went public last July--earlier in the session. The stock is down more than 75% from its all-time high of $32.59 reached in August. \n\n \n\n  Write to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 24, 2022 11:06 ET (15:06 GMT)\n",

         "Ecolab Sees 2Q Adjusted EPS Roughly Flat, 2022 Adjusted EPS Up \n\n\n\n \n\n  By Rob Curran \n\n \n\n  Ecolab Inc. forecast second-quarter operating earnings \"approaching\" year-earlier levels and growth in 2022 profit as it manages the effect of surging raw-material and energy costs by increasing prices and passing on an energy surcharge to customers. \n\n  The St. Paul, Minn., provider of water, hygiene and infection-prevention products and services forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings approaching the $1.22 a share level from the prior-year period. \n\n  For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings-per share growth in the low teens, based on the timing of the energy surcharge, which it is currently rolling out. The company said the temporary energy surcharge, intended to offset the increase in energy costs due to war in Ukraine, would be up to 12%, which it expects to \"develop progressively through the year.\" The effects of the surcharge would become clearer as it exits the second quarter, the company said. \n\n  \"While we expect the impact of substantial raw material and cost inflation to increase further in the second quarter and remain high for the balance of the year, we are also very pleased with our progress on pricing, and now expect it to be in the 6% to 7% range for the balance of the year,\" said President and Chief Executive Christophe Beck. \n\n \n\n  Write to Rob Curran at rob.curran@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April 26, 2022 08:55 ET (12:55 GMT)\n",

         "College Endowments Post Biggest Investment Losses Since Financial Crisis -- Barrons.com \n\n\n\nBy Mary Romano \n\n     University endowments posted their worst annual performance since the global financial crisis, battered by stock market losses, rising inflation, and higher interest rates. \n\n     Yet the biggest funds were helped by their higher allocations to alternative investments such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds. These investments, which offer a buffer against stock market losses but can be volatile, didn't lose as much ground even as their valuations declined with the market. Fund managers and industry experts warn, though, that further declines in these investments will contribute to any endowment losses in fiscal 2023. \n\n     Yale University's $41.4 billion fund, which had targeted just 2.3% for public equities and 47% to alternative investments such as venture capital and hedge funds, gained 0.8% in fiscal 2022. \n\n     \"In such a volatile year for the world's financial markets, we are pleased to have protected Yale's capital,\" Yale Chief Investment Officer Matt Mendelsohn said in a statement. \"That said, we expect challenging times ahead as rising interest rates, inflation and the geopolitical environment provide stiff headwinds.\" \n\n     School funds lost a median 7.8% in the 12 months through June 30, according to preliminary figures from investment firm Cambridge Associates. That is the worst showing since 2009, when the decline was a median 19%. The last time endowments saw investment losses was in 2016, when they slumped 1.95% on average, according to TIAA and the National Association of College and University Business Officers. \n\n     Despite the losses, endowments held up better in the same 2022 period than the S&P 500's loss of 10.6% with reinvested dividends. \n\n     \"The losses are coming from public equities, no question,\" Margaret Chen, global head of the endowment and foundation practice at Cambridge Associates, says of the 2022 performance. \"The higher the exposure, the more challenging the return for the fiscal year. The higher the private investments, the better your return on a relative basis.\" \n\n     Endowments with more than $1 billion had about 48% of their holdings in investments including private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds, and just 9.9% in U.S. equities as of fiscal 2021, the latest figures available, according to TIAA and NACUBO. Smaller funds -- $251 million to $500 million in assets -- had 26.1% in private investments and 25.2% in U.S. stocks. \n\n     The turnaround in performance follows a blockbuster fiscal 2021. Endowments gained 30.6%, on average, in the 12 months through June 30, 2021, according to TIAA and NACUBO. For instance, Duke University's endowment had an investment loss of 1.5% for fiscal 2022, compared with a 55.9% gain in the prior year. \n\n     \"It was a dramatic swing in performance from the last fiscal year to this fiscal year, and it's challenging to manage through that,\" Chen says. \n\n     Harvard on Thursday said its $50.9 billion fund lost 1.8%. The fund's strongest performers were its investments in private equity and venture capital, said Narv Narvekar, CEO of Harvard Management Company, which manages the endowment. \n\n     \"The more private assets an investor had in its portfolio in FY22, the stronger their performance,\" Narvekar wrote in Harvard's annual report. \"This is somewhat counterintuitive and may indicate that private managers have not yet marked their portfolios to reflect general market conditions.\" \n\n     He added that \"we expect that the end of the current calendar year might present meaningful adjustments to these valuations, as investment managers audit their portfolios.\" \n\n     Such markdowns are already happening, Chen says. \n\n     \"We are seeing them being marked down as the market declines further,\" Chen says. \"Fiscal 2023 will be more indicative of how things are marked down since there's always a lag because of the reporting methodology.\" \n\n     Write to editors@barrons.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 13, 2022 13:03 ET (17:03 GMT)\n",

       "Administration Sued On Drilling Permits -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Katy Stech Ferek \\n\\n     Environmental groups sued the Biden administration on Wednesday, saying that its decision to approve more than 3,500 oil and natural-gas drilling permits in New Mexico and Wyoming violated environmental laws by not taking into account the impact on climate change. \\n\\n     In their lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the conservation nonprofits Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians say the approved oil and gas wells will release as much as 600 million metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions, worsening climate change and damaging U.S. ecosystems. \\n\\n     The federal permitting agency \"has admitted that continued oil and gas exploitation is a significant cause of the climate crisis, yet the agency continues to recklessly issue thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits,\" said Kyle Tisdel, climate and energy program director with the Western Environmental Law Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the nonprofits. \\n\\n     \"While President Biden has acknowledged the urgency of this crisis, it is time for action to align with rhetoric,\" he said. \\n\\n     Specifically, the groups said that the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which handles oil and gas drilling on federal lands, violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to account for how approving the permits would affect the climate and nearby communities. They also said Bureau of Land Management officials failed to prevent \"unnecessary and undue degradation of public lands,\" a requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. \\n\\n     Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz declined to comment on the lawsuit. \\n\\n     The lawsuit is unlikely to have an immediate effect on U.S. energy prices. While the groups asked a judge to declare the permits to be unlawfully granted and to invalidate them, they didn't ask the court to immediately stop drilling-related activity under the permits. \\n\\n     Roughly 10% of U.S. oil and gas production comes from federal land. Most comes from state and private land. Additionally, federal actions taken on oil and gas drilling development are likely to take months, if not years, to affect U.S. production that could add to supply. \\n\\n     Since prices began to rise, the Biden administration encouraged drilling companies to increase production and said they could do so using some of the 9,000 approved-but-unused permits. \\n\\n     The encouragement has frustrated climate groups that said Mr. Biden is violating a campaign-trail promise to end oil and gas drilling on federal lands. Mr. Biden ordered a moratorium on new leases on the day he took office pending a federal report on the leasing program, which came out in November. Before the report, the moratorium was put on hold by a federal-district court judge in Louisiana. In April, Interior officials announced new lease sales for oil and gas drilling. \\n\\n     The lawsuit also said federal officials ignored how more greenhouse-gas pollution would harm climate-imperiled plants and animals, violating the Endangered Species Act. It identified about 150 species \"for which climate change is a primary driver of their decline,\" including Hawaiian songbirds, polar bears and coral reefs. \\n\\n     \"Fossil fuels are driving the extinction crisis, and the Bureau of Land Management is making things worse by failing to protect these imperiled species,\" said Brett Hartl, government-affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \\n\\n     Write to Katy Stech Ferek at katherine.stech@wsj.com \\n\\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 16, 2022). \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  June 16, 2022 02:33 ET (06:33 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3\n",
       "Higher Rates Will Put the Kibosh on Consumption Growth -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Justin Lahart \\n\\n \\n\\n     If you think inflation is cutting into Americans' spending, just wait to see what higher rates will do. \\n\\n     The Commerce Department on Friday reported that consumer spending rose 0.4% in August from July, after slipping 0.2% the previous month. However, the Commerce Department's measure of consumer prices, which also happens to be the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, also rose 0.3% in August. So real, or inflation-adjusted spending was up just 0.1%. \\n\\n     But durable-goods spending is also sensitive to higher rates. This is true of big-ticket items that people borrow to buy, such as cars, and it is also true of items that people buy to fill their newly purchased homes. Spending on furnishings and durable household equipment fell 0.9% in August from July. \\n\\n     Still, with the average level of real consumer expenditures higher in July and August than in the second quarter, it looks as if spending is on course for an eighth-straight quarter of gains. Given the interest-rate backdrop, however, a ninth could be a stretch. \\n\\n     There was nothing in Friday's report to give pause to the Fed's plans to keep pushing rates higher. To the contrary, core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy items in an effort to better track inflation's trend, jumped 0.6% from a month earlier and were 4.9% higher than a year earlier. Futures market implied odds of Fed policy makers raising rates by another three-quarters of a point at their meeting in early November, rather than a half point, increased after Friday's report. \\n\\n     On the other hand, by the time of the Fed meeting, higher rates could be taking a significant bite out of spending. Indeed, that might have already started to happen. \\n\\n     Friday's report showed that spending on durable goods -- long-lasting items such as cars and toasters -- slipped 0.4% in August from July. Some of that can be chalked up to a continuing shift in spending away the stay-at-home categories that surged after the pandemic hit. In a reflection of more people returning to activities such as travel, services spending rose 0.3%. \\n\\n     And of course rates are much higher now. Freddie Mac reported this week that the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage hit a 15 year high of 6.7%, which compares with an average level of 5.2% in August. People's ability to afford a home has become severely constrained, and with that the market for household appliances and the like is probably shrinking dramatically. \\n\\n     Spending has kept up remarkably well so far, but if the Fed keeps pumping the brakes, that isn't going to last. \\n\\n     Write to Justin Lahart at Justin.Lahart@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  September 30, 2022 11:20 ET (15:20 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3\n",

On coal, the company has guided for a higher price discount to the benchmark and higher costs. However, Glencore has also increased the benchmark Newcastle price forecast for the first half and this is $30 a ton better than RBC expected, Broda says. As for the marketing unit, the company said first half EBIT will exceed $3.2 billion, which is well ahead of the $1.9 billion consensus. \"We continue to expect that Glencore's ability to return cash is unsurpassed in the sector and the company remains structurally better positioned than peers through an economic downturn with coal tightness helping to insulate profitability,\" Broda says.

For BHP, the asset is only a small part of its portfolio, O'Connor notes. Still, exiting thermal coal was intended to be more than symbolic, reflecting a pivot in BHP's focus to commodities needed for the energy transition, he says.

They expect the South Korean steel maker's operating profit to hit a near quarterly record of KRW783 billion in 2Q and then weaken gradually. China's increasing steel output could also lead to lower steel prices, while rising iron-ore and coking-coal prices could weigh on earnings, they add.

Friday after the fabric and craft retailer posted disappointing quarterly results amid soaring inflation and supply-chain disruptions. \\n\\n  The Hudson, Ohio, chain posted an adjusted loss of 22 cents a share and a 13% drop in sales to $498 million for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30. \\n\\n  Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting an adjusted profit of 5 cents a share on sales of $524.5 million. \\n\\n  Comparable sales fell 13%, marking a fourth straight quarterly decline. \\n\\n  Following the report, analysts at Wells Fargo halved their price target on Joann shares to $5 from $10, saying they don't expect the negative business trajectory to improve this year. \\n\\n  Wells Fargo, which has an equal-weight recommendation on Joann shares, said it sees limited upside amid a volatile and unforgiving retail backdrop. \\n\\n  The analysts said that supply-chain and inflationary challenges remain and visibility is low, and that Joann's retail category is China-dependent, highly promotional and increasingly subject to rising cost pressures that don't appear to be letting up. \\n\\n  Analysts at Bank of America, meanwhile, lowered their stance on the stock to neutral from buy and slashed their price target to $8 from $20. \\n\\n  Joann shares were recently changing hands at $6.56, down nearly 17%, after falling to $6.48--the lowest level since the company returned to the public markets in March 2021--early in the session. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  June 03,

       "Stock Futures Jump After Inflation Data -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Akane Otani, Joe Wallace and Caitlin Ostroff \\n\\n \\n\\n     U.S. stock futures jumped after data showed inflation was weaker than expected in October. \\n\\n     Futures for the S&P 500 added 3.2% Thursday, while futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 soared 4.1% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 2.6%. Changes in futures don't necessarily reflect moves after the opening bell. \\n\\n     For much of 2022, data on consumer price increases has been bad news for markets. Inflation has proved stickier than many economists anticipated. That has forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at the fastest pace in decades, causing bond yields to soar and the stock market to slump. \\n\\n     But Thursday's report from the Labor Department offered some rare relief to investors. The core consumer-price index -- which excludes volatile energy and food prices -- rose 6.3% in October from a year earlier, less than the 6.5% increase economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had expected and down from a 40-year high in September. \\n\\n     The Fed, which raised rates by 0.75 percentage point last week, has said the size of future hikes will depend on the degree to which inflation slows. \\n\\n     \"The market is on thin ice already,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, ahead of the release of the data. \"But I can see a window where the market gets this kind of second false dawn, like we saw over the summer, where it gets excited about a peak Fed and peak inflation narrative.\" \\n\\n     Mr. Redha is still bracing for further declines in stock prices in the coming months because he thinks tighter monetary policy will help push the U.S. economy into recession in 2023. \\n\\n     Bonds rallied following the release of the data. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 3.932% from 4.149% Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. \\n\\n     Cryptocurrencies jumped, too. Bitcoin rose to $17,199 after slumping Wednesday. \\n\\n     The fall from grace of FTX, previously one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has rippled across the digital currency and token markets. Crypto exchange Binance reversed course on a rescue offer for FTX Wednesday, leaving the firm with an uncertain future. \\n\\n     Overseas, markets were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1%. \\n\\n     In politics, control of the Senate remained up for grabs, with contests in critical states too early to call and Georgia headed to a runoff. \\n\\n     Mr. Redha of PineBridge said investors might cheer a return to divided government in the near term. But he said it could make it harder for lawmakers to respond to a potential recession next year. \\n\\n     Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  November 10, 2022 08:55 ET (13:55 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3\n",

       "Inflation&apos;s Mild Reappearance -- Barrons.com \\n\\n\\n\\nEdited by Paul Farrell \\n\\n     Inflation Returns, Mildly \\n\\n     Economic Update by Regions Financial April 11: After having been oddly muted, inflation found its voice in March. But rather than a roar, it came back with more of a polite whisper. The total consumer price index fell by 0.1% in March, matching our forecast (the consensus was for no change), with core CPI rising by 0.2%, matching the consensus and ahead of our forecast of a 0.1% increase. It is the over-the-year comparisons, however, that were the focus ahead of today's release. It is the base effects [from the corresponding period of the prior year] -- including the precipitous decline in prices for cellphone service, beginning last March -- that made the over-the-year increases in both the headline and the core CPI look much worse in the March data. While energy prices muted the over-the-year change in the headline CPI, up 2.4%, those base effects were more pronounced in the core CPI, which stands 2.1% higher year-on-year compared with 1.8% higher in February. These over-the-year increases were smaller than many had feared. To which we'll say, just wait a month, as those changes will become more pronounced, beginning with the April data. So, even if inflation itself isn't screaming at us a month from now, the headlines atop the stories about inflation surely will be. \\n\\n     Retail gasoline prices were flat on a monthly average basis in March, contrary to the sizable increase for which the seasonal adjustment factors were geared. As a result, the seasonally adjusted gas prices were down 4.9%, month on month, which cut 0.2 of a percentage point off the change in the headline CPI. (This cut will disappear in the April data.) \\n\\n     The reaction in the financial markets to the March inflation data has leaned more toward indifference than fear, and we suspect the reaction within the Federal Open Market Committee will be much the same. The base effects in the inflation data are no surprise, or at least shouldn't be, and discounting the noise from gasoline prices, virtually everyone, the FOMC included, expects inflation to pick up. To the extent that the pickup remains orderly, it won't alter the FOMC's view of the appropriate path of monetary policy. -- Richard F. Moody \\n\\n     Consumers Flinch, But Are Basically Optimistic \\n\\n     Commentary and Analysis by Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. April 12: The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for April was preliminarily reported to have declined to 97.8 from a final March reading of 101.4. The April result compared to a median forecast of 100.4, and, while lower than the March outcome (which was the best since 2004), is nonetheless very strong in absolute terms. The decline in April was attributed by the University of Michigan mostly to concerns about a possible trade war, and these worries were heavily skewed by political party, just as the overall expectations of the index have been. \\n\\n     Earlier outcomes were 99.7 in February, 95.7 in January, 95.9 in December, 98.5 in November, 100.7 in October (previously the best reading since 2004), 95.1 in September, 96.8 in August, 93.4 in July, 95.1 in June, 97.1 in May, 97.0 in April, 96.9 in March, 96.3 in February, and 98.5 in January, 98.2 in December, 93.8 in November, and 87.2 in October of 2016. \\n\\n     This measure, along with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, is at a robust level, indicating overall consumer attitudes remain very positive. --Joshua Shapiro \\n\\n     To be considered for this section, material, with the author's name and address, should be sent to MarketWatch@barrons.com. \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  April 13, 2018 15:33 ET (19:33 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         3\n",
       "Commodities Corner: U.S. Shale Threatens OPEC -- Barron&apos;s \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Myra P. Saefong \\n\\n     Oil is among the biggest commodity gainers in 2019, with prices up by more than 20% -- a testament to the success of the output cuts agreed to by major crude producers at the start of the year. \\n\\n     However, the cuts may run head-on into the effects of increased U.S. shale production and more output from other sources. That could test the resolve of some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as their nonmember allies, which include Russia. \"High compliance with the OPEC production cuts is impressive and clearly a significant driver of the rally in crude oil futures,\" says Marshall Steeves, energy markets analyst at Informa Economics. But outside of Gulf producers like Saudi Arabia, compliance with output reductions \"may not necessarily remain high over time,\" he says. \\n\\n     OPEC members agreed to trim 800,000 barrels a day from October's production levels for six months through June 2019, with Russia and allied producers cutting 400,000 barrels more a day, for 1.2 million barrels in total cuts. \\n\\n     Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih recently told Reuters that it would be too early to change that pact before OPEC and its allies meet in June. The next official OPEC and non-OPEC meetings will be held on April 17 and 18. The Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which monitors compliance with output cuts, will hold its next gathering on Monday, March 18. \\n\\n     The 11 OPEC members achieved 79% of their committed cuts in February, with OPEC's production at 30.8 million barrels a day, according to a S&P Global Platts survey. That's an improvement from the 76% compliance rate a month earlier. Year to date as of Friday, U.S. oil futures have rallied by 29%, while global prices climbed more than 25%, after dropping by 20% or more in 2018. \\n\\n     The commitment to cuts is surprising given OPEC concerns over loss of market share to producers such as the U.S. U.S. crude production hit a record above 12 million barrels a day in recent weeks, and the International Energy Agency expects the U.S. to lead the rise in global oil production over the next five years. The IEA projection \"suggests the current trend of unconventional shale-production and offshore Gulf of Mexico production growth will likely continue at the expense of OPEC and allied producers,\" says Steeves. \"If OPEC and its allies want to keep oil prices high, they will need to curtail supplies, meaning they will continue to lose market share to the U.S. and others.\" \\n\\n     Not everyone is convinced shale production will grow at a significant pace. \"While I do see U.S. production growing, shale is expensive,\" says Matt Badiali, a senior research analyst at Banyan Hill Publishing. \"Operators can exist at $50 to $55 per barrel, but they aren't making much money -- and they need credit to operate. So as interest rates rise, it will likely slow U.S. production growth.\" \\n\\n     For now, oil prices \"have found a balance that could eventually prove precarious,\" with OPEC-led production cuts supporting higher prices, but increased output from the U.S. and elsewhere \"keeping a lid on the market,\" Steeves says. \\n\\n     He expects U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to trade in the mid-to-upper $50s in the next 30 to 60 days, with a wider range of $48 to $68 a barrel, while Brent trades in the upper $60s, within a wider range of $50 to $70. \\n\\n     \"What could break the impasse amounts to either a quick rebalancing of global markets that could raise prices or signs of slower global economic growth that could lead to lower oil prices,\" says Steeves. \\n\\n     Myra P.

       "Eurozone Inflation Jumped in November But Seen Slowing Down in 2022 -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     1054 GMT - Eurozone inflation rose by 4.9% year-on-year in November, driven mainly by higher energy prices, even when all components saw marked accelerations, Oxford Economics says. There isn't much the European Central Bank can do about higher energy prices and supply bottlenecks in the short-term, but the latest data will add to the debate on the appropriate level of policy support, Oxford Economics' economist Katharina Koenz says. Oxford Economics still expects energy and goods price pressures to ease next year thanks to supply constraints fading. Therefore, the economic research group sticks to its view that inflation will slow meaningfully over the course of 2022.

       "Natural Gas Prices Hit February High on Cold Weather \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n   By Dan Molinski \\n \\n\\n  --Natural-gas prices rose to their highest level of the month on Monday as continued cold weather keeps demand relatively elevated with spring less than a month away. \\n\\n  --Natural gas for March delivery ended 4.4% higher at $2.8360 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Monday's gains marked the third straight session of increases and the highest closing level since Jan. 30. \\n\\n \\nHIGHLIGHTS \\n \\n\\n  Weather: Prices rose Monday as weather forecasts continue to erase any hopes for an early spring. \"A cold shot sweeping across the Ohio Valley and Northeast Monday and Tuesday will give a bump in demand,\" said NatGasWeather.com, whose seven-day outlook released Monday calls for \"moderate\" national demand. \\n\\n  Storage: Adding price-support was weekly data Thursday from the Energy Information Administration showing inventories fell by a larger-than-expected 177 billion cubic feet last week. The weekly change put total storage at 1.705 trillion cubic feet, 4% below storage levels one year ago and 18% below the five-year average for this time of year. \\n\\n  LNG Demand: Global demand for liquefied natural gas surged last year, boosted by a growing appetite for cleaner-burning energy sources in Asia, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA.LN) said Monday. In its third annual LNG outlook report, the British-Dutch oil giant said global demand rose by 27 million tons to 319 million tons in 2018. \\n\\n \\nAHEAD \\n \\n\\n  --The EIA releases its next weekly report on gas storage on Thursday. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Christopher Alessi contributed to this report. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Dan Molinski at dan.molinski@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones

       "New Zealand CPI Reinforces Outlook for RBNZ Rate Increases -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     2335 GMT - New Zealand's 1Q inflation rate of 6.9% supports expectations for a series of RBNZ interest rate increases over the coming months, says Westpac economist Satish Ranchhod. The outcome was a little softer than the market consensus, but higher than RBNZ's forecast from February. \"Price pressures are bubbling over in every corner of the economy,\" says Ranchhod. It means the RBNZ--which raised its cash rate by 50 bps to 1.5% last week--will follow up with another 50 bp increase in May and 25 bp increases at subsequent meetings, he says.

       "Wheat Rally Continues as Russia Proposes Export Restrictions -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     1442 GMT - Wheat prices continue to rise, pushed higher by the supply constraints and rising demand. Milling-wheat futures are up 1.2% at EUR197 a metric ton in Paris, while U.S. wheat futures are 1.3% higher at $5.79 a bushel in Chicago. The wheat rally stands out because the virus-induced economic downturn is pushing many other commodity markets lower. Among the factors pushing wheat prices higher is a proposal by Russia's Agriculture Ministry to limit grain shipments for three months. Russia has emerged as the world's biggest wheat exporter in recent years. In the 2018-19 season it exported 35.8 million metric tons of wheat, ahead of the U.S. on 25.5 million tons, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

       "Press Release: Garage Door Service &amp; Repair Inc. Explains the Paradox of High Demand and Low Supply \\n\\n\\n\\n  Due to the world shipping crises, there was a shortage in parts & prices increased in the garage door industry, leaving consumers dissatisfied. The problem is explained by Garage Door Service & Repair inc. \\n\\n  HOUSTON, Nov. 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global supply chain crisis due to Covid-19 has seriously affected the garage door repair https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u09HCteovGamM7n3LQpHV7D-y79Aux07OqdjBSC-7GkPzOK4lMDSQp4dy-TmkSHqXUAXu9XaAOibb0EWUNv4qg== industry, caused huge delays and pushed the prices up, to the full disappointment and frustration of the customers. Garage Door Service & Repair Inc. explains that since the beginning of the pandemic, people started investing in various home improvements but the supply is slow and the parts are expensive. \\n\\n  \"Due to Covid-19, we've seen many shutdowns and operations suspended,\" says Thomas Wang, the CEO of Garage Door Service & Repair Inc. \"We've heard of people laid off and many quarantined. Health comes before anything else and so, we all took measures. The entire supply chain is shaking. There are not enough garage door parts. If we cannot deliver, customers cannot get.\" \\n\\n  The struggles of the global supply chain affected all local garage door companies https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x2KcVW0zQQZ_gmHM4bpyQsUXS4WmQM8DDcMTkh06Sk1E57T8l-_dBvJ-YOYx70AGFvGrtKVDx8EMqZEKz6vzkvcf3MLxHaLWz3Ab9gAHispfv1Xh9hy6rawrZFJnTyh7 . Many industries are involved in the manufacturing of aluminum, glass, and wooden products - anything from garage doors to springs. With the pandemic slowing or suspending businesses, the delays are unavoidable. The prices went up in the steel and wood industries - just to name two. Consequently, the garage door prices went up too. \\n\\n  \"People in the market for new garage door cables or springs because theirs are old or broken have a difficult time finding replacements. And they believe it's our fault. Naturally, we totally relate to them and stand by their side, but we must say it's not the fault of the companies. It's not just that there's a shortage of garage door parts but also problems in the shipping industry. Since the prices went up, even those who get garage door spring replacements, for example, have to pay double the price and wait double the time.\" \\n\\n  The paradox is that due to Covid, people invest in home improvements, replacing and repairing their garage door. \"This is the problem,\" said Wang. \"Due to Covid, many people work at home and invest back in their home. We get many orders but since there's a problem with the supply chain, there's delay. The more the delay, the more orders pile up, causing extra delay. And when, finally, people get their garage doors, sometimes, parts are missing.\" \\n\\n  Find out more about the garage door company at https://www.gds-repair.com \\n\\n  About Garage Door Service & Repair Inc \\n\\n  Garage Door Service & Repair Inc is a professional company, specializing in all services and serving the Houston, TX, metro.

       "BOF Governor Says Europe Should Avoid a Recession This Year -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Noemie Bisserbe \\n\\n \\n\\n  Europe should avoid a recession this year despite high inflation and economic uncertainty, Bank of France Governor François Villeroy de Galhau told a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. \\n\\n  The war in Ukraine and Western sanctions against Russia have taken a heavy toll on the European economy, disrupting trade and driving up inflation. \\n\\n  \"We have a slowdown without any doubt,\" Mr. Villeroy de Galhau said. \"But activity is more resilient than what we expected three months ago,\" he added. \\n\\n  The Bank of France chief said he expects inflation to peak during the first half of this year in Europe, before it starts easing later this year. \\n\\n  Inflation in the eurozone stood at 9.2% in December 2022, down from 10.1% in November. \\n\\n  \"We will win, at the end of the day, the battle against inflation, have no doubt about that, I take this commitment on behalf of the ECB,\" said Mr. Villeroy de Galhau, who is also a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council. \"We will bring inflation back towards 2% by the end of 2024 or 2025, but this battle is not yet won,\" he added. \\n\\n  Mr. Villeroy de Galhau said the resilience of the continent's economy would make ramping up interest rates less complicated. \\n\\n \\n\\n  This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, held its annual U.S. Retirement Market Outlook press briefing yesterday, offering research-based insights on major themes expected to shape the retirement landscape in 2023. Amid economic factors such as inflation, the risk of recession, volatile markets, and rising interest rates, a select panel of the firm's experts shared their perspectives on key topics, including the impact of under--saving and its contribution to the retirement savings gap, the need to help Americans navigate a complex set of retirement and other financial challenges, and the impact of the current investment market environment on retirement. \\n\\n  The panel discussion featured commentary from Kim DeDominicis, target date portfolio manager; Michael Doshier, senior retirement strategist; Jessica Sclafani, senior defined contribution strategist; and Rachel Weker, senior retirement strategist.

       "Helen Of Troy Stock Falls After Earnings Beat Expectations But Full-year Outlook Due To Inflation Impact On Spending -- MarketWatch \\n\\n\\n\\n  Shares of Helen of Troy Ltd.  fell 1.5% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the consumer products company, with brands including OXO, Hydro Flask and Braun, reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations but cut its full-year outlook, as rising inflation has prompted consumers to change their spending patterns. Net income for the quarter to Aug. 31 fell to $30.7 million, or $1.28 a share, from $51.3 million, or $2.11 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $2.27 beat the FactSet consensus of $2.19. Sales grew 9.7% to $521.4 million, above the FactSet consensus of $519.1 million, as growth in home and outdoor and health and wellness sales offset a drop in beauty sales. In addition to inflation impacting spending patterns, Chief Executive Julien Mininbert said retailers continue to adjust inventories to be better aligned with updated sales forecasts. \"We expect the current external operating environment to remain highly challenging, causing us to lower our fiscal year 2023 outlook,\" Mininberg said. For fiscal 2023, the company cut its guidance ranges for adjusted EPS to $9.00 to $9.40 from $9.85 to $10.35 and for sales to $2.00 billion to $2.50 billion from $2.15 billion to $2.20 billion. The stock has tumbled 39.2% over the past three months through Tuesday while the S&P 500  has slipped 1.1%. \\n\\n  -Tomi Kilgore \\n\\n For more from MarketWatch:

       "RBA Remains Dovish Even as GDP Forecasts Revised Upward \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n   By James Glynn \\n \\n\\n  SYDNEY--The Reserve Bank of Australia remains committed to keeping interest rates near zero for another three years at least even as the economy surges back to life, bringing with it rapidly rising house prices and a fast-paced tightening of the job market. \\n\\n  At its monthly board meeting Tuesday, the RBA left its official cash rate at 0.10%, and held fast to a three-year government bond yield target at the same rate. \\n\\n  RBA Governor Philip Lowe continued to point to a long-term horizon for interest rate increases, saying that while the economy is recovering quickly, the conditions for an interest rate increase are still many years away. \\n\\n  \"The RBA will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2% to 3% target range. For this to occur, the labor market will need to be tight enough to generate wages growth that is materially higher than it is currently. This is unlikely to be until 2024 at the earliest,\" Mr. Lowe said in a statement accompanying the decision. \\n\\n  Mr. Lowe also announced upwardly-revised forecasts for GDP growth and lowered the central bank's expectations for unemployment. \\n\\n  The RBA now expects the economy to grow 4.75% in 2021, up from a forecast of 3.5% issued just three months ago. The unemployment rate is now expected to be at 5.0% by December, compared with a forecast in February of 6%. The jobless rate stood at 5.6% in March. \\n\\n  Still, recent CPI data confirmed that inflation pressures remain subdued in most parts of the Australian economy. Mr. Lowe said. \\n\\n  \"A pick-up in inflation and wages growth is expected, but it is likely to be only gradual and modest,\" Mr. Lowe said. \\n\\n  The RBA will announce a full set of economic forecasts on Friday in its quarterly statement on monetary policy. \\n\\n   Earlier Tuesday, the impact of record-low interest rates became more visible in data showing mortgage lending to property investors jumped in March. \\n\\n  New loan commitments for housing rose 5.5% in March, with lending to investors accounting for more than half of the rise. Data earlier this week showed house prices nationally growing at an annual rate of close to 20%. \\n\\n  While the recovery in the economy poses some challenges for the RBA in the medium term, it is nothing but good news for Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who will release the government's 2021-2022 budget on May 11. \\n\\n  With fewer people on government benefits and with iron ore prices at 10-year highs, the budget's bottom line is expected to be vastly improved from what was expected at the end of 2020. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to James Glynn at james.glynn@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  May 04, 2021 01:06 ET (05:06 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",

       "&apos;Moderate&apos; Recession In Offing For Canada -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     1527 ET - Oxford Economics says Canada is heading for a \"moderate\" recession, starting in 4Q, with an expected peak-to-trough decline in GDP of nearly 2%. The forecasting firm says the slump is mostly due to aggressive rate increases from the Bank of Canada--up 3 percentage points since the start of the year. Sharply higher interest rates will cause costs of servicing elevated household debt to rise, Oxford says, and a housing correction underway to deepen. External factors--slowdowns in Europe and US--are also playing a role. Oxford anticipates BOC's main policy interest rate to peak at 3.75%, or 50 basis points higher than present level, as the central bank tries to pull annual inflation down from 7% to its preferred 2% target.

       "Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Cuts Key Rate, Signals It Will Stand Pat Next Meeting -- Update \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Paulo Trevisani and Jeffrey T. Lewis \\n\\n     BRASÍLIA -- Brazil's central bank trimmed its benchmark lending rate to a record low Wednesday amid volatility in world stock markets and growing concern about rising global inflation. \\n\\n     The bank's monetary-policy committee cut its benchmark Selic rate to 6.75%, from 7%, and indicated it would hold the Selic at that level at its next meeting. \\n\\n     \"Provided the committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, at this time the [committee] views the interruption of the monetary easing process as more appropriate,\" the bank said in its note announcing the cut, adding that even with recent market volatility, conditions are favorable for the Brazilian economy. \\n\\n     The inflation rate in Brazil remains below the central bank's 3% to 6% target range, at 2.9% in January, while unemployment remains high and the economy is just starting to recover from a two-year recession. That combination should permit the central bank to leave the Selic where it stands for months to come, analysts said. \\n\\n     Brazil's economic output is projected to have expanded 1% in 2017, and forecasts for 2018 are around 3%, a mark last hit in 2013. Joblessness is at 11.8%, but it has been declining for nine months, from a peak of 13.7% in March 2017. \\n\\n     \"With the economy picking up, inflation will rise in the next few months, \" so it makes sense to stop cutting rates, said Mauro Calil, an economist at Ourinvest bank. \\n\\n     Declining borrowing costs are already boosting the recovery, as companies use cheaper money to beef up their business. \\n\\n     \"A few years ago, companies just closed the spigots on new investment. In the past few months, they've started reopening them,\" said Thiago Rocha, director of mergers and acquisitions for Senior Solution, a São Paulo-based financial software and services provider. He said even acquisitions are easier now. \\n\\n     \"Lower interest rates mean I can make better offers\" to buy companies, he said. \\n\\n     But the Brazilian government's gaping budget hole and shifting global forces could shorten the low-rate period, economists say. \\n\\n     The central bank's fight against inflation has benefited from years of near-zero interest rates in the developed world, as investors sought fatter yields in emerging markets and foreign investment supported the local currency, driving prices of imported goods lower. \\n\\n     Economists say this could change if the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks speed up the pace of rate increases, a possibility reinforced last week by stronger-than-expected job growth in the U.S. \\n\\n     \"When rates go up in the U.S., there is less money flowing to emerging markets,\" said Tony Volpon, chief economist at UBS in Brazil and a former central-bank deputy governor. \"It's a historic relation.\" \\n\\n     Mr. Volpon said, however, that if the Fed sticks to its forecast of three rate increases this year, a selloff of Brazilian assets would be unlikely. \\n\\n     But the risk is worsened by troubled government finances. Brazil ended 2017 with a budget deficit equal to 7.8% of gross domestic product, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 74%, both levels economists considered too high for an emerging market and a source of inflation. \\n\\n     \"The fiscal fragility is enormous,\" Mr. Volpon said. \"It's a mega-hole that markets have been financing.\" He added that financing could become more expensive if global investors ran away from emerging markets. \\n\\n     Write to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com and Jeffrey T.

       "Selloff in Eurozone Govt Bonds Gains Momentum After German CPI Data -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     1325 GMT - Selloff in eurozone government bonds accelerates after Germany's preliminary inflation comes in at a higher level than expected by economists for December. Germany's annual rate of inflation was 5.3% last month, measured by national standards, and it was 5.7% measured by European Union-harmonized standards, with both being higher than forecast in The Wall Street Journal's poll of economists. Eurozone government bonds have been selling off on Thursday, tracking U.S. Treasury yields higher following the FOMC's minutes released on Wednesday. The 10-year German Bund yield is trading 3.5 basis points higher at -0.093%, according to Tradeweb. The selloff is led by Italy, with the 10-year BTP yield trading 5.3 basis points higher at 1.292%.

       "Improvement in US Consumer Sentiment Unlikely to Last Long -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     1538 GMT - U.S. consumers were slightly more optimistic in August as inflation moderated but sentiment among households remained subdued and is unlikely to improve significantly in the short term, Matthew Martin, U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, says in a note. \"Price pressures and economic uncertainty remain elevated, making any sustained rallies for sentiment unlikely,\" he says. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey also showed a retreat in households' inflation expectations for the year ahead to the lowest level in eight months, a reading that the Fed will welcome even as the data can be volatile, Martin says.

The 25-basis-point cut made then was the Southeast Asian nation's first since July 2016. \\n\\n  \"In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest,\" it said, adding that the trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Yi Wei Wong at yiwei.wong@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow

       "Wheat Leads Grain, Soybean Markets Lower \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n   By Benjamin Parkin \\n \\n\\n  Wheat futures fell to the lowest close in four weeks as uncertainty about Russia's wheat crop continued to weigh down prices. \\n\\n  Contracts for September delivery fell 2.8% to $5.27 1/4 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade, closing at the lowest point since July 24. \\n\\n  Traders attributed much of the selling to ongoing debate about the size of Russia's wheat crop and exports this year. Prices rallied last week on reports that Russia's agriculture ministry might curb exports as a result of a tougher growing season. \\n\\n  But a series of subsequent denials, along with updated estimates that suggested the country's grain crop was larger than expected, prompted traders to erase those gains. The agriculture ministry on Tuesday increased its 2018 production estimate to 100 to 105 million metric tons, traders said, up from 100 million. \\n\\n  Wheat prices rallied to the highest in years earlier this month as a heatwave in Europe and elsewhere fomented concern about global grain production. That buying interest has since waned. \\n\\n  Corn and soybean futures also fell on Tuesday. CBOT September soybeans slid 0.8% to $8.74 1/2 a bushel while September corn slid 0.6% to $3.59 3/4 a bushel. \\n\\n  Prices fell after crop scouts on the annual Pro Farmer Midwest crop tour found excellent corn and soybean conditions in Ohio and South Dakota on Monday, estimating bumper yields. \\n\\n  Early results from Tuesday's route through Indiana and Nebraska were more varied. Scouts found evidence of aborted corn kernels in Indiana, along with signs of heat and drought in southern Nebraska. \\n\\n  \"It's definitely had some stress,\" said Jeff Wilson, a market analyst at Pro Farmer and leader of the tour's western leg, referring to the corn crop. The day's final results are due on Tuesday night. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Benjamin Parkin at benjamin.parkin@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  August 21, 2018 15:01 ET (19:01 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
       "Supplier Prices Jumped in March, Keeping Upward Pressure on U.S. Inflation \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Gwynn Guilford \\n\\n  Suppliers raised prices sharply last month, a sign inflation continues to percolate through the U.S. economy. \\n\\n  The Labor Department on Wednesday said the producer-price index, which generally reflects supply conditions in the economy, increased a seasonally adjusted 1.4% in March from the prior month, a pickup from an upwardly revised 0.9% gain in February. \\n\\n  Producer prices rose 11.2% on a 12-month basis, compared with an upwardly revised 10.3% increase in February. That marked the fourth consecutive month with a double-digit gain and was the highest since records began in 2010. \\n\\n  The report comes a day after the government said consumer prices increased by 8.5% in March to a four-decade high, the Labor Department said Tuesday, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to speed up a series of interest-rate increases expected in May and June. \\n\\n  The so-called core price index--which excludes the often-volatile categories of food, energy and supplier margins--climbed 0.9% in March from a month earlier, after increasing 0.2% in February. \\n\\n

       "Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Hits New Record -- Market Talk \\n\\n\\n\\n     0855 GMT - Eurozone manufacturing is booming, reaching a new purchasing managers' index record set for the second consecutive month, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says. Eurozone manufacturing PMI rose to 62.9 in April from 62.5 in March. \"The past two months have seen output and order books both improve at rates unsurpassed since the survey began in 1997, with surging demand boosted by economies opening up from Covid-19 lockdowns and brightening prospects for the year ahead,\" Williamson says. However, supply constraints are also running at unprecedented levels. The consequence of demand running ahead of supply is higher prices charged by manufacturers, which are rising at the fastest rate ever recorded, Williamson says.

       "Inflation Data Will Put Stocks&apos; Recovery to the Test \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n  By Chelsey Dulaney \\n\\n  U.S. stocks, fresh off their worst week in two years, will be tested again this week by new data on U.S. inflation. \\n\\n  The Labor Department will release its monthly consumer-price index on Wednesday and its producer-price index for January a day later. The data indicate how fast prices for a variety of goods and services--from food to healthcare costs--are rising throughout the U.S. \\n\\n  As the The Wall Street Journal's  Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted Monday, the reports are likely to face heightened scrutiny after fears about rising U.S. inflation helped unleash a global stock rout last week. \\n\\n  Stronger-than-expected wage growth in monthly U.S. jobs data released at the start of the month sent government bond yields to their highest level since 2014, raising concerns among stock investors. U.S. indexes have shown signs of stabilizing after last week' rout, rallying into the closing bell Friday and on track to open higher on Monday. \\n\\n  Some investors believe stronger wage growth is a sign that inflation is beginning to firm after years of tepid growth. In theory, companies should be able to raise prices if consumers are earning more. \\n\\n  Higher inflation would ramp up pressure on the Federal Reserve to pick up the pace of interest-rate increases. Higher rates can pressure stocks by making it more expensive for companies to borrow and by reducing the attractiveness of stock dividends. \\n\\n  The more than 5% drop for U.S. stocks last week was attributed in part to concerns about rising rates, though some investors remain skeptical that the outlook for higher inflation has changed, saying one-off factors like weather drove January's stronger wage growth. \\n\\n  This week's data, which includes the price index for personal-consumption expenditures--the Fed's preferred inflation gauge--will offer clues on whether the uptick in wages is filtering through to broader measures of inflation. \\n\\n  \"Markets' worries about higher inflation and tighter monetary policy are overdone in our view,\" said analysts at Oxford Economics. \"Inflation will indeed firm gradually, but we don't see signs an imminent spiral out of control.\" \\n\\n  Evidence that inflation is sticking to its moderate pace of growth should help ease concerns over a dramatic shift in the economy and could help stocks to recover, analysts say. \\n\\n  But if those two readings come in hotter than expected, buckle up for another bumpy week for stocks. \\n\\n  To receive our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter via email,  click here. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  February 12, 2018 08:47 ET (13:47 GMT)\\n

       "UK Job Vacancies Hit Record High \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n  By Jason Douglas and David Hodari \\n\\n \\n\\n  LONDON--The number of job vacancies in the U.K. economy hit a record high last month, a sign that employers are struggling to fill posts amid a slowdown in the number of workers arriving in the country from elsewhere in the European Union. \\n\\n  The Office for National Statistics said Tuesday that there were 824,000 unfilled jobs in the U.K. in the three months through June, the highest number recorded since comparable records began in 2001. \\n\\n  The sectors showing the largest increase in vacancies were health care and transport, while the hospitality sector showed the largest number of unfilled posts overall. \\n\\n  The figures come after data Monday showed net migration from the EU--the number of people arriving minus the number leaving--fell to 101,000 in the 12 months through December, the lowest level in five years, as buoyant growth in the eurozone and uncertainty over the U.K.'s future ties to the bloc dented its appeal. \\n\\n  Tuesday's jobs report showed the labor market remains healthy despite a soft patch for growth at the start of the year and heightened political uncertainty surrounding Prime Minister Theresa May, who is struggling to unite factions of her ruling Conservative Party behind her strategy for exiting the EU. \\n\\n  The unemployment rate in the U.K. held steady at 4.2% in the three months through May, the ONS said, while the number of people in work rose to 32.4 million, a new record. \\n\\n  Annual wage growth slowed to 2.7% in the three months through May from 2.8% in the previous three months. Still, cooling inflation is boosting workers' buying power, and an increase in vacancies raises the prospect of faster wage growth in the months ahead as employers bid up pay to attract new staff. \\n\\n  The figures will likely cement expectations that the Bank of England is poised to lift interest rates next month. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Jason Douglas at Jason.Douglas@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  July 17, 2018 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2\n",

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading up 0.5% at $63.88 a barrel. \\n\\n  U.S. President Donald Trump is set to review whether to waive or reimpose sanctions on Iran this week, a decision that has implications on Iran's oil exports. \\n\\n  \"It will be very important for the oil market to see what he does with Iran considering that in the past sanctions regime a large portion of exports was disrupted,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Wealth Management. \\n\\n  Oil prices have been grinding higher and higher, spurring forecasters to predict they could hit $80 a barrel this year. \\n\\n  IN POLAND, U.S. SHALE BOOM DISPLACES IRAN AND RUSSIA OIL \\n\\n  For decades, the East European nation of Poland has largely relied on crude supplies from Russia, a powerful neighbor that's also the world's largest oil producer, writes Benoit Faucon. \\n\\n  But in 2016, Warsaw scooped up Iranian oil after nuclear sanctions against Tehran were lifted. Now Iran and Russia are facing a new rival in town: U.S. crude that's being sold abroad  after export restrictions were ended to take advantage of booming U.S. shale output. \\n\\n  A tanker of 1 million barrels is currently sailing from Houston on its way to Poland, according to shipping tracker Kpler, bringing American shipments to the European nation to 3.2 million barrels in the past three months. \\n\\n  NEW YORK CITY SUES OIL COMPANIES OVER CLIMATE CHANGE \\n\\n  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday his administration had filed a lawsuit against five major oil companies as part of an effort to fight climate change. The city filed the suit against oil companies BP PLC, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. \\n\\n  LONDON LOSES OIL FUTURES LISTINGS AS MIFID II BITES \\n\\n  Intercontinental Exchange plans to transfer trading in hundreds of energy futures contracts from London to the U.S., as customers seek to escape new Mifid II rules governing European financial markets,the Financial Times reports. \\n\\n  Rio Tinto Group has dropped out of the bidding for a stake in Soc.

       "Tyson Foods Says Rising Chicken Prices Fuel Higher Third-Quarter Sales -- Update \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Patrick Thomas and Dean Seal \\n\\n \\n\\n     Tyson Foods Inc. said raising chicken prices helped keep sales higher in its more recent quarter, but rising costs wiped out any profit growth. \\n\\n     Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat processor by sales, said its profit margins were hurt by consumers pulling back from spending on premium cuts of beef. The company said the average sales price for beef was 1.2% lower over the three months ended July 2 and was 3.9% lower for pork. \\n\\n     Chicken prices, meanwhile, surged 20% and 14% in its prepared foods business, which includes brands such as Jimmy Dean and Ball Park. However, the company's profit was flat from a year ago, amid rising costs for wages, animal feed and transportation, the company said. \\n\\n     For the past two years, meatpacking companies, including Tyson, had boasted historically high profit margins from their beef businesses. Meatpackers have said that because many of their processing plants remain short-staffed, they can't process as many cattle, constraining meat supplies and pushing prices higher while demand has stayed steady. \\n\\n     The Arkansas-based company said operating income from its beef unit was cut in half for the third quarter to $533 million from $1.12 billion the prior year. Falling demand for steaks sent prices down for beef for the quarter, the company said. \\n\\n     Operating income margins in Tyson's beef business fell to 10.7% in the most recent quarter, compared with nearly 23% in the same period a year ago. Sales volumes rose slightly in its beef business but were down in chicken and pork. Volumes of its prepared foods business fell nearly 9%, partly because of higher prices and the divestiture of its pet treats business a year ago. \\n\\n     The company is in the midst of revamping its chicken operations, a business it has long dominated, where it has been struggling to meet demand and staff its plants. \\n\\n     Demand for chicken has remained high, from supermarkets to fast-food chains battling over crispy chicken sandwiches. Consumers often trade down to chicken from pricier meat options, including beef.  For Tyson's chicken business, which produces roughly one-fifth of the U.S. supply, operating income improved to $277 million for the quarter, compared with a $279 million loss last year. \\n\\n     Tyson's chicken challenges range from hatching enough chicks to short-handed processing lines in the plants. The company has had to pay more for grain to feed its chickens and wages to keep plants staffed. To meet orders, Tyson has sometimes bought chicken from rival processors. \\n\\n     Tyson said net income for its third quarter was flat at $750 million compared with $749 million a year earlier, as lower beef margins weighed on the company's quarterly results. The company reported $13.50 billion in quarterly sales, compared with $12.48 billion a year earlier. \\n\\n     The company's sales results surpassed Wall Street analysts' expectations while its profit numbers fell short. The company posted an adjusted profit of $1.94 a share, lower than the $1.97 analysts polled by FactSet were expecting. Shares fell 3.4% to $84.50 in premarket trading. \\n\\n     Write to Patrick Thomas at patrick.thomas@wsj.com and Dean Seal at dean.seal@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  August 08, 2022 11:01 ET (15:01 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
       "Clearwater Paper Shares Higher After Earnings Beat \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n  By Michael Dabaie \\n\\n \\n\\n  Clearwater Paper Corp. shares were up 21%, to $33.21, in late morning trading Friday after quarterly results beat analyst views. \\n\\n  The supplier of tissue and bleached paperboard products after the bell Thursday said first-quarter sales rose 15%, to $488 million, beating FactSet consensus for $482 million. Adjusted EPS of $1.03 beat FactSet consensus of 87 cents. \\n\\n  Clearwater pointed to continued strength in the paperboard business and improvements in tissue and said higher pricing in both businesses helping to offset inflation. \\n\\n  \"Strong paperboard demand continued and prices increased. Tissue demand was stable while prices increased. Inflation continued to be a headwind across most of our input costs, particularly pulp, chemicals, energy and freight,\" Chief Executive Arsen Kitch said during the company's conference call. \"We continue to focus on offsetting inflation with price increases and better operating performance in both businesses.\" \\n\\n  \"As a result of our strong first quarter performance and our improved outlook for the year, we're now anticipating achieving our debt leverage target sooner than anticipated and are resuming our previously authorized share buyback program. The program has approximately $30 million remaining,\" Mr. Kitch said. \\n\\n  Chief Financial Officer Michael Murphy said the company sees second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $54 million to 64 million.

       "3M to Cut Costs as Business Cools Beyond Masks--Update \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Austen Hufford \\n\\n     3M Co., maker of coveted N95 face masks used by workers treating coronavirus patients, said sales grew in its medical business while a deepening industrial downturn is weighing on its business overall. \\n\\n     3M said Tuesday its adjusted sales in the Americas region fell 20% in April as factories suspended production, dentists cut back on operations and office managers bought fewer supplies for workforces at home. \\n\\n     The company withdrew its guidance for the year, citing uncertainty about the broader industrial economy. While the pandemic has sharply increased demand for some 3M products, most notably its face masks, the company said demand has fallen for other goods in its vast product line, like industrial glues, as factory closures ripple through the industrial economy. \\n\\n     \"We saw strong growth in personal safety, as well as in other areas of our portfolio experiencing high demand due to the pandemic,\" said Chief Executive Mike Roman. \"At the same time, we experienced weak demand in several end markets that were more severely impacted by actions taken around the world to slow the pandemic.\" \\n\\n     Shares in 3M rose 3.4% in premarket trading to $158.79, after revenue and profit for the first quarter came in above analyst expectations. \\n\\n     3M said it was cutting its capital investments this year to about $1.3 billion, down from as much as $1.8 billion planned previously. 3M also said it was furloughing some staff and temporarily shutting down some nonmask production lines due to weakened demand. \\n\\n     About 25% of the company's factories and warehouses were closed as of earlier this month, 3M said. The company expects the second quarter, which began in April, to be the weakest for the global economy. \\n\\n     3M has ramped up production of N95 masks, so-called because they block 95% of very small particles including those containing the virus. The company, based in St. Paul, Minn., has doubled global production to around 100 million a month and plans to double production again by early next year. 3M had $100 million in extra face-mask sales in its first quarter. \\n\\n     The increased production hasn't kept pace with the vast demand for the masks from front-line workers confronting the pandemic. The Trump administration in early April invoked the Defense Production Act to compel 3M to import 166.5 million masks from its facilities in China by the end of June. The Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services have also placed mask orders with 3M of nearly $250 million combined that will further increase domestic mask capacity. \\n\\n     Some hospitals have said they are turning to unknown resellers for masks they can't find through 3M's main distributors, such as W.W. Grainger Inc. \\n\\n     \"We received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we've usually received over several years, and in some cases even decades,\" Grainger's Chief Executive Donald Macpherson said last week. \\n\\n     3M has said it hasn't raised prices on its masks. The company has filed lawsuits against alleged price gougers and is working with authorities to clamp down on allegedly fraudulent behavior. \\n\\n     The maker of Post-it Notes also said that sales of office supplies decreased as many people began working from home. \\n\\n     Sales, excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, grew 0.3% in the first quarter. Revenue grew 2.7% to $8.08 billion in its first quarter. Profit rose 45% to $1.29 billion, or $2.22 a share, up from $891 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier.

The company posted an adjusted earnings per share of $2.16, above the $2.03 expected by analysts. \\n\\n     Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  April 28, 2020 08:24 ET (12:24 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
       "Base Metal Prices Slip But Medium-Term Fundamentals Remain Bullish -- Analysis \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n  By Yusuf Khan \\n\\n \\n\\n  Base metal prices have been sliding since the start of the third quarter on mounting recession concerns, but medium-term fundamentals point to higher prices toward the end of this year and into 2023, analysts say. \\n\\n  Copper prices have been sliding since the start of June, seeing a 21% fall from June 8 to Monday, while nickel prices have fallen 24% in the same period with aluminum also following a similar trend. \\n\\n  Much of these trends stem from global recession worries and a lack of demand for industrial goods. \\n\\n  Any concerns over growth tend to hit base metal prices as copper, for example, is considered a bellwether for the global economy given its use in construction. \\n\\n  However, long-term issues with supply and the possible restart of industrial production in China following Covid-19 lockdowns is likely to mean prices for base metals will rise or remain at a high level in the medium term. \\n\\n  \"Supply side issues can't be ignored,\" ANZ analysts Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said in a note. \"Mining headwinds associated with environmental, social and governance requirements are exacerbating labor shortages and high energy costs, stalling plans to boost the output of copper, aluminum and nickel,\" the analysts said, adding that this was on top of disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. \\n\\n  Fitch Solutions furthered this sentiment saying nickel prices in particular were likely to remain high because of disruptions in primary material supply from Russia, while refining rates were still lacking in China due to lockdowns. \\n\\n  \"In the short term, global production growth will also be constrained by Indonesia's ban on exports of nickel ore, which will limit deliveries of ore to nickel refineries in other countries, notably mainland China,\" Fitch said in a note. In terms of the primary side, copper production has been hampered by strikes in South America, as well as mining halts from indigenous protests. \\n\\n  Furthermore, exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange have seen sharp drawdowns in inventories for base metals, with ANZ noting aluminum, zinc and nickel are all at multiyear lows creating \"vulnerable to further tightness\". \\n\\n  \"Metals are trading macro sentiment [currently],\" Goldman Sachs analyst Nicholas Snowdon said in a note. \"Since China's mini-recession in April, prices across the metals complex have disassociated from fundamentals, with copper and aluminum down 20% and 30% respectively over the past quarter,\" he said. \\n\\n  \"Such behavior highlights to us the exceptional market conditions investors are facing today,\" Snowdon said. Current conditions have left traditional metal pricing models which focus on inventories, unit flow and cost curves as \"irrelevant in dictating short run price,\" he said. \\n\\n  But, in the longer run, \"China will likely break the bear market,\" Snowdon added. \\n\\n  China's economic activity is starting to recover from its strict lockdowns and metal intensive industries like automotive are seeing recovering sales already, the analyst said. \"Supportive monetary and green policies are set to fuel metals demand growth and offset continued property slowdown,\" Snowdon said. \\n\\n  Additionally, high energy prices will continue to constrain metals production with goods like zinc and aluminum highly energy intensive. A number of smelters have been forced into shutdowns this year because of spiraling costs. \\n\\n  In a separate note, Snowdon's colleague Sabine Schels said base metals were likely to see a resurgence in demand as soon as the third [current] quarter on Chinese economic stimulus, to help further support prices. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Yusuf Khan at yusuf.khan@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  July 11, 2022 08:03 ET (12:03 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",
       "Fed Releases Transcripts of 2016 Policy Meetings -- Update \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nick Timiraos \\n\\n     Transcripts released by the Federal Reserve on Friday revealed the extent of officials' 2016 debate over how fast to move up interest rates after lifting them from near zero at the end of the previous year. \\n\\n     Much of the discussion turned on geopolitical developments -- first as a slowdown in China and in commodity prices threatened to cool down the U.S. manufacturing sector and later after voters in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the European Union. \\n\\n     The Fed ended up raising its benchmark interest rate just once in 2016, in December, weeks after Donald Trump won the presidential election. \\n\\n     Hundreds of pages of transcripts of eight policy meetings in 2016, made public by the central bank after a traditional five-year lag, provide the most complete view of decision-making at the dawn of a transition to \"normalizing\" policy. \\n\\n     While the policy outcomes of the meetings were announced shortly after they ended, and minutes of the sessions summing them up were released three weeks later, the verbatim transcripts of the discussions weren't public until now. \\n\\n     The transcripts offered new insight into the thinking of several key players still on the policy-making scene, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who was then entering his fifth year as a governor, and then-Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who is now Treasury secretary. \\n\\n     They show officials grappling that December with how the election of Mr. Trump, who had campaigned on promises to revamp government spending, taxes and trade policy, would reshape the outlook for growth and inflation in the years ahead. \\n\\n     \"If the incoming administration changes economic policy in several areas as radically as promised during the election campaign, we will...have to develop an approach to making monetary policy in a setting of much greater\" uncertainty, said Stanley Fischer, then the Fed's vice chairman. \\n\\n     They also reveal officials' sense of humor at their hourslong policy deliberations. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard opened his discussion of the economy on Dec. 13, 2016, with a joke. \"According to some interpretations of the Book of Revelations, when three unusual events occur together, they may be a sign that the apocalypse is near. Let's take stock,\" he began. \"The Chicago Cubs have won the World Series, Donald Trump has won the presidency, and Bob Dylan has won a Nobel Prize.\" \\n\\n     The transcripts for the meeting show officials mused about how the election revealed broader frustrations with Americans who felt left behind in the economy. \\n\\n     Mr. Trump had criticized the Fed during the campaign when the Republican nominee, in September of that year, had sharply attacked Ms. Yellen, arguing that the central bank was holding rates down to help Democrats at the ballot box. \\n\\n     Mr. Fischer, Ms. Yellen's second-in-command, warned that under Mr. Trump, \"There will likely also be challenges to the current operating procedures of the Federal Reserve and to its independence.\" \\n\\n     \"Whatever happens, it is critical that we behave -- and be seen to behave -- with the goal of achieving our dual mandate and with a calmness that we have shown in the past,\" Mr. Fischer said. \"The bottom line is very simple: We must do our job.\" \\n\\n     Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  January 14, 2022 18:36 ET (23:36 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",
       "Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment to Buy DVD Kiosk Company Redbox -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Will Feuer \\n\\n \\n\\n     Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment Inc. said it has reached a deal to buy the DVD rental kiosk operator Redbox Entertainment Inc., combining two legacy entertainment companies seeking to compete in the streaming era. \\n\\n     The deal, which would issue 4.6 million shares of Chicken Soup to Redbox, is valued at $36.4 million, according to a Chicken Soup spokeswoman. Chicken Soup will also assume about $321 million of Redbox's outstanding debt. \\n\\n     The deal gives Chicken Soup, which operates the streaming service Crackle and its namesake streaming service, a deeper entertainment footprint as it aims to compete with the likes of Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co. and other streaming platforms. \\n\\n     It also comes after years of struggles at Redbox, which is best known for the more than 38,000 red DVD rental kiosks stationed at grocery stores and other retailers. \\n\\n     Redbox's rental business took a hit during the pandemic due to the limiting of theatrical releases it relies on. It warned earlier this year that its streaming service has failed to drive enough revenue to make up for the rising costs to build it out. It is now saddled with significant debt. \\n\\n     Redbox stock has tumbled almost 80% from a high last year after it returned to the public markets through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. \\n\\n     Chicken Soup operates a series of ad-supported streaming services including Crackle, which it bought from Sony in 2020 and Popcornflix Kids. \\n\\n     Chicken Soup Chief Executive William Rouhana Jr. said the deal will help the company grow in streaming as the industry shifts toward an ad-supported model amid rising competition with subscription services and rising inflation. \\n\\n     Some of the largest streaming services, including Netflix and Disney, have said in recent months they plan to roll out ad-supported options. \\n\\n     Chicken Soup said Redbox shareholders will get a fixed exchange ratio of 0.087 share of common stock in Chicken Soup for each Redbox share they own. Once the deal closes, expected in the second half of the year, Redbox shareholders will own about 23.5% of the combined company, Chicken Soup said. Lender HPS Investment Partners will own about 4.5% of the combined company, diluting current shareholders' ownership. \\n\\n     Shares of Redbox fell 24% to $4.23 a share in recent trading. \\n\\n     Chicken Soup stock rose almost 4% to $8.21 a share.

       "China&apos;s 5.5% Growth Target Is a Big Reach -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Nathaniel Taplin \\n\\n     By the standards of China's rip-roaring economic growth over the past 30 years, \"around 5.5%\" -- the official target for 2022, released over the weekend -- is positively leisurely. \\n\\n     By the standards of 2022, it will be a heavy lift: Fourth-quarter growth in 2021 was just 4% year over year and the nation is still confronting a stark property slowdown and headwinds to consumption from China's \"zero-Covid\" policy, which mandates tough containment measures for even limited outbreaks. \\n\\n     Now, new threats are arising: Rapidly rising Brent crude oil prices, now above $120 a barrel, and a likely further slowdown in global growth and trade due to the conflict in Ukraine. China's enormous trade surpluses, which already were expected to decline this year as developed economies further reopen and shift consumption back toward services, will come under more pressure. \\n\\n     The biggest immediate headwind is rising oil prices. As the world's largest crude importer and energy consumer, China can't avoid a big hit from crude prices which are now up by close to $30 a barrel since late February. Every $20 rise in oil prices knocks about 0.3 percentage point off China's growth, says Goldman Sachs, meaning a hit of half a point this year if oil prices average $135 a barrel for the rest of the year as the bank forecasts. \\n\\n     Meanwhile, despite some tentative positive signs in late 2021, China's critical property sector -- which typically drives around 20% of the economy -- remains deep in the doldrums. Weekly floor space sold in 30 large and medium-size cities, which had begun to recover in late 2021 following easier mortgage-lending standards, has recently fallen back again. A renewed rash of property developer defaults and payment delays has spooked markets and helped push Chinese bond yields, which had been trending down, back up again. \\n\\n     The big hope for 2022 is fiscal policy: While the official deficit forecast ticked down marginally and the quota for local government special project bonds has been held steady, a big chunk of unspent bond proceeds from last year could help boost infrastructure spending. \\n\\n     But there are two problems: First, overall financial conditions appear to be tightening again in the wake of renewed real-estate jitters, meaning higher fiscal spending could be offset by a pullback from households and firms. And second, such special project bonds typically only account for about 20% of total infrastructure spending, notes HSBC. The lion's share is funded by off-budget sources, including land sales -- currently under heavy pressure from the property downturn -- and borrowing by so-called local government financing vehicles. Since the latter are heavily dependent on the bond market, rising yields there will weigh on infrastructure investment, too. \\n\\n     In a critical political year when General Secretary Xi Jinping is bidding for a third term atop the Communist Party, local officials will be under strong pressure to deliver on growth. That translates into an elevated risk of fudged numbers this year. But to hit anything like 5.5% growth in reality -- rather than just on paper -- substantially more stimulus, in particular the monetary variety, will be needed. \\n\\n     Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  March 09, 2022 10:16 ET (15:16 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
       "Credit Markets: Treasurys Fall Amid Upbeat Indicators -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Daniel Kruger \\n\\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (February 2, 2019). \\n\\n     U.S. government bond prices fell Friday after economic data showed the labor market remained robust and manufacturing rebounded in January. \\n\\n     The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note notched its biggest one-day increase since Jan. 4, settling at 2.690%, from 2.631% Thursday. The increase snapped a streak of four consecutive declines. \\n\\n     Yields, which rise when bond prices decline, climbed after the Labor Department said the economy added 304,000 jobs in January and average hourly earnings rose 3.2% from the year before. \\n\\n     Yields then extended their gains after a separate report showed that growth picked up for U.S. manufacturers in January, a sign strong factory-sector demand and output overrode uncertainty surrounding the partial government shutdown in the first month of the year. \\n\\n     The Institute for Supply Management said Friday that its manufacturing purchasing-managers index rose to 56.6 in January from 54.3 in December. Readings above 50 indicate expansion whereas readings below that level denote contraction. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the index to slip slightly to 54.0. \\n\\n     The data suggests that there is little reason for investors to expect the economy will slow down, and a continuation of these kinds of gains as the year progresses could revive discussions about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates later in the year, said Michael Cloherty, head of interest-rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \\n\\n     Concerns about a downturn, or that the Fed could potentially cut rates this year, have \"become less and less realistic given those gains,\" Mr. Cloherty said. \\n\\n     Investor sentiment has showed signs of improvement this year, as stocks posted their best January performance in 30 years and the yield premium over risk-free Treasurys that investors have needed to purchase corporate bonds and high-yield debt narrowed during the past month. \\n\\n     Yields were also pushed higher as investors looked ahead to the rising supply of U.S. government debt, which is expected to grow as the Treasury is scheduled to sell a total of $84 billion of three-, 10- and 30-year securities next week. That compares with $66 billion for the same series of offerings last year. \\n\\n     Write to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  February 02, 2019 02:32 ET (07:32 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",
       "Larry Summers Warns of &apos;Tragedy&apos; If Inflation Isn&apos;t Licked. He&apos;s Right. -- Barrons.com \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Ben Levisohn \\n\\n     Central banks need to finish the job on inflation, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned, and failing to do so would be the ' greatest tragedy.' \\n\\n     Summers was speaking on a CNBC panel in Davos about how the pandemic set the stage for a surge in inflation. Basically, the amount of money spent on fiscal stimulus combined with the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and bond buying was far more than the U.S. economy needed to get through the lockdowns. The result: Inflation the likes we haven't seen in decades. \\n\\n     Central banks, particularly in the U.S. acted and acted quickly. The Federal Reserve raised rates from near 0% to more than 4%, and another increase is expected in February. And as a result, inflation has started falling from its 2022 peak. The Consumer Price Index rose 6.5% year over year in December, down from 7.1% in November. \\n\\n     The financial markets, though, want to see the Fed stop, and maybe even start cutting. The two-year Treasury yield has slipped to 4.17%, down from its November high of 4.726%, a sign that investors are pricing in fewer rate hikes. The Fed Funds futures market, meanwhile, is showing only a 57% chance that rates hit a range of 4.75% to 5% by May. \\n\\n     The Fed shows no signs of slowing down. Fed speakers this week kept talking up the need for more rate hikes, perhaps taking them as high as 5.25% to 5.5%, and holding them there until inflation is defeated. That's exactly what Summers wants to see. \\n\\n     \"The greatest tragedy in this moment would be if central banks were to lurch away from a focus on assuring price stability prematurely and we were to have to fight this battle twice,\" Summers said. \\n\\n     That might be painful for the stock market, however, which seems to want to price in a pivot any chance it gets. \"[Sustainable] rallies for the broad equity indexes have historically required investors to start anticipating actual rate cuts, rather than a mere end to hikes,\" writes UBS strategist Mark Haefele. \"And here, uncertainty is higher. Tight labor markets and continued hawkish commentary mean it is likely to be hard for financial markets to fully anticipate interest rate cuts, and we should therefore expect more volatility in the near term.\" \\n\\n     It's likely to be difficult for the stock market no matter what the Fed does. If it keeps hiking rates, economic growth is likely to take a big hit. If it pivots too soon, inflation will come roaring back, and force another set of rapid rate hikes, which could be even more devastating. \\n\\n     And that is Summer's point. Get inflation under control and a lot of good will come. Let it fester, and we'll have to go through 2022 all over again -- or worse. \\n\\n     Write to Ben Levisohn at ben.levisohn@barrons.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  January 20, 2023 11:25 ET (16:25 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2\n",
       "Will Stocks Be a Trade-War Casualty? -- Barrons.com \\n\\n\\n\\n     The problem with trade wars is that no one really knows whether one's begun. There's been no ringing declaration war from the U.S., Europe or China, but rather a gradual ratcheting up of tariffs. \\n\\n     Michael Cembalest, a top strategist at JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management, isn't waiting for a formal notification. He's already talking up a defensive posture and warning that stocks' momentum could be reversed if the tit for tat escalates. \\n\\n     \"The economic and profit news is good enough that if we only had to deal with higher Fed rates, modestly higher 10-year rates, and the implications of growing fiscal deficits, the next 12 months or so would bring 7%-10% returns on large-cap stocks,\" Cembalest tells my Barron's colleague Leslie P. Norton . \"Throw the tariffs into that mix, and the balance could turn negative.\" \\n\\n     The U.S. currently has $34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports, with $16 billion more to kick in a month from now. But for financial leaders to start using the term \"trade war,\" things would have to ratchet up quite a bit. UBS economists' bar is a \"30% tariff on almost all Chinese imports, a similar response from Beijing and 25% levies on U.S. car imports, matched by all trading partners,\" writes The Wall Street Journal. At Wells Fargo, the view is that \"trade war\" means surcharges of 50% or more. \\n\\n     Semantics aside, Cembalest already sees an impact on the U.S. economy. Producer prices are growing faster, and passing through to consumers. Capital spending \"just rolled over\" despite strong corporate earnings. And industrial metals prices have risen. \\n\\n     \"A lot rides on the next three months,\" he says. The Trump administration has another $200 billion of tariffs on China scheduled to take effect in October. Is it a bluff? Will China blink? Will we wind up with 1920s-type trade barriers?

Here's essential reading on today's developments. \\n\\n  MUST READS FROM WSJ CITY \\n\\n  A relatively hawkish Bank of England held its policy rate at a near-record low of 0.5% but left the door open to a hike in August, and struck a positive note about the outlook for UK economic growth and inflation. And in moves that suggested the divergent paths of the world's largest central banks are gripping smaller ones too, the Swiss National Bank kept its key rate deep in negative territory and Norway's central bank kept rates at a record low. \\n\\n  Ministers from some of the world's biggest oil producers were nearing a deal to lift crude output by about one million barrels a day in an effort to tame recently high prices -- though officials said an agreement might fall well short of that goal in practice. \\n\\n  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich resigned after the company determined he violated company policy during a past, consensual relationship with an Intel employee. The company said that a continuing investigation by internal and external counsel confirmed a violation of Intel's 'non-fraternisation policy,' which applies to all managers. \\n\\n  Walt Disney's blockbuster track record, along with some unique quirks of comic book history, explain why it can top Comcast's bid for 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets, writes Aaron Back for Heard on the Street. \\n\\n  At asset managers, scientists aren't about to outnumber the phones found on the trading floors. But many traditional stock- and bond-picking firms are now spending 'tens of millions of dollars' each to hire mathematical and computer experts. They want these recruits to dive into pools of data in search of trading ideas and blind spots. \\n\\n  Troubled private-equity firm Abraaj Group said it agreed to sell its Latin America, Sub Saharan Africa, North Africa and Turkey funds-management business to Colony Capital, an investment-management firm. The sale of a portion of Abraaj's private-equity business is unlikely to bring an end to the firm's ongoing troubles, as creditors, investors and regulators continue to scrutinise it. \\n\\n  US private-equity firm Carlyle Group raised a new fund aimed at investing across the Asia-Pacific region in technology, consumer and other sectors, many of which are powered by a quickly ascendant middle class. The fund surpassed its target of $5 billion, said the chairman of Carlyle Asia ex-Japan and co-head of Asia buyout \\n\\n  IN THE PAPERS \\n\\n  Nato Opens Door to Trump--Putin Talks -- The Times (GBP) \\n\\n  Martin Sorrell Criticizes WPP's Strategy Following His Departure --  WSJ \\n\\n  UK Creates New 'Settled Status' for EU Citizens After Brexit -- FT (GBP) \\n\\n  US Supreme Court Rules States Can Require Online Merchants to Collect Sales Tax --  WSJ \\n\\n  Israeli Leader Netanyahu's Wife Charged With Fraud --  WSJ \\n\\n  MARKETS TODAY \\n\\n  Global stocks mostly headed lower, with a sharp drop in European car shares underlining the effects of a recent escalation in trade tensions between the US and China. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. \\n\\n  The Dow was on track for its eighth consecutive daily loss. If it fell today and tomorrow, the Dow would suffer its longest losing streak since 1978. The index has fallen for nine or more days just 10 times since 1896. \\n\\n  Daimler, the German car maker, fell 4.3% after releasing a profit warning that cited trade tensions late on Wednesday.

These Stocks Are Seeing Big Gains. -- Barrons.com \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Avi Salzman \\n\\n     U.S.-traded crude oil closed above $70 for the first time in two and a half years on Tuesday, another sign that oil has avoided the mini-slump hitting other commodities in the past few weeks. \\n\\n     West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. benchmark, settled up 1.2% to $70.05. It was the highest close since Oct. 16, 2018. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, settled 1% higher at $72.22 per barrel. \\n\\n     Oil prices have gained as some investors consider the commodity a way to play higher inflation, but the move is also underpinned by more sustainable shifts. Demand is rising and supply is restrained, setting up a prolonged period of strength, analysts say. Stocks whose success is dependent on higher oil prices -- some of which have more debt -- have been outperforming as oil climbs. \\n\\n     Among the winners are Ovintiv (ticker: OVV) and Continental Resources (CLR), both of which have more than tripled from their 52-week lows. Analysts have been recommending that investors look for stocks that can outperform during an oil price spike, as well as those poised to return more cash to shareholders, like EOG Resources (EOG). \\n\\n     Oil is responding to better news about the coronavirus, according to OANDA analyst Edward Moya. \"Crude prices rose after Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, noted that both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca Covid vaccines are effective against the Delta variant post two doses,\" he wrote. \"While the U.S. and large parts of Europe are in a robust crude demand recovery, a lot of the world is still struggling with Covid-19. Emerging markets are getting their hands on more vaccines and that is very positive for oil prices. Brazil's health minister noted they have enough Covid vaccine doses.\" \\n\\n     In addition, oil supply remains muted as producers are focusing on their most productive wells and delaying drilling in areas that may not be as profitable. OPEC is also holding back supply and allowing oil prices to keep moving higher. \\n\\n     Write to Avi Salzman at avi.salzman@barrons.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  June 08, 2021 17:08 ET (21:08 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2\n",
       "How Inflation Hit Households in July: Higher Prices for Food, Electricity and Alcohol Consumed at Home -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Rina Torchinsky \\n\\n \\n\\n     U.S. consumers paid more to eat in July, facing higher prices for peanut butter, meats, eggs and other foods than the month before, the Labor Department said Wednesday. \\n\\n     Shoppers also saw prices climb last month for a range of other goods and services, including medical care, new vehicles and household furnishings, as well as falling prices for used cars and clothing. \\n\\n     Prices for gasoline, air travel and hotels also eased in July, good news for Americans hoping to squeeze in another vacation this summer. \\n\\n     Add it all up, and the department's overall inflation measure -- the consumer-price index -- was flat in July compared with June. But the CPI was 8.5% percent higher in July from a year before -- a rapid rate, though slower than June's 9.1% annual pace -- which was the fastest since November 1981. \\n\\n     Here is a sample of some of the notable seasonally adjusted price changes in the department's categories of goods and services in July from June. \\n\\n     Energy \\n\\n     Gasoline prices dropped 7.7% in July, after shooting up for months due to high crude prices and a shortage of refinery capacity. The average cost of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in the U.S. peaked above $5 in June and has fallen since then to around $4 a gallon, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider owned by Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. \\n\\n     Natural-gas prices fell 3.6% from the prior month, while electricity prices rose 1.6%. \\n\\n     Food \\n\\n     Food prices overall rose 1.1% in July, the seventh consecutive monthly increase of 0.9% or more. They climbed across all of the major categories, including meats, poultry, fish and eggs, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, nonalcoholic beverages, food eaten at home and food eaten away from home. \\n\\n     Breakfast eaters saw prices rise not just for eggs, but also for breakfast sausage, bacon, toast, cereals and bakery products. Coffee prices rose 3.5%. \\n\\n     Peanut butter sandwich fans faced higher prices to assemble the lunchbox staple. Prices for peanut butter and breads other than white bread climbed 3.5%. White bread prices climbed 2%. \\n\\n     Hot dog grillers got a break with the 6.1% fall in the prices of frankfurters. \\n\\n     Transportation \\n\\n     Airline fares declined 7.8% in July, as the industry struggled with staffing shortages and travelers faced frequent delays.

       "Natural-Gas Prices Surge as Summer Cooling Season Switches On -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\n  By Ryan Dezember \\n\\n \\n\\n     Natural-gas prices are heating up ahead of air-conditioning season, adding pressure to household budgets and manufacturing costs. \\n\\n     Futures for June delivery reached $9.399 per million British thermal units on Wednesday before ending at $8.971, up roughly 2% on the day and more than 20% this month. Prices have tripled over the past year and haven't been so high since 2008, which was before frackers flooded the market with cheap shale gas. \\n\\n     Natural gas has been a major driver of inflation, and lately prices have been accelerating. In addition to heating and cooling, gas prices factor into the cost of producing electricity, fertilizer, plastic, cement, steel and glass. Profits are being pinched at businesses ranging from beer-box makers and wallboard manufacturers to bitcoin miners, and higher costs are trickling down to prices for consumers and putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. \\n\\n     Fuel traders and analysts say prices could climb even higher if hot weather arrives and air conditioners are cranked up before enough gas can be injected into storage facilities ahead of winter, when the fuel is burned for heat. \\n\\n     U.S. gas inventories on May 13 were about 15% lower than the five-year average, according to the Energy Information Administration. The EIA is scheduled on Thursday morning to report inventory data through last week. \\n\\n     Inventories have been whittled down by strong demand for liquefied natural gas among European buyers replacing Russian gas and domestic drillers who have been slow to increase production despite the highest prices in years. Meanwhile, the highest Appalachian coal prices ever and reduced hydropower due to drought in the U.S. West have boosted demand for electricity generated by burning gas. \\n\\n     \"There's almost no ceiling for natural gas,\" said Kent Bayazitoglu, analyst at the energy consultant Baker & O'Brien Inc. \"You can reduce your driving a lot easier than you can reduce your natural-gas consumption.\" \\n\\n     Hedge funds and other speculators this month reduced their bets on rising prices as futures climbed from about $7 at the end of April, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. The bullish bets that remain are nearly equal to outstanding short positions, or wagers that prices will fall. \\n\\n     The trading firm Ritterbusch & Associates told clients Wednesday that low inventories and the high number of bets on falling prices were the reasons it lifted its forecast for July futures to rise as high as $10, up from $9. The idea is that if prices keep rising, traders with short positions will have to buy futures to close out their bets, pushing up prices even more. \\n\\n     High oil and gasoline prices could help keep a lid on natural-gas prices by encouraging drilling in such places as West Texas, where crude is the target and a lot of gas is the byproduct, Mr. Bayazitoglu said. He expects natural-gas prices to ease once the first big summer heat wave passes. \\n\\n     \"It's like a roller coaster,\" he said. \"You don't get nervous going down, but going up.\" \\n\\n     Write to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  May 26, 2022 05:30 ET (09:30 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
       "Major Changes Ahead for Prescription-Drug Payments -- WSJ \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Joseph Walker \\n\\n     Drug-pricing rules embedded in the Inflation Reduction Act will trigger the most significant changes in nearly two decades to the way the government pays for prescription drugs, including caps on patient spending and drugmaker price increases. \\n\\n     Legislation that the House of Representatives passed Friday would raise an estimated $739 billion in revenue and spend $433 billion on climate and energy programs as well as health-insurance subsidies for millions of people covered under the Affordable Care Act. President Biden is expected to sign the bill soon. \\n\\n     The legislation also allows for direct-price negotiations on a limited number of medications and puts a cap on the amount that seniors on Medicare pay for medicines annually. Starting in 2025, people who are covered under Medicare's prescription-drug program known as Part D will have annual out-of-pocket costs capped at $2,000, compared with potentially unlimited spending under current law. In addition, Medicare beneficiaries' copays for insulin starting next year would be limited to $35 a month. \\n\\n     The out-of-pocket spending cap would benefit patients who take expensive medications such as some used to treat cancer that can cost patients more than $10,000 annually in copays and coinsurance, said Stacie B. Dusetzina, an associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \\n\\n     The most contentious aspects of the drug-pricing provisions are those requiring Medicare to directly negotiate prices for certain drugs starting in 2026, and requiring drugmakers next year to pay rebates to the government for revenue they make from price increases above the inflation rate. \\n\\n     Democrats passed the bill using a procedure called budget reconciliation that allows them to bypass a Republican filibuster. Using the procedure meant narrowing the inflation-cap rebate provision to Medicare drug spending and excluding the private commercial market, which would have had more far-reaching effects. \\n\\n     The pharmaceutical industry opposes the negotiation and inflation-cap measures, which it said would give the government too much power to set prices and impinge on the development of new drugs. \\n\\n     \"The bill will impose price controls, and price controls will stymie innovation,\" Amgen Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway said on an earnings call in early August. \\n\\n     The revisions represent a watershed change to the Medicare Part D program, which was enacted in 2003 with a prohibition on government negotiation of drug prices. The program was created to be operated by private health insurers who compete against each other by offering the lowest premiums to consumers, providing an incentive to negotiate the lowest prices possible. \\n\\n     The program hasn't worked well for patented medicines that are protected from competition, advocates of the government negotiation say. Changes in the new legislation will help check prescription-drug costs, some advocates say. \\n\\n     \"This is going to be really impactful and put money back in people's pockets,\" said Bill Sweeney, senior vice president for government affairs at AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group for older adults. \\n\\n     Starting in 2026, Medicare will negotiate prices for 10 drugs in Part D from a list of 50 drugs with the highest program spending that have been on the market for nine or 13 years and lack generic competition. Additional drugs would be added each year afterward. \\n\\n     In 2028, Medicare will start negotiating prices for high-spending drugs in the Part B program, which covers outpatient medical care such as drugs that are administered by healthcare professionals. \\n\\n     Write to Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com \\n\\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (August 15, 2022). \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  August 15, 2022 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
       "Traeger Shares Tumble, Touch New Lows on Guidance Shortfall &gt;COOK \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n   By Colin Kellaher \\n \\n\\n  Shares of Traeger Inc. slid more than 10% and hit a new all-time low on Thursday after the grill-maker forecast 2022 results well below Wall Street's expectations, leading a wave of Wall Street analysts to take dimmer views on the stock. \\n\\n  The Salt Lake City company said it expects sales growth to moderate this year after two years of accelerated retail activity driven in part by the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept more people at home and fueled a surge in popularity of at-home barbecuing and grilling. \\n\\n  Traeger said it expects surging inflation and geopolitical turmoil will crimp consumer sentiment and discretionary spending, while continuing global supply-chain issues will pressure its margins. \\n\\n  As a result, Traeger said it expects revenue of $800 million to $850 million this year, representing growth of 2% to 8% after a nearly 44% rise in 2021, and adjusted Ebitda of $70 million to $80 million, down from $109 million last year. \\n\\n  Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting Traeger to post revenue of $956.5 million and adjusted Ebitda of $121.9 million for 2022. \\n\\n  The guidance shortfall led several analysts to cut their ratings and/or price targets on Traeger's shares. \\n\\n  Among the sharpest cuts, analysts at Stifel downgraded the stock to hold from buy and slashed their target price to $7.50 from $26, saying their prior constructive thesis was predicated on share gains and growing household penetration, and that they had expected \"a more graceful anniversary\" of government stimulus and channel fill that helped results early last year. \\n\\n  Stifel added that it now sees more risk than upside potential for the stock, noting that Traeger's leverage is higher than it is comfortable with, given signs of weak demand and economic uncertainty. \\n\\n  At least a half dozen other Wall Street firms also lowered their targets for Traeger shares, but all of the commentary wasn't negative. \\n\\n  BMO Markets, which trimmed its price target to $16 from $23, maintained its outperform rating, saying it believes Traeger's guidance \"will prove prudently conservative,\" and that the company is \"better situated to drive its multi-year top-line trajectory with now-lowered expectations.\" \\n\\n  Traeger shares were recently changing hands at $7.65, down about 13%, after falling to $6.82--the lowest level since the company went public last July--earlier in the session. The stock is down more than 75% from its all-time high of $32.59 reached in August. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  March 24, 2022 11:06 ET (15:06 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2\n",
       "Ecolab Sees 2Q Adjusted EPS Roughly Flat, 2022 Adjusted EPS Up \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n  By Rob Curran \\n\\n \\n\\n  Ecolab Inc. forecast second-quarter operating earnings \"approaching\" year-earlier levels and growth in 2022 profit as it manages the effect of surging raw-material and energy costs by increasing prices and passing on an energy surcharge to customers. \\n\\n  The St. Paul, Minn., provider of water, hygiene and infection-prevention products and services forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings approaching the $1.22 a share level from the prior-year period. \\n\\n  For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings-per share growth in the low teens, based on the timing of the energy surcharge, which it is currently rolling out. The company said the temporary energy surcharge, intended to offset the increase in energy costs due to war in Ukraine, would be up to 12%, which it expects to \"develop progressively through the year.\" The effects of the surcharge would become clearer as it exits the second quarter, the company said. \\n\\n  \"While we expect the impact of substantial raw material and cost inflation to increase further in the second quarter and remain high for the balance of the year, we are also very pleased with our progress on pricing, and now expect it to be in the 6% to 7% range for the balance of the year,\" said President and Chief Executive Christophe Beck. \\n\\n \\n\\n  Write to Rob Curran at rob.curran@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  April 26, 2022 08:55 ET

       "College Endowments Post Biggest Investment Losses Since Financial Crisis -- Barrons.com \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Mary Romano \\n\\n     University endowments posted their worst annual performance since the global financial crisis, battered by stock market losses, rising inflation, and higher interest rates. \\n\\n     Yet the biggest funds were helped by their higher allocations to alternative investments such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds. These investments, which offer a buffer against stock market losses but can be volatile, didn't lose as much ground even as their valuations declined with the market. Fund managers and industry experts warn, though, that further declines in these investments will contribute to any endowment losses in fiscal 2023. \\n\\n     Yale University's $41.4 billion fund, which had targeted just 2.3% for public equities and 47% to alternative investments such as venture capital and hedge funds, gained 0.8% in fiscal 2022. \\n\\n     \"In such a volatile year for the world's financial markets, we are pleased to have protected Yale's capital,\" Yale Chief Investment Officer Matt Mendelsohn said in a statement. \"That said, we expect challenging times ahead as rising interest rates, inflation and the geopolitical environment provide stiff headwinds.\" \\n\\n     School funds lost a median 7.8% in the 12 months through June 30, according to preliminary figures from investment firm Cambridge Associates. That is the worst showing since 2009, when the decline was a median 19%. The last time endowments saw investment losses was in 2016, when they slumped 1.95% on average, according to TIAA and the National Association of College and University Business Officers. \\n\\n     Despite the losses, endowments held up better in the same 2022 period than the S&P 500's loss of 10.6% with reinvested dividends. \\n\\n     \"The losses are coming from public equities, no question,\" Margaret Chen, global head of the endowment and foundation practice at Cambridge Associates, says of the 2022 performance. \"The higher the exposure, the more challenging the return for the fiscal year. The higher the private investments, the better your return on a relative basis.\" \\n\\n     Endowments with more than $1 billion had about 48% of their holdings in investments including private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds, and just 9.9% in U.S. equities as of fiscal 2021, the latest figures available, according to TIAA and NACUBO. Smaller funds -- $251 million to $500 million in assets -- had 26.1% in private investments and 25.2% in U.S. stocks. \\n\\n     The turnaround in performance follows a blockbuster fiscal 2021. Endowments gained 30.6%, on average, in the 12 months through June 30, 2021, according to TIAA and NACUBO. For instance, Duke University's endowment had an investment loss of 1.5% for fiscal 2022, compared with a 55.9% gain in the prior year. \\n\\n     \"It was a dramatic swing in performance from the last fiscal year to this fiscal year, and it's challenging to manage through that,\" Chen says. \\n\\n     Harvard on Thursday said its $50.9 billion fund lost 1.8%. The fund's strongest performers were its investments in private equity and venture capital, said Narv Narvekar, CEO of Harvard Management Company, which manages the endowment. \\n\\n     \"The more private assets an investor had in its portfolio in FY22, the stronger their performance,\" Narvekar wrote in Harvard's annual report. \"This is somewhat counterintuitive and may indicate that private managers have not yet marked their portfolios to reflect general market conditions.\" \\n\\n     He added that \"we expect that the end of the current calendar year might present meaningful adjustments to these valuations, as investment managers audit their portfolios.\" \\n\\n     Such markdowns are already happening, Chen says. \\n\\n     \"We are seeing them being marked down as the market declines further,\" Chen says. \"Fiscal 2023 will be more indicative of how things are marked down since there's always a lag because of the reporting methodology.\" \\n\\n     Write to editors@barrons.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  October 13, 2022 13:03 ET (17:03 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "U.S. Consumer Prices Rose 0.2% in July \\n\\n\\n\\nBy Josh Mitchell and Sarah Chaney \\n\\n     WASHINGTON -- Inflation picked up modestly in July, eating up Americans' wage gains. \\n\\n     The consumer-price index -- a broad measure of Americans' living expenses, from groceries to dental care -- rose 0.2% from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Friday. Excluding food and energy components, so-called core prices rose 0.2% as well. \\n\\n     The increases fell in line with economists' expectations. \\n\\n     Overall prices have climbed 2.9% over the past year, near the biggest gains of the expansion. Core prices increased 2.4%, the biggest 12-month gain since September 2008. \\n\\n     The report suggests inflation is steadily, but not rapidly, increasing as the economy heats up. The latest gain is likely to reassure the Federal Reserve as it considers raising interest rates -- it has penciled in two more increases for this year -- to keep the economy on an even keel. \\n\\n     But the higher prices also mean Americans' are losing purchasing power. A separate report released Friday showed average hourly earnings were flat in July, and average weekly earnings fell 0.2%. \\n\\n     Over the past year, average hourly earnings have fallen 0.2% while weekly earnings have climbed 0.1%. \\n\\n     The weak growth in earnings, relative to inflation, could constrain Americans' ability to spend and thus weigh on the broader economy. \\n\\n     Higher housing costs drove last month's gain in overall prices. A rise in so-called shelter costs -- reflecting rent and mortgage costs -- accounted for 60% of last month's gain in the overall index. \\n\\n     Broadly, most consumer prices are rising over the past year. Energy prices have climbed 12.1% over the past 12 months, driven by higher gasoline costs. \\n\\n     The inflation outlook is cloudy. Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could push up inflation. But a rise in the dollar could weigh on it. \\n\\n     Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com \\n\\n \\n\\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\\n\\n  August 10, 2018 08:33 ET (12:33 GMT)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
