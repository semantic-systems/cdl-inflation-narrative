1,"New Central Bank Chief Named In Argentina

 

  BUENOS AIRES -AP- Argentina's minister of economy, Antonio Erman Gonzalez, said he has accepted the resignation of central bank President Rodolfo Rossi and that Enrique Folcini, a conservative economist, had been chosen to replace him. 

  Gonzales said that Rossi, who had been named chief of the central bank a little more than a month ago, ""had not been fired,"" noting that he would continue as an adviser on banking to Argentina's President Carlos Menem. 

  Rossi said he had resigned because of a dispute with private banking concerns. 

  Folcini will be the fourth central bank president since Menem took office a little more than six months ago. 

  Folcini was director of the central bank during the military regime that took power in 1976. 

  Rodolfo Rossi, who lasted five weeks as president of Argentina's central bank, was forced out by private banks troubled by the government's decision on Jan. 1 to convert several billion dollars of short-term certificates of deposits to 10-year bonds, analysts said. 

  That move curtailed currency speculation that was devaluing the austral in great chunks, and brought down interest rates that in December topped a ruinous 600% a month, by abruptly restricting the money supply. 

  However, private banks argued that reserves held by the Central Bank are not enough to cover the new bonds, and wrangled with Economy Ministry officials to expand the use of the bonds. 

  Specifically, banks want approval to buy bonds on the secondary market, where they are trading at about half-price, and use them, at full value, to cancel debts owed to investors and the government. 

  ""Of course, that would be tremendously profitable for them,"" a Central Bank official said in a telephone interview.  ""Of course, the state can't allow them to do that."" 

  Rossi opposed that plan and suggested that a compensatory fund be set up to resolve banks' losses, but deny them excess profits. 

  Rossi's resignation was rumored for days. In fact, he handed it to Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez last Friday, the Central Bank official confirmed. 

  In his short tenure, Rossi also reportedly lost favor with his own Union of the Democratic Center political party when the Central Bank printed 1 trillion australs this month, an amount that almost doubled the money supply. 

  That monetary expansion, which Rossi had pledged to quell, almost certainly will fuel inflation, which soared by 40% in December and is projected to increase by at least that much this month.

  Fed Chairman Greenspan told the Ways and Means Committee that ""although foreign direct investment in the U.S. has grown very rapidly, it is still relatively small."" 

  For manufacturing as whole, he said, the direct investment affiliates accounted for 13 pc of assets and 11 pc of sales in 1987, the last year for which data were available. 

  Greenspan said one area of foreign direct investment of particular concern to the Fed was the banking industry, saying foreign-bank banks account for about one-fifth of all banking assets in the U.S. 

  But in many cases, he added, foreign banks conduct largely international transactions at their U.S. offices. 

  He warned that departure from a policy of ""national treatment"" in the banking industry could produce retaliation and could seriously complicate negotiations to ensure the access of U.S. banks to markets abroad, particularly to Europe after 1992. 

  Greenspan told the panel that globalization of markets benefit both the U.S. and the rest of the world, and repeatedly warned that efforts to insulate the U.S. from the forces of increasing globalization could be very costly. 

  At the same time, the Fed chairman said, continued efforts should be made to limit risks in international payments and securities settlement systems and to protect investors by increasing international cooperation and coordination of supervision and regulation. 

  Saying the U.S. could help ensure the orderly progress of global integration by reducing its current account imbalance, Greenspan said: ""The necessary policies are not those that attack the symptoms - large accumulations of foreign assets in the U.S. - but rather policies that address the underlying cause, which is our inadequate national savings, particularly our large federal budget deficit."" 

  Fed Chairman Greenspan told the House panel that portfolio considerations are playing an important role in the globalization of securities markets. ""As the welfare of people in the United States and abroad becomes increasingly dependent on the performance of foreign economies, it is natural for both individual investors and institutions to raise the share of foreign securities in investment portfolios,"" he said. 

  In discussing forces facilitating the globalization of capital markets, Greenspan said one factor contributing to an increase in Japanese gross investments abroad may have been the rise in stock and land prices in Japan that has been leveraged to finance these increased investments. 

  During the 1980s, Greenspan said, the U.S. net international investment position, as reported by the Commerce Department, ""fell sharply from a positive $141 billion at the end of 1981, to a negative $533 billion at the end of 1988."" 

  But, he said, these numbers should not be viewed as precise measures of the U.S.'s net international indebtedness for various technical reasons.  Still, he said, ""the direction and magnitude of recent changes are clear consequences of the U.S.'s current account deficits."" 

  He said growing U.S. net international indebtedness and the U.S.'s large current account deficits are two sides of the same coin. 

  He said that ""the most important underlying cause of the surge in our net borrowing from foreigners and the deterioration in our external balance has been the substantial decline in our national savings rate against the background of a relatively stable investment rate."" He said the decline in savings reflected in part the expansion of the budget deficit. 

  ""The fundamental accounting identity between savings and investment, of course, requires that any shortfall of domestic savings below domestic investment be made up in the form of a net inflow of savings from abroad,"" Greenspan said.

  Bethlehem Steel Corp.  attributed lower fourth quarter earnings to higher costs and softening demand in certain product lines.  In particular, prices for alloys and other purchased materials were significantly higher than 1988, the company said. 

  Higher costs were also incurred as a result of an outage at the Sparrows Point plant blast furnace and work stoppages at its coal mines, the company said.  A new labor contract with the United Steelworkers effective June 1 also raised employment costs. 

  The company said shipments were ""strong during the first half of the year,"" aided by its flat rolled products operations, but declined in the second half of the year as demand weakened, particularly from the automotive market. 

  Operating income from its basic steel operations fell to $63 million in the fourth quarter from $78 million, the company said.  For the year, operating income fell to $406 million from $528 million.

6,"Canadian Dollar - Key Rate -2-

 

  Mark Chandler, economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said investors are taking a ""poor view"" of the Canadian dollar because of weak economic fundamentals, particularly Canada's fourth-quarter current account deficit. 

  Economists estimate that the current account deficit widened to an annual rate of C$20 billion in the 1989 fourth quarter. 

  The fourth-quarter current account figure is to be announced March 1 along with Canada's fourth-quarter gross domestic product. 

  Some analysts predicted only marginal growth in the fourth quarter, while others said they believe GDP declined in the three-month period. 

  Finance Minister Michael Wilson defended the Bank of Canada's monetary policy in the House of Commons earlier this session, saying high rates were necessary because Canada faces a ""tough inflation problem.""  Canada's Consumer Price Index rose an average annual rate of 5 pc in 1989, the highest rate since 1983. 

  Bank of Canada Governor John Crow is to meet with the central bank's board of directors next Friday, but isn't expected to change monetary policy before the federal government's budget is introduced Feb. 20. 

  Secretary of State for Finance Gilles Loiselle reaffirmed in the House of Commons this session the government's support for the Bank of Canada's fight against inflation. ""Inflation is a threat,"" Loiselle said. 

  He called the current economic situation ""volatile"" and said the government wants to bring rates down, but it wants to do it by ""fighting inflation.""  He said the Bank of Canada eased short-term rates in mid-January because it had seen the ""first signs that things were easing up a bit."" 

  Aron Gampel, senior economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia, said this morning's unemployment report will likely ""compound the negative sentiment in the financial markets."" He said investor expectations of a continuing tight monetary stance have intensified. 

  But Gampel said the unemployment report ""overstates the strength of Canadian employment conditions.""  He said mounting layoffs in the auto sector, fisheries and primary industries will drag employment growth down in coming months.

7,"Newhall Land Puts 4th Qtr Net At 70c-75c A Unit Vs 25c

 
   By Jeff Rowe 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  VALENCIA, Calif. -DJ- Bolstered by rising land prices and a good citrus crop, Newhall Land & Farming Co.  expects to report 1989 net income of between $67 million and $69 million, or $1.70 to $1.75 per partnership unit, up 28 pc from 1988, Thomas L. Lee, president and chief executive officer, told Dow Jones. 

  For 1988, net income was $53.6 million, or $1.35 a unit, on revenue of $208.2 million. 

  ""1989 was a record year for homebuilding,"" Lee said. The house building, commercial development and agriculture company said it expects revenue for the year to be about $238 million, up 14 pc from 1988.  The company has withdrawn almost completely from the oil and gas business, Lee said. 

  Fourth quarter net income was between $28 million and $29 million, or from 70 cents to 75 cents a unit, he said, compared to net income of $10.1 million, or 25 cents a unit. The record-for-any-quarter performance was due to significant housing completions in the quarter, Lee said.  Revenue was about $97 million, Lee said, compared to revenue of $69.8 million for the comparable 1988 period. 

  A two-for-one partnership unit split was distributed Jan. 29 and the 20-cent distribution likely will remain at least until the end of the year. 

  Lee said the company will continue to repurchase units, noting that since the beginning of this year Newhall Land has repurchased 750,000 units and a total of 14 pc of the outstanding units since the repurchasing program began in Novomber 1987.  Currently, there are about 38 million units outstanding. 

  Lee said Newhall's total appraised land value exceeded $1 billion for the first time ever at Dec. 31, 1989.  ""It's a reflection of the rising land values in California,"" he said, noting that the trend is expected to continue.  ""Over the last five years, the appraised values have grown at a compound annual rate of 19 pc,"" he added. 

  Lee said the residential real estate market has slowed somewhat this year but the company expects 1990 will be a ""very good year"" at its giant industrial parks in Valencia, a rapidly-growing area about 30 miles north of Los Angeles. 

  At the company's Valencia Industrial Center, building absorption last year was 1.4 million square feet, up 40 pc from the average of the prior three years. 

  About two million square feet remain to be sold and developed at the 1,500-acre industrial center, but at the company's nearby 1,600-acre Valencia Commerce Center, there is room for about 11 million square feet of commercial and industrial buildings. 

  ""1990 could be a tremendous year for us,"" Lee said.

8,"&apos;Zero Inflation&apos; Seen As Non- Starter Despite Tough Talk

 
   By John Connor 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Tomorrow, with another Federal Open Market Committee meeting at hand, four Federal Reserve Bank Presidents will testify before Congress on legislation that seeks formally to elevate the obliteration of inflation to primacy among the Fed's goals. 

  Given the forum and cast of characters at the hearing, it shouldn't be surprising if the Fed comes off sounding prepared to quash inflation, come what may. 

  The hearing will be held by the House Domestic Monetary Policy Subcommittee, whose chairman, Rep.  Steve Neal, D-N.C., champions a ""zero inflation"" measure that has been endorsed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. 

  Greenspan sees the zero inflation goal achieved when ""expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions."" 

  Greenspan told Congress last week that the current inflation rate of about 4.5 pc is ""unacceptable"" and that inflationary expectations are rising moderately worldwide. This, coupled with Greenspan's view that chances of a recession are waning, created an immediately generalized perception in Fed-watching circles that monetary easing has been put on hold. 

  Also, Greenspan cited as a cause of higher long-term interest rates in the U.S. the diversion of Japanese and European capital from the U.S.  due to rising interest rates abroad. Economist Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., put it this way: ""Right now, foreign rates are providing a floor, or elevator if you will, to American interest rates.  In this environment, the Fed's ability to influence the course of American interest rates, and thereby the economy, is severely limited, if not crippled."" 

  Still, the Congressional Budget Office said last Friday that most private-sector forecasters share its view that ""the Federal Reserve will safely steer the economy between the shoals of a recession and higher inflation by further reducing interest rates this year.""

   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Salomon Brothers analyst Bonnie Rivers tells Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that she upgraded Golden Poultry Co. to the firm's ""outperform"" or ""buy"" rating yesterday afternoon because she expects broiler prices to continue to rise and she sees the export market for chickens strengthening. 

  Previously, Rivers had a ""hold"" rating on the stock, which in Salomon's terms means she had expected it to match the market's performance. 

  Golden Poultry is up 1 1-8, or 13.8 pc, at 9 1-4 on OTC volume of 75,100 shares, more than four times its average daily volume of about 15,000 shares. 

  Rivers says she also raised her earnings estimate for the company's year ending in June to 45 cents a share from 40 cents. 

  Golden Poultry earned $1.20 a share in fiscal 1989. 

  Golden Poultry officials aren't immediately available for comment. 

  Rivers says she expects the Georgia dock price for broilers, which will be announced this afternoon, to be up again, following last week's increase of 1.75 cents a pound. She also notes that industry production for the export market is currently at about 8 pc and it usually runs at about 3 pc to 4 pc. 

  Early last week, Golden Poultry reported a second-quarter loss of five cents a share and blamed the loss on lower broiler prices because of industry overproduction and problems in processing and packaging operations at its Sanford, N.C., plant.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Piloted by booming aircraft orders, new factory orders in December rose 1.9 pc to a seasonally adjusted $244.20 billion, the Commerce Department said. 

  Most of the December increase was in durable goods orders, nearly all for transportation equipment, Commerce said. Within transportation equipment, the department said, large increases in aircraft and parts and shipbuilding and tanks more than offset a decline in motor vehicles and parts. 

  Orders for durable goods in December rose 3.2 pc to an adjusted $134.35 billion, after rising 4.8 pc in November to $130.18 billion. In its advance report, the department had reported durable goods orders rose 2.5 pc. 

  The December factory orders increase compared with an unrevised increase of 2.4 pc in November to an adjusted $239.71 billion and an unrevised 0.1 pc decline in October to an adjusted $234.07 billion. 

  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report survey of 12 economists published yesterday found an average estimate of a 1.6 pc gain in December factory orders. 

  For all of 1989, factory orders rose 6.4 pc to $2.830 trillion, after rising 9.7 pc in 1988, Commerce said. 

  For all of 1989, durable goods orders rose 5.9 pc to $1.520 trillion, after rising 11.0 pc in 1988, Commerce said.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Former Energy Secretary James Schlesinger said the world may face a ""repetition"" of the oil crises of the 1970s by 1992. 

  Speaking at a conference sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies Friday, the former secretary predicted that, around that time, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effective crude oil production capacity of 25 million barrels a day would be reached. 

  ""When demand exceeds capacity, prices will rise,"" he said. 

  The Mideast is unlikely to be able to increase its capacity without substantial investment.  Schlesinger put the figure for that investment at $32 billion.  He said the Arabian countries have been unable to get this capital infusion without an increase of oil prices to at least $24 a barrel.  Oil companies banks and international lenders, particularly the Japanese, were reluctant to commit funds in that region because of an insufficient oil price and political instability. 

  ""They will get this capital,"" he predicted, but between the time they get it and the time the facilities are built there will be some ""stringency"" in oil supply.

  BRASILIA -AP- Fernando Collor de Mello, inaugurated today for a five-year term as Brazil's first popularly elected president in 29 years, pledged sweeping reforms to end corruption and inflation. 

  Many people were nervous about economic measures Collor de Mello has said he will announce tomorrow to slash crippling inflation, running at 2,700 pc yearly.  Banks were closed on Tuesday for three days to halt frenzied speculation, and police were called to shops that illegally increased prices. 

  Collor de Mello promised to revert the unprecedented economic crisis.  ""Inflation is enemy No. 1,"" he said. ""My presidency will wager everything on victory against this social cancer."" 

  He said Brazil would encourage modernization of the largely state-controlled economy and welcome foreign investment. 

  Expectations of a brief wage-and-price freeze, massive layoffs of federal employees and other drastic measures to cut Brazil's $31 billion budget deficit sent tremors across the nation of 150 million people. 

  Government officials ordered shop owners not to raise prices, and police visited stores that failed to heed the warning.  Some shops raised prices by as much as 150 pc.

  TOKYO -DJ- Amid growing speculation that a discount-rate increase is in the immediate future, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said there's no change in the central bank's basic stance of monitoring the effects of its last rate increase. 

  Speaking upon his return from a nine-day European trip, Mieno said the recent confusion in financial markets is only one of many factors that will influence the central bank's decisions on monetary policy. 

  Mieno said he was ""unhappy"" with the yen's continued weakening, which he termed speculative.  But he insisted that Japan's economic fundamentals remain very strong. 

  Mieno said ""strong, well balanced economic growth"" with stable prices is continuing in Japan.  Reiterating past statements, the central bank governor said that latent inflationary pressures remain a danger to current price stability. 

  Mieno mentioned the high price of oil, high money-supply growth and the yen's weakness as factors threatening price stability. 

  Mieno said it is difficult to understand why the yen continues to weaken against the dollar, considering the strength of the Japanese economy.  He pledged that coordinated intervention by the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies to stop the dollar's rise would continue. 

  Mieno said he couldn't comment on recent statements by G-7 central bank officials suggesting that current exchange rates were acceptable.  He said he hadn't heard any official statements to that effect, and couldn't comment on remarks made by individuals. 

  After talking with G-7 central bank officials at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) meeting in Basel last weekend, Mieno said he believes that the central banks' commitment to coordinated intervention ""has not weakened at all.""

15,"Dayton Hudson Says 4th Period Net Rose 37% On 9% Sales Gain

 
   By Francine Schwadel 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  MINNEAPOLIS -DJ- Dayton Hudson Corp. expects to report earnings of $250 million, or $3.45 per fully diluted share, for the 14-week fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth A.  Macke. 

  In the 13-week period a year ago, the company earned $182 million, or $2.31 a share. The per-share figures represent a sharper rise  than net income because Dayton Hudson repurchased seven million shares. 

  Macke told Dow Jones in an interview that the expected 37% earnings increase is due to a strong performance at the company's retail units and to a credit for adjusting inventories for inflation. 

  Dayton Hudson plans to release its earnings on Thursday. 

  Macke attributed the strong showing to a 9% increase in sales to $4.48 billion from $4.1 billion a year-earlier.  But he said the fourth-quarter figures also got a boost from a credit of $31 million, or 26 cents a share, for adjusting the company's inventories for inflation.  In the year-ago quarter, such adjustments resulted in a charge of $8 million, or 6 cents a share. 

  For the 53-week fiscal year, Macke said Dayton Hudson would report record earnings of $410 million, or $5.35 a share on a fully diluted basis.  That represents a 43% increase over the $287 million, or $3.45 a share, the company earned in its previous fiscal year. 

  Sales in the latest fiscal year rose nearly 12% to $13.64 billion from $12.2 billion, he said.  He said inventory adjustments for the year resulted in a charge of less than $1 million, or less than 1 cent a share, compared with charges of $44 million, or 32 cents a share, in fiscal 1988.

16,"Dollar Ends Lower In N.Y.; At 1.6780 Marks, 158.73 Yen

 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Strong buying of deutsche marks on renewed confidence in the Deutsche Bundesbank's ability to control West German inflation sent the dollar 2 pfennigs lower against the West German currency Wednesday. 

  Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.6780 deutsche marks, down sharply from 1.6980 marks late yesterday in New York.  The U.S.  currency was also changing hands at 158.73 yen, below 158.95 yen in New York late yesterday.  Sterling was trading at $1.6405, higher than $1.6347 late yesterday. 

  The U.S. currency also ended the day moderately lower against the yen amid broad dollar weakness inspired by the market's bullish stance on the mark and participants' continuing focus on non-dollar dealings, traders said. 

  The mark began its surge at the beginning of the European day after the release of news on the Bundesbank's 1989 annual report, in which it pledged to maintain a strong mark as a means to help contain inflation. 

  The annual report, which suggested that the central bank was prepared to defend the mark either through intervention or by raising interest rates, relaxed market anxiety about the ramifications of monetary integration that had damped interest in the West German currency recently, participants said. 

  Typical of the market's reaction to the central bank's annual report was a comment by Carl Amendola, a vice president at Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG in New York, who expressed confidence that ""any inflationary outburst will be handled in the most efficient manner by the Bundesbank."" 

  The report was also seen as reassurance that the central bank will have the last word on how the consequences of monetary union are managed, following the West German government's decision to apply a 1 deutsche mark-to-1 Ostmark exchange ratio more widely than the Bundesbank had recommended. 

  The Bundesbank news also served to fuel another day of strong mark gains against the yen, lending added impetus to a shift toward long mark positions in mark-yen dealings that began yesterday.  The West German currency rose to around 94.59 yen late today in New York from 93.99 yen in late Tokyo dealings and from 93.61 yen late yesterday in New York.

  Bruce L. Engel, president of WTD Industries Inc. said, ""For the past five months, lumber and chip markets have not supported escalating market prices for logs, except in the most efficient mills.  Concerns for future log supplies generated by preservationist pressures may extend the log 

price escalation.   WTD will meet this challenge with reorganization of mill operations not readily able to contribute to profit margins."" 

  Slated for at least April shutdown are a chip and veneer recovery mill at Goshen, Ore., a dimension lumber mill at Junction City, Ore., and a stud mill at Valley, Wash.  These mills will be reopened if market conditions improve. 

  WTD will also defer indefinitely startup of a stud mill in Cottage Grove, Ore., and a veneer mill in Yoncalla, Ore. 

  The company plans to write down previously closed mills in Eugene and Union, Ore., and Olympia, Wash.  These mills, all relatively small-volume producers of lumber cut from large, more expensive logs, will then either be sold or liquidated in coming months.  They were closed during most of the present fiscal year. 

  Also planned for writedown will be the company's investment in its Port Westward, Ore., pulp mill project. The state of Oregon denied a permit for the proposed bleached kraft mill at the site last November and the prospect of future permitting remains uncertain, WTD said.

18,"Parry Doesn&apos;t Want Recession As Anti-Inflation Tactic

 
   By Hilary Stout 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Parry told Dow Jones that he expects inflation to be worse this year than last, but he doesn't support pushing the economy into a recession to wring inflation from the system. 

  Parry predicted that inflation will moderate from its swift pace of the first quarter, but he cautioned: ""I still think you're going to settle in at a rate that's uncomfortable and unacceptable. 

  ""One has to see at this point that inflation is going to be higher in 1990 than 1989,"" he predicted. 

  But Parry, who is known as one of the Fed's staunchest anti-inflation voices, said: ""At this point I am not willing to say we ought to aim for a recession to produce faster adjustment"" in the inflation rate. 

  ""Aiming for a recession causes a lot of pain and suffering,"" he said.  And recessions are often followed by ""a shot in the arm"" for the economy, which can spawn an inflation problem all over again, he added. 

  Parry spoke to Dow Jones a few days after the government reported that the consumer price index rose at an 8.5 pc annual rate in the first quarter, its fastest pace since the spring of 1982, when the country was emerging from a wrenching bout of double-digit inflation. Much of the winter spike stemmed from a surge in food and energy prices after a bitter cold wave wiped out crops and boosted energy use, depleting supplies. 

  Over the past 12 months, according to the government, consumer prices have risen 5.2 pc. Citing a recent retreat of energy prices from their January highs, Parry said inflation was likely to fall back below 5 pc for 1990, but he predicted the rate would be faster than the 4.6 pc pace for 1989. 

  Parry said the best recipe for curing inflation is slow, steady growth over the long haul. But he predicted that the economy's current pace of expansion will lead only to mild gains against inflation. 

  Parry forecast that the economy's inflation-adjusted growth in 1990 will be ""slightly over 2 pc,"" compared with 1989 growth of 3 pc.  But he said he ""wouldn't be upset if growth were a little lower."" 

  Two percent growth this year ""will help but it isn't going to produce any significant change in inflation,"" he explained. ""If (the economy's) potential growth is 2.5 pc to 3 pc the amount of slack that likely to result from growth a little over 2 pc is not that great."" 

  Parry estimated that growth in the first quarter could have been ""as high as 2.5 pc to 3 pc."" Next Friday, the Commerce Department will disclose its first estimate of first-quarter growth. 

  Parry does not currently vote on the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.

  Cyprus Minerals Co. said the decline in its first quarter earnings was due largely to lower 1990 copper and molybdenum prices. 

  Cyprus said copper prices averaged $1.13 per pound during the first quarter of 1990, down 34 cents per pound from the first quarter of 1989. 

  Cyprus' average mine production costs for copper, including depreciation, averaged 77 cents per pound during the quarter, compared with 1989 costs of 70 cents per pound. The higher costs in 1990 primarily resulted from reduced recoveries at the Sierrita-Twin Buttes operation where milling difficulties, the results of blending ore from four different pits, were encountered during the 1989 fourth quarter and continued in early 1990. 

  The company said Sierrita's recoveries are expected to improve during the second quarter. 

  Kenneth J. Barr, Cyprus president and chief executive officer predicted that 1990 earnings would be ""good, but not record-breaking.""

  NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -DJ- Johnson & Johnson said it would record a $125 million, or 38 cents a share, non-recurring charge against first-quarter net earnings ""due to the severe economic turmoil, inflation, exorbitantly high and volatile interest rates, and deteriorating business conditions in certain Latin American countries."" 

  The charge, composed of a number of separate actions, includes a provision for the write-off and planned restructuring of several Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries in certain Latin American countries, principally Argentina, and a provision for the additional interest associated with the company's Argentine debt, which has since been liquidated. 

  In a press release, the company said the charge also includes a provision to recognize the adverse impact of the recent monetary restrictions imposed in Brazil.  Johnson & Johnson's Brazilian operations have a strong presence in their respective markets, and are unaffected by the restructuring program, Johnson & Johnson said. 

  Johnson & Johnson didn't say specifically what earnings it expects to report for the lastest fourth quarter.

21,"Bank Of Japan Warns Land Prices Could Turn Lower

 

  TOKYO -DJ- The steady rise in Japanese land prices in the late 1980s could turn around and trigger widespread financial problems, the Bank of Japan warned. 

  History doesn't bear out a view common among individuals as well as corporations in Japan ""that land prices will keep climbing and never decline,"" the central bank cautioned in a report.  Despite contrary examples, that sense of inevitability is driving economic decisions and poses a risk to the economy. 

  The Bank of Japan urged legal and tax reforms to eliminate incentives for property speculation and encourage more efficient land use.  In the meantime, it said, finanicial institutions must be monitored closely to insure that a tumble in land prices doesn't lead to turbulence in the financial system and undermine the value of the currency. 

  Scarcity is typically cited as the basic factor underlying high Japaness land prices. ""But more fundamentally, institutional factors such as the tax and legal systems seem to work to push up land prices by inhibiting the more efficient utilization of land,"" the Bank of Japan said. 

  Cases in the U.S. and the U.K. show that when land prices climb steeply over a short period, they may turn lower again, adversely affecting financial institutions involved in property lending, the Bank of Japan noted. In the case of the savings and loan boondoggle in the U.S. and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K., falling land prices upset the financial system and hit lower-tier institutions and non-bank financial firms in particular. 

  While both the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry have instructed banks to cut back their lending for property purchases, non-bank institutions such as leasing firms have moved to fill the gap in funds.

  In April, the producer price index is expected to have risen 0.2 pc, with the index seen up 0.3 pc if food and energy prices are excluded, according to the average estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

  A PPI report in line with market expectations would not be enough to prompt a Fed easing, says Foster of Citibank. 

  Before the Fed will seriously consider an easing move, the inflation data ""would have to show a bouncing off from the recent trend,"" says Foster. 

  But, she adds, ""with the economy showing signs of slowing, the next move will be an easing,"" although the timing is far from certain. 

  The FOMC has been deeply split recently, with some members calling for an easing in order to bolster an unstable economy and others urging a tightening as the only means of purging the economy of inflation, which has failed to abate. 

  A big question about the upcoming FOMC meeting is ""just how far the more hawkish members are willing to push the fear-of-inflation scenario if the real sector is not showing the kind of strength"" that would threaten to push inflation higher, says Engler of Chemical Bank.  ""It will be interesting to see if they hold the line on their anti-inflation bias."" 

  A once-dormant factor that has moved to the forefront in terms of monetary policy is the federal budget deficit, which is expected to be so far out of line with the Gramm-Rudman targets that congressional leaders and the President have agreed to sit down and discuss plans to reduce it significantly. 

  The planned budget summit has prompted so much enthusiasm that some market participants say it alone is reason to consider an easing. 

  ""The Fed would like nothing more than a grand compromise"" that resulted in a reduced deficit, says Johnson of First Chicago. 

  ""If the Fed were sure they would get one, they would be more inclined to ease.  But they are a long way from assuming that anything will get done,"" he says. 

  If Congress and the administration ""agree on a plan that was convincing, with increased taxes and spending cuts, at some point the Fed would have to follow with an easing of policy, especially if the plan was put in place with an economy that was weak,"" says Engler. 

  But given the persistence of the deficit, and the repeated failure to successfully deal with it which has resulted in a justified skepticism by market participants, ""it would have to be a done deal"" before the Fed would consider responding with a change in policy, Engler contends.

  Fuji Heavy Industries officials said the costs of starting up a new Indiana-based joint venture, Subaru Isuzu Automotive Inc., last October served to drag profits down.  The joint venture is with another Japanese car maker, Isuzu Motors Ltd. 

  ""It cost us a lot to get that company started,"" one company treasury official said.  ""And we think it's going to stay in the red for the next couple of years."" 

  Another U.S. subsidiary, Subaru Of America Inc., in which Fuji Heavy Industries holds a 49.6 pc stake, did poorly during the year as a result of a demand slowdown in the U.S. and difficulties involved in model changes, according to officials. 

  Officials noted that their company earlier this month rached an agreement to buy the 50.4 pc of Subaru of America's common stock it didn't already own for $6 a share and will turn the company into a wholly owned subsidiary, probably this summer following approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

  During fiscal 1990, officials said, the yen's appreciation forced their company to raise the prices of its cars in the U.S. and suffer a decline in price competitiveness, leading to the slumping sales. 

  Fuji Heavy Industries didn't provide sales details or projections for fiscal 1991 in its consolidated report.

25,"New Milk Subsidies Included In 1990 Farm Legislation

 

  WASHINGTON -AP- A revision of government support for dairy farmers is being included in the 1990 farm bill. 

  The House Agriculture Committee completed work yesterday on the key portions of its dairy section of the bill that will set government policy on agriculture for the next five years. 

  Earlier in the day, the Senate Agriculture Committee approved legislation that makes seafood inspection part of the farm bill for the first time. 

  Under the House committee's dairy plan, the current government price would never go below $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk. 

  If surpluses fall below 3.5 billion pounds, the government would pay $10.55 per hundredweight.  Additional conditions are included in the bill. 

  The government traditionally has supported dairy farmers by setting a price it will pay for storable dairy products, like cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk, that aren't bought by processors in the open market. 

  However, overproduction has been an expensive problem for the government which lawmakers have been trying to correct. Gunderson said the new program would continue to move toward greater market orientation. 

  -0- 

  Committee staffers estimated that the dairy plan would cost $1.6 billion more than what the current dairy program would cost if it were extended for the next five years. But they said that the plan would still be consistent with Senate Budget Committee guidelines, which House lawmakers are prepared to follow in the event of a deficit-reduction agreement. 

  The government buys surplus cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk whenever commercial demand isn't sufficient to keep milk prices from slipping below the support price. 

  If government purchases were forecast to exceed seven billion pounds in any year, the Agriculture Department could inaugurate an inventory management program, beginning in 1992, to hold down milk production. 

  The compromise was offered by Rep.  Charles Stenholm (D., Texas), chairman of the dairy subcommittee, and Rep.  Steve Gunderson (R., Wis.), the ranking minority member, as an alternative to a plan that had been embraced earlier by the subcommittee. 

  That plan would have set a floor price of $10.60 per hundred pounds, imposed assessments on dairy farmers to discourage production and created a standby system of two-tier price supports. The Bush administration and some farm groups strongly objected to a two-tier system.

  LONDON -DJ- John Smith, the British Labour Party's chief economic spokesman, says a Labour government's first priority would be restoring the health of the country's economy rather than pushing the full social spending program outlined in the party's recent policy review. 

  In an interview with Dow Jones, Smith stressed Labour would take a ""pragmatic approach"" to managing the economy, with spending tailored to what the economy could bear. 

  And while the tools of that pragmatism would include credit controls - through French-style regulation of bank reserves - they wouldn't involve a devaluation of the currency.  Smith emphasized Labour wants the stability entry into the full European Monetary System (EMS) would provide the pound and doesn't foresee the need to tinker with its value once inside the EMS. 

  ""We may have to be patient about some our social ambitions until we get the economy on a sound footing,"" Smith said.  ""I don't want to initiate spending programs that then have to be cut back."" 

  Labour ""now takes control of inflation extremely seriously,"" Smith says, and would seek to keep it at ""roughly the average of European Community countries"" as part of its efforts to improve effect on Britain's competitiveness. However, he called Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's call for zero inflation ""pie in the sky."" 

  Smith confirmed Labour's support for taking the pound into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the EMS to help ensure the country's economic recovery.  And while he called a devaluation of an ERM-anchored pound undesirable, he wasn't prepared to say at what level sterling should enter.

  BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -AP- Argentina has made a $40 million payment to foreign creditors, the first since foreign debt payments were suspended more than two years ago, government officials said today. 

  Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, confirmed that payments had been renewed following ""arduous"" discussions in New York between Central Bank Vice President Javier Gonzalez Fraga and individual creditor banks. 

  The payment, ministry sources said, is considered ""a gesture of good will"" aimed at aiding Gonzalez Fraga in talks scheduled to began this week with a consortium of private creditors. 

  Argentina, the developing world's third largest debtor, owes a total of $60 billion in loans plus unpaid interest that could reach $8.5 billion by the end of the year. 

  Ministry sources said the government hopes to negotiate an agreement to pay $300 million in overdue interest by the end of the year.  The creditors reportedly have sought payment of $500 million. 

  In the event negotiators reach agreement, Argentina would make another interest payment of between $70 million and $80 million, ministry sources said. 

  The 11-month-old government of President Carlos Menem is seeking debt forgiveness, approval for debt capitalization and new loans. 

  Negotiations with a steering committee that represents private banks, which are owed a total of $40 billion, are likely to be difficult.  Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, for example, reportedly has written off 40% of its loans to Argentina as uncollectable and resents having done so. 

  Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund has indicated it approves of Menem's policy of budget austerity and privatizations, and recently unblocked payment of a $1.7 billion loan granted last October and suspended five months later. 

  Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, said $240 million of the unblocked funds ""have already entered the country"" and that a new installment of the same amount would be disbursed by early August. 

  Argentina is emerging from two bouts of hyperinflation and is mired in recession.  Inflation, which hit 96% in March, dropped to 11% in April but is expected to be slightly higher for May.

  FRANKFURT -DJ- West German chemical group BASF AG said group sales in the first half of 1990 are indicated to have eased by 4 pc from a year earlier to 23.6 billion marks. 

  BASF said parent company sales in the first half slipped 5 

pc from the year-ago level to   11.05 billion marks. 

  But, in remarks prepared for delivery at the company's annual meeting, Chairman Hans Albers repeated that he is confident that the company will be able to match last year's earnings levels. 

  In 1989, BASF's net profit rose 43 pc from the previous year to 2.02 billion marks, while pretax profit was up 17.7 pc to 4.39 billion marks. 

  The first-half sales decline was attributed to the negative impact of the strong Deutsche mark against other currencies, especially the dollar, and to downward price pressures for some product sectors. 

  Albers said sales of the company's plastics division in money terms did not reach last year's levels in the first half of the year despite higher sales volume.  Earnings for the  sector also were lower than those of a year earlier, he added. 

  Selling prices in the company's chemicals sector and parts of its consumer products business also have been under pressure, Albers said, although prices for feedstocks, energy and agrochemicals have been ""pleasingly stable."" 

  He said there continues to be strong customer demand for BASF's consumer products, notably the company's line of pharamceutical. 

  And sales of colors, dyes and finishing product lines expanded during the first half in Europe and improved ""somewhat"" on last year's financial result, Albers said without being more specific. 

  He added that the company's information systems business has had ""clearly higher"" first half sales, although earnings have ""not been keeping pace everywhere."" 

  Albers said he expects the magnetic tape operations be more competative following the acquisition of most of Bayer AG's Agfa-Gevaert AG tape cassette operations. 

  BASF didn't disclose complete half-year financial data, which will be made public at a later date.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- A Federal Reserve Board official told Congress that the Fed is ""mindful of, and sensitive to,"" concerns of a credit crunch. 

  William Taylor, staff director, division of banking supervision and regulation, told the House Banking Committee that the Fed ""has been watching for evidence that would validate these concerns.""

  ""Prices in various segments of the real estate market will be affected, and managers of lending institutions will have to monitor carefully the potential impact on their institutions' loan portfolios."" 

  Taylor said that in their lending activities, ""bank lenders will have to place greater emphasis on a property's cash-generating capacity under prevailing market conditions and less on the assumption or expectation of continually rising real estate prices. 

  ""While creating difficulties in the short-run, this adjustment process is necessary if the economy and financial institutions are to be in a position to respond adequately to future growth opportunities,"" he said.

  Even though the steel industry as a whole will ship less in 1990 - about 80 million tons compared to 84 million in 1989 - the drop is considered relatively small.  Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman Walter F.  Williams noted in a Dow Jones interview that the industry shipped around 100 million tons in 1980 and two years later was only shipping 62 million tons. 

  ""The industry is more stable now,"" he said, as more efficient steelmakers have slashed capacity and costs.  He believes the industry will continue to ship around 80 million tons in the foreseeable future, with a possible low of 75 million tons and a high of about 83 million tons.  ""That's a heck of a lot better than a swing of 40 million tons,"" he said. 

  As a result, although Wall Street views steel as a cyclical, unglamorous industry, he believes investors look more favorably on it than they did five years ago.  Still, the industry must do more.  ""My big fear is people thinking that the job is done.  This isn't the time to get complacent,"" he said. 

  Williams said prices seem to have stabilized and are on the upswing as steelmakers try to pass on higher raw material and operating expenses, including labor costs associated with a four-year contract negotiated last year with United Steelworkers of America.  Bethlehem and other major steelmakers have upped the cost of key cold and hot rolled sheet effective with July 1 shipments. 

  ""I think we've sort of hit the bottom in pricing,"" he said. 

  One potentially huge market for steelmakers is rebuilding the country's long-neglected infrastructure.  Williams believes that improvements to the country's bridges, roads, airports, sewers and industrial plants are not only inevitable, but imperative for America to remain competitive. The problem is financing. 

  ""I'm saying it's necessary and we need to find a way to do it,"" he said.  Some large industrial companies are already taking steps.  Williams noted that a large unnamed plate fabricator is booked through 1990 with orders to build tanks for a chemical company whose storage facilities had not been updated for years.

  EAST BERLIN -AP- A metalworkers union that held a series of strikes in the past few weeks reached an agreement with East German factories that raises their salaries and shortens their working hours. 

  After a 47-hour negotiation session, the IG Metall reached an agreement on wages and working conditions early today, the East German news agency ADN reported.  According to the terms of the accord, workers will receive a pay raise of 250 Deutsche marks per month retroactive to July 1 and their work week will be reduced from the current 43 hours to 40 hours at the latest by October.  The union had requested 400 marks per month more. 

  East German metal workers earn about 1,200 marks per month, or about a third of what their West German counterparts earn. 

  Layoffs will be made effective only after June 30, 1991, ADN reported, and workers dismissed before that point will receive 80 pc to 90 pc of their current wages and reduced time pay.  They will also be entitled to retraining benefits. 

  Annual vacations were set at a minimum of 20 days, or four weeks. 

  The head of the employers' group in the negotiations, Lothar Heinzmann, said that the agreement was ""by itself economically not justifiable,"" according to ADN.  He added that it was ""an advance payment for an uncertain future."" 

  He said that many companies don't know how they are going to pay for the additional wage costs.  lso, the agreements in other branches had elevated the expectations of the metal and electic industry workers and the metal employers couldn't ""detach themselves from the general salary developments."" 

  The metalworkers, meanwhile, claimed a victory and said they had prevented the burdens arising from the transition to the free market economy in East Germany landing ""fully on the workers."" 

  In recent weeks, some 300,000 metalworkers in the Berlin and Brandenburg region went on a series of brief ""warning strikes.""  East German workers are feeling the squeeze from the sharply higher basic food prices since the start of monetary union with West Germany July 1.

32,"Pioneer Hi-Bred Expects To Report Record Fiscal 3Q Earns

 
   By Scott Kilman 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  DES MOINES, Iowa -DJ- Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. expects to report tomorrow that it generated record fiscal third quarter earnings and that its closely watched market share of North American corn seed sales probably rose for the first time in three years, Thomas N. Urban, chairman and president, told Dow Jones. 

  The projection indicates, however, that net income for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31 will probably slip. 

  The record net income for the third quarter will be partially offset by a record loss for the first six months of the year. What's more, the results for the 1989 fiscal year include a gain on the sale of an equity interest in an animal vaccine business. 

  Pioneer, the nation's largest agricultural seed concern, believes that it controls about 35.5% of corn seed sold in North America, up about 1.3 percentage points from the 1989 planting season, Urban said. Corn is the biggest U.S.  crop. 

  Pioneer's market share increased amid less-than-expected sales gains for the U.S. seed industry. An unusually wet spring delayed many farmers from planting corn for so long that they switched to other crops or abandoned their fields. 

  Urban wouldn't disclose how much Pioneer's North American corn seed sales increased in the 1990 planting season other than to say sales ""are up significantly."" 

  According to industry analysts and competitors, Pioneer did everything from cut prices to give away free bags of seed in order to stop the erosion of its market share. 

  Urban, however, said the market share rebound was the pay off from the company's reorganization of its sales force three years ago. ""I think we are better sales people,"" he said. 

  A slightly higher-than-normal amount of seed was given to farmers as free samples because the company introduced a large number of new hybrid seed products, he said. 

  Pioneer's sales strategy is increasingly based on introducing a large number of new hybrids. This year, the company offered 22 new hybrids to farmers. Another 17 new hybrids are being grown by the company for sale next year. 

  ""We are into a new era,"" Pioneer Chairman Urban said. ""We will be introducing new hybrids at a rapid pace on a regular basis."" 

  Urban wouldn't predict the earnings for the third quarter ended May 31 that the company expects to report Friday. 

  Wall Street estimates that the company will report fiscal third quarter net income from continuing operations per share of between $4.54 and $4.70 ""isn't a bad range,"" Urban said. ""It will be the best third quarter we have ever had."" 

  In the same 1989 quarter, Pioneer reported income from continuing operations of $114.6 million, or $3.59 a share, on sales of $608.1 million.  Income from discontinued operations of $605,000 made final net income $115.2 million, or $3.61 a share. 

  Much of Pioneer's business is generated in the fiscal third quarter, which is when most of its customers pay for the seed they ordered for spring planting. Some other seed companies record their sales earlier in the season when they deliver seed to their dealers. 

  Despite a record third quarter, the company's results for the full year ending Aug. 31 will be held back by a loss of $51.8 million, or $1.66 a share, generated during the first six months of the fiscal year. 

  At the same time, the company's 1989 results were inflated by a gain from the sale of its equity interest in a vaccine maker. The sale of the interest in the Agrion operation contributed 27 cents a share to the company's net income from continuing operations of $81.9 million, or $2.58 a share. Income from discontinued operations of $16.3 million made final net income $98.2 million, or $3.09 a share, for fiscal 1989.

  NEW YORK -DJ- Bear Stearns & Co.  analysts expect short- and long-term U.S. interest rates in the 7-7 1/2% range by yearend. 

  Writing in the firm's latest ""Global Spectator,"" the analysts say, ""Provided that fiscal policy mistakes don't stand in the way, stock prices should rise substantially. Low tax-rates, inflation rates and interest rates are the best medicine for the economy."" 

  Currently, the Treasury's bellwether 8 3/4s of 2020 yield 8.41%. 

  The Bear Stearns analysts say the Federal Reserve's shift from a 4-5% inflation to a 2% or less inflation target is ""causing some temporary economic discomfort. The price stability regime imposed by the Fed has put downward pressure on profit margins and this is forcing major cost reduction everywhere. 

  ""But the current adjustment process will generate much, much less discomfort than the early 1980's shift from 15% inflation to 4-5 pc."" 

  The analysts said, ""At the end of the road lies much lower interest rates which, before long, will stimulate faster economic activity. Predicted on our second half inflation forecast of 2% for the PPI and 3% for the CPI, we expect short- and long-term interest rates in the 7-7 1/2% range by yearend.""

34,"June Consumption Rebound Bodes Well For 3rd Qtr GNP

 
   By Laurence Bauman 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- The rise in June personal consumption expenditures is seen as a sign that consumer spending may be on the rebound, following an exceptionally weak second quarter. 

  Personal consumption expenditures in June rose 1%, compared with unchanged expenditures in May and a 0.2% increase in April, the Commerce Department reported.  The monthly PCE data are not adjusted for inflation. 

  The second quarter gross national product report showed that PCE declined at an annual rate of about 0.3% in the period, on an inflation-adjusted basis. 

  ""The pattern of consumption suggests that spending on durables and services in June were moderately stronger than in April and May,"" says Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. 

  ""The weakness was concentrated in April and May, while in June there was a little bounceback,"" adds Platt.  ""That suggest that consumption won't be a drag in the third quarter, although it does not suggest any robustness."" 

  The rise in June PCE ""provides a decent ramp into the third quarter,"" says James Fralick, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.  ""If the trend can be maintained, we should get some decent growth"" in the third quarter. 

  Personal income in June was up 0.4%, following 0.3% increases in both April and May. 

  The key wages and salery component of income was up 0.5% in month, compared with May's 0.4% rise. 

  Fralick terms the increase in personal income as ""a normal kind of growth."" 

  But Platt says that the recent weakness seen in the monthly payroll data suggest that ""the income side will be rather sluggish, and, in a few months, will contribute to another downturn in consumption."" 

  He says that currently, a major reason consumer spending is weak is that ""prices are too high.  Store owners are experiencing consumer resistance,"" and will eventually have to cut prices in order to clear off their shelves.

  Burns Fry Ltd. said recent signs of a softening economy and improving inflation justify the recent drop in the bank rate and ""makes the case for further declines.""  It noted that the M2 monetary aggregate, the money supply figure most closely watched by the central bank, grew at an annual rate of 4.9 pc in the six months ended in June compared to a rate of 17 pc in January.  M2 includes currency and net demand deposits plus personal savings deposits and non-personal notice deposits. 

  Burns Fry said demand for household credit, which grew at a rate of 14.5 pc in June, and some generous wage settlements reduced the prospects for significant interest rate declines. 

  ""The strong dollar, weaker growth and the more favorable tone in the U.S.  money markets give the Bank of Canada the flexibility to shift to a more accommodative policy stance,"" said Bank of Nova Scotia economist David Rosenberg.  The central bank, however, is likely to resist any sharp declines in short-term rates because of its continuing concern with high wage gains.  ""The central bank remains concerned that the run-up in wage settlements will reverse the recent moderation in consumer price trends,"" Rosenberg said. 

  Gerard MacDonell, a Royal Bank of Canada economist, said the dollar, which was pushed higher last week because of declines in U.S. short-term interest rates, may come under some selling pressure tomorrow after Statistics Canada reports its survey of revised capital spending intentions for 1990.  MacDonell said that, while financial markets are expecting the Canadian dollar to reach 87c (U.S.), a weak spending intentions report could ""damage the Canadian dollar by provoking speculation of a rapid cut in Canadian short-term interest rates."" 

  Michael Gregory, another Royal Bank economist, predicted that the revised capital spending intentions figure would be down significantly from the 7.4-pc increase forecast in the March survey.  Gregory said a strong Canadian dollar, declining profitability and lower equity prices and capacity utilization rates indicate the revised investment figure will show about a 2-pc increase.

36,"CPI Data Show Inflation Ignoring Recession Talk

 
   By Kevin Donovan 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Inflation hasn't gotten the word about the tottering economy. 

  The consumer price index in July rose 0.4%, the Labor Department reported this morning. The CPI component excluding food and energy, the so-called core rate of inflation, was up an alarming 0.6% in the month. 

  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists had looked for a 0.3% rise in the CPI and for a similar rise without the food and energy components. 

  Inflation reports in the next few months are likely to show sizable increases because of the rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 

  Labor said the July CPI report didn't reflect the impact of the Mideast crisis. In fact, consumer energy prices were down 0.7% in July. 

  ""It underscores the fact inflation is not going to vanish meekly from the scene despite all the clamor about a soft economy,"" says Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. 

  Roach says his calculations show core inflation up at a 5.9% annual rate through the first seven months of 1990, compared with a 4.7% rate for the first seven months in 1989. 

  ""The sharp rise in core inflation reflects an economy that is clearly sending some ominous signals ... even before we deal with a full-blown energy crisis,"" he says. 

  John Williams, economist at Bankers Trust Co., says, ""The way to explain it, is it's alarming."" 

  ""When you consider that energy prices were down in this report and when you consider that's not likely to happen again soon, the prospects for inflation are not very rosy at the moment,"" Williams says. 

  The consumer price index for July continues to show the difficulty in reining in medical costs, which are more or less impervious to supply and demand forces. 

  Medical costs showed the sharpest rise among major CPI components in July, leaping 0.9% after rising 0.7% in June and 0.8% in May. 

  ""We've got to find a way to get a handle on medical costs,"" says Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. 

  Stone says much of the increase in the July CPI may be the result of higher local taxes, and thus may represent a one-time surge in the inflation rate. 

  ""It looks like some sales tax increases got to us in here, so that many of these items suffered a one-shot surge in prices,"" she says. ""The surge in tobacco prices is a case in point."" 

  Tobacco-price increases due to tax hikes accounted for a large part of the increase in the ""other"" category of CPI. Tobacco prices, which were up 2.7% in July, account for about 1.5% of the CPI index. 

  In addition, new hotel room taxes may have accounted for the rise in ""other renters' costs"" that helped boost the housing category 0.5% in July, Stone says. 

  Noting that apparel prices and automobile prices fell in the month, she says the overall CPI increase was ""sharp but it wasn't pervasive."" 

  Nevertheless, ""inflation is jumping to center stage,"" says Morgan Stanley's Roach. 

  He says CPI inflation surged in the first quarter of 1990, followed by a ""breathing spell"" in the seocnd quarter.  Now it may be heating up again. 

  The confluence of the Persian Gulf crisis and a robust inflation reading could well freeze monetary policy, says Bankers Trust's Williams. 

  ""The markets know that the Fed is as uncertain about the future as the rest of us are,"" he says, and would probably deem any bold move in changing policy foolish. 

  ""Don't just do something, sit there,"" might be the Fed's only choice, he says.

37,"Oil Company Stocks Lower -2-

 

  Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.  analyst Michael Young tells Dow Jones Professional Investor Report oil prices above $30 a barrel are counterproductive both to the oil stocks prospects and the broader market as well. 

  On the morning call today to clients and brokers, Young said it was time to take profits in the oil patch.  ""Oil stocks can't continue to go up if the market continues to go down,"" he said. 

  In particular, Young downgraded British Petroleum Co.  to ""hold"" from ""buy"" on a price basis, noting the stock is up 27% in the third quarter alone. 

  Smith Barney also removed Amerada Hess Corp. and Amoco Corp. from its Investment Policy Committe buy list. 

  At current prices, both companies are showing relatively weaker dividend yields, says Young.  Amerada Hess's closing price yesterday gives a 1.2% yield versus 3.2% for the domestic oil companies, and Amoco's 3.5% yield compares unfavorably with a 4.5% average yield for the major oils, he says. 

  Young adds that if $30-a-barrel oil were here to stay, it doesn't have positive implications for oil demand growth. It would foster alternative energy demand, particularly natural gas, he says. 

  The Smith Barney analyst sees oil prices remaining above their levels of six weeks ago but dropping back to the low twenties in the event of a diplomatic or peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis. 

  Should the stalemate continue, Young expects oil prices will stabilize at about $28 a barrel, but hit $40 a barrel in the event of war. 

  First Boston analyst William Randol, however, is bullish on the oil stocks both short and long term, based on his belief that things ""are going to get ugly"" in the Middle East. 

  Randol says he's recommending clients aggressively purchase the major oils, both for the short and long term. 

  There could be a 3 million-barrel-a-day crude oil shortage in the fourth quarter, with the crude oil winter needs rising to 24.5 million barrels daily from the current 21.5 million, he says. 

  With Saudi Arabia and Venezuela struggling to make up for the oil that used to come from Iraq and Kuwait, he wonders where the oil is going to come from. 

  Kidder Peabody & Co. analyst William Brown tells Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the broader market decline is hurting the oil stocks today. 

  ""People are just afraid of everything right now,"" and the oil stocks have no immunity to it today, he says. 

  However, Brown told Kidder, Peabody's sale force and clients this morning to remain overweighted in oil stocks and not give in to the selling pressure. 

  Though OPEC is trying to raise production, a major correction in oil prices - barring a diplomatic or peaceful breakthrough in the Middle East - isn't foreseen, he said. 

  Even if Saudi Arabia and Venezuela pick up the Iraq-Kuwait slack in oil production, there will still be a shortfall of some 500,000 barrels a day from the pre-invasion production levels, Brown estimates. 

  While there may be a ""pause"" in the oil stocks' stellar absolute performance of recent weeks, Brown expects oil stocks to continue to outperform the broader market on a relative basis. 

  The analyst says the following companies are particularly leveraged to the price of oil when compared to competitors: Royal Dutch Petroleum, Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum, and Amoco Corp.

  FRANKFURT -DJ- The dollar's decline in currency markets should be more gradual than the sharp drop registered thus far this week, said Claus Koehler, a Bundesbank director. 

  ""The tempo has been disturbed and that could mean a upward correction is possible.  A more gradual dollar decline would be better,"" Koehler told journalists. 

  Koehler noted that the fundamental attractiveness in the Deutsche mark, which has been soaring against the dollar, lies in the lower inflation rate in West Germany than in other countries, including the U.S. 

  West German inflation currently is running at around an annual rate of 2.3 pc, about half of the U.S level. 

  Koehler said the inflation difference should be seen as a more important indicator of the mark's underlying firmness against the dollar than interest rate differentials. 

  Koehler also noted that at the moment the markets are weighing the ""success"" of the German monetary union against the ongoing crisis in the U.S.  savings and loan industry. 

  Koehler also said he doesn't see any destabilizing influence on the European Monetary System from the German unification and the transfer of resources from West to East Germany. 

  He said the recent record high current account surpluses being posted by West Germany almost certainly will be cut back in the future as the Germanys boost imports as part of the reconstruction of the East German economy. 

  Koehler also strongly rejected the proposal made several weeks ago by Great Britain to establish a hard pan-European currency as a parallel to existing monetary units in the European Community.  ""We absolutely don't subscribe to the idea of a parallel currency. Who would regulate it.  It would only create new problems,"" Koehler remarked.

41,"Aug Sales, PPI Data Seen Giving Fed Room To Ease

 
   By Laurence Bauman and Kevin Donovan 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporters 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- The decline in August retail sales and the moderate increase in the core rate of producer price inflation are seen increasing the chances of an easing of monetary policy. 

  As expected, the rise in oil prices distorted both reports.  But the increase in energy costs is a factor well beyond the control of Fed policy makers, and so analysts say the data will be viewed in terms of their underlying trends, which reflect weak economic activity and moderate inflation. 

  Retail sales in August were down 0.6 pc, compared with an 0.4 pc increase in the previous month. But August gasoline station sales, sparked by a rise in gas prices, rose 6.4 pc, without which retail sales were down 1.1 pc. 

  The producer price index was up 1.3 pc in August, in line with market expectations.  Without food and energy prices, PPI was up 0.3 pc in August. 

  If the Federal Reserve is poised to ease monetary policy, the two economic reports will leave them ""that much more inclined,"" says Raymond Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. 

  The 1.3 pc increase in the overall PPI ""is not good news, but the PPI is not as bad as it could have been,"" when food and energy costs are factored out, and ""retail sales were clearly weak,"" says Stone. 

  The retail sales report ""was a pretty weak number, and the Fed should probably respond to the weakness in the economy,"" says Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. 

  He says the Fed ""is close to easing,"" but is probably waiting for a budget agreement before pushing short-term rates lower. 

  The bond market is lower on the day, but the losses reflect overnight declines on Mideast concerns. Bond prices are little changed since the PPI and retail sales reports at 8:30 a.m.  EDT. 

  The Treasury's 8 3/4 pc 30-year bellwether bond is down 10/32 from Tuesday's close at 97 13/32 to yield 8.99 pc, while Treasury bill rates are down one basis point.

42,"Haussmann Says High Oil Price To Cut German Growth Slightly

 

  BONN -DJ- Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann played down the negative impact higher oil prices could have on West German economic growth, but said a rend toward higher monthly price increases could accelerate in September. 

  Haussmann said in a statement that, if oil prices remain at $25 to $28 a barrel, ""this would for the rest of the year mean a reduction in growth of a few tenths of a percentage point."" 

  The West German economy is expected to grow about 4 pc in 1990, after a similar rate of expansion in 1989. 

  Haussmann predicted a more apparent effect on consumer prices, which he said were already boosted ""noticeably"" by higher energy prices in August.  The preliminary cost of living rose 2.9 pc from a year earlier in August, up from a July year-to-year rise of only 2.4 pc. 

  In September, Haussmann said, ""this trend will continue under the current circumstances."" 

  The economics minister also said West Germany's trade balance will be affected by the rise in oil prices.  But he added that, with West Germany's continued high trade and current account surpluses, a rise in the nation's oil import bill would be manageable without the need for any offsetting action. 

  The Federal Statistics Office reported earlier this week that Europe's largest economy grew an inflation-adjusted 3.9 pc in first half compared with a year earlier. 

  The strength of the D-mark, which cuts the dollar-denominated price of oil for West Germany, is also a positive factor, Haussmann said.

43,"Brazilian Oil Workers Accept Pay Raise, Strike Averted

 

  RIO DE JANEIRO -AP- Oil workers called off a nationwide strike and met to vote on a proposed 98 pc pay raise, the state oil company Petrobras and unions said. 

  Petrobras said leaders of all 19 oil workers unions had accepted the company's offer. 

  The National Strike Command in Rio said eight unions had settled and the rest were meeting in assemblies to discuss the proposal. 

  The strike called for yesterday did not occur.  Instead, union and company representatives met to resolve the impasse at the Superior Labor Court in Brasilia, the capital. 

  Strikers demanded a raise of 279 pc to offset losses from inflation, which was 4,274 pc in the past 12 months. 

  The labor court proposed a 104 pc increase, which unions were inclined to accept, court spokesman Cesar Borges said. 

  Petrobras refused to budge from 98 pc but agreed to re-examine the case of employees punished for political motives. 

  The company's position was strengthened by the decision of five unions earlier in the week to accept the 98 pc.  The unions included Brazil's two largest oil refineries, in Campinas and Duque de Caxias. 

  Unions in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Parana and Minas Gerais met late yesterday and voted to take Petrobras' offer. 

  Brazil produces about 60 pc of the 1.1 million barrels of oil it consumes daily.

  CARSON, Calif. -DJ- Nissan said it was raising the base price of most models between 1.7% and 2.7%. However, a big exception is the Sentra, completely redone for this year.  It will start at $7,999, a $600 or 8.1% increase from the current model. 

  Nissan's car and truck sales in the U.S. dropped 4.9% through July 31, making it the only major Japanese auto maker to lose market share this year.  Overall, Japanese car makers took a record 28% of the U.S.  car market in the first half of 1990. 

  Nissan released prices on all of its models except for the upscale Maxima. The base price of the 1991 Nissan Stanza will be $11,900, a 2.1% increase from 1990. The Nissan 240SX will start at $13,609, a 2.7% rise. 

  Nissan lowered the base price of its 300ZX sports car to $27,300 from $28,600, a decrease of 4.5%. However, the company eliminated the car's standard ""T-bar"" roof, which now must be purchased as an option. With the T-bar roof the car now costs $29,100, a 1.7% increase from 1990. 

  The Nissan Pathfinder sports utility vehicle will have a base price of $16,120, a 2.5% increase. The cheapest Pathfinder with four-wheel drive will be $17,695, a 2.3% increase.

45,"Schlesinger Says West Should Avoid Easy Credit To E Europe

 

  LONDON -DJ- Western industrialized nations should avoid ""easy credit"" to Eastern Europe and focus on maintaining currency stability to help the region's shift toward market-based economies, Deutsche Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger said. 

  Schlesinger, speaking at a London conference on global monetary developments and policy, added that Western industrialized nations must also ""create the preconditions for a non-inflationary transfer of resources to the countries of Eastern Europe in the next few years"" by eliminating interest rate subsidies, liberalizing financial markets and by opening markets generally to free trade. 

  ""A policy of easy money in the industrial countries would be of no assistance to the capital-importing countries"" of Eastern Europe since that would only serve to fuel inflation, he said. 

  Schlesinger said easy credit ""would push up interest rates and ultimately also lead to higher real interest rates which would be undesirable with respect to a steady growth of the economy."" 

  The Bundesbank official stressed industrial nations could most help reforms in Eastern Europe by maintaining ""the stability of those currencies which the Eastern European countries use for their international transactions."" 

  ""International monetary policy can contribute indirectly to promoting the transfer of resources by working toward as stable a monetary environment as possible so as to make sure that exchange rate risks remain small and distortions of the competitive position due to monetary developments are avoided,"" he said. 

  ""The be-all and end-all of a stable environment is price stability,"" Schlesinger said. 

  Schlesinger reaffirmed the Bundesbank's commitment to currency stability and added that ""Success in the unification process in Germany, while safeguarding monetary stability, is probably in the interests of all our European neighbors, in the East and in the West alike."" 

  Deutsche Bundesbank Vice Chairman Schlesinger said he doesn't ""see any danger for a devaluation of the d-mark in the future,"" although he also declined to elaborate on exactly what time frame was involved. 

  He did, however, note that current estimates indicated growth next year will be somewhere between 3 pc and 3.5 pc, including the impact of higher world oil prices. 

  As well, with chances for steady interest rates the mark is likely to remain robust ""on average"" against the world's major currencies, Schlesinger maintained. 

  Inflation, he added, may touch 3 pc in the near term from current levels around 2.8 pc to 2.9 pc.  But the Bundesbank official stressed that tight monetary policies would remain intact and that he didn't envision German inflation growing much. 

  With the cost of German unification expected to mount, Schlesinger added tax increases would be ""a last resort."" But he noted that the government is also weighing cuts in expenditures, particularly those designed as subsidies. 

  And while ""presumably this is not enough,"" another option to offset the costs of financing economic reforms in East Germany is also capital market borrowing, he said. 

  On Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, Schlesinger was cautious, saying that ""It's not really the position of the Bundesbank to decide on sterling and the ERM.  It is a question on when the U.K. can come in.  But the U.K.  has to decide when."" 

  Sterling fell sharply last Friday on reports that Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl suggested Britain shouldn't enter given its high inflation rate. 

  Schlesinger rejected that suggestion. But he said the ERM timing for the pound ""is complicated.""

46,"Shell Canada Earnings -2-

 

  The company said oil products earnings increased to C$69 million from C$10 million in the third quarter due to higher sales volumes and firmer sales margins resulting from stable retail market conditions and improved refinery operations. Resources earnings were C$33 million for the third quarter, compared with a loss of C$7 million a year earlier.  The improvement was the result of higher sales prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids due to recent events in the Persian Gulf, higher sales volumes for all products, in particular natural gas and natural gas liquids, and lower exploration expenses. Chemicals earnings improved to C$16 million from C$10 million, primarily due to higher styrene margins. 

  Resources performance is expected to remain strong for the rest of the year if current crude oil prices are sustained. 

  Capital and exploration spending in the nine months fell to C$415 million from C$537 million. It said resource spending was lower than anticipated due to delays in the commencement of Caroline development.  Oil Products spending of C$94 million included C$58 million for improvements to the retail network and C$36 million for manufacturing projects. 

  The company, which issued C$150 million of debt earlier this month for general corporate purposes, said further funding may be needed before year-end for working capital requirements if crude oil prices remain at current levels. 

  Corporate expenses were C$55 million for the nine months, up from C$20 million a year earlier. It said expenses increased as a result of the second-quarter pre-tax provision of C$45 million for the costs of restructuring.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- U.S.  producer prices of finished goods rose a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in September, or at a 20.9% compounded annual rate, the Labor Department said. 

  The latest increase compared with a rise of an adjusted 1.3%, or 16.4% at a compounded annual rate, in August and a fall of 0.1%, or 1.0% at a compounded annual rate, in July. 

  So far in calendar 1990, the PPI has risen at a 6.3% compounded annual rate. 

  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report survey of 17 economists published Wednesday found an average estimate of a 1.3% rise in September producer prices. 

  The producer price index for finished goods showed that prices of consumer foods fell an adjusted 0.9% last month after rising an adjusted 0.8% in July. 

  Last month's PPI, less the volatile food and energy components, increased an adjusted 0.6% after rising 0.3% the month before. Capital equipment costs rose an adjusted 0.8% after rising 0.3%. 

  Energy prices rose 13.8% in September, compared with a 9.5% rise the prior month. 

  Before seasonal adjustment, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose 0.9% last month to 120.3% of the 1982 average and stood 5.9% ahead of the index reading a year earlier. 

  The PPI for intermediate goods, which have had some processing, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.8% last month after increasing an adjusted 1.3% in the preceding month. Before seasonal adjustment, this index rose 1.7% and stood at 116.3% of its 1982 average, up 3.5% from a year earlier. 

  The PPI for crude goods rose a seasonally adjusted 4.6% last month after increasing an adjusted 9.3% in the preceding month. Before seasonal adjustment, this index rose 4.4% and stood at 115.1% of its 1982 average, up 12.5% from a year earlier. 

  The 13.8% increase in September energy prices is the largest recorded since the Labor Department began tracking producer prices, a Labor official said. The second largest monthly increase occurred in January, when energy prices moved up 13.7%. 

  As reported, both the gasoline and home heating oil indexes climbed more than 20% in September. In addition, the index for natural gas increased 1.3% after falling 9.4% in August, Labor said. 

  Food prices, meanwhile, moved down 0.9% after increasing 0.8% in August.  Prices fell in September for beef and veal, eggs, fresh vegetables, shortening and pasta.  Prices for dairy products and pork also fell in September, Labor said. 

  As reported in the intermediate goods category, prices rose 1.8% in September following a 1.3% increase in August. As was the case in August, the energy component contributed to much of the increase. 

  Nondurable manufacturing materials, for example, jumped 2.0% in September after rising 0.1% in August.  The acceleration was dominated by a strong increase in petrochemical prices, Labor said. 

  The index for crude goods, meanwhile, increased 4.6% in September after a 9.3% rise in August. The increase in prices for crude energy materials slowed to 12.4% following a 25.5% increase in August. Crude petroleum prices moved up 20.4%, down considerably from the 62.5% increase in August, Labor said.

49,"Mieno Says Dollar Is Falling Too Quickly Against The Yen

 

  TOKYO -DJ- Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said the dollar is falling too quickly against the yen, despite basic factors in the market that appear to support the currency. 

  Mieno, speaking at a regularly scheduled press conference, wouldn't name an appropriate level for the dollar and noted that the market is still striving to adjust to the fight over the U.S. budget and weakening business conditions in the U.S. 

  Failure by the U.S. Congress to agree on a tentative plan to cut the fiscal deficit and increasingly gloomy economic statistics are behind the dollar's recent decline, Mieno said. 

  But he added that the market apparently doesn't think it will be dominated by dollar selling because of U.S. efforts to cut the deficit, the Federal Reserve's anti-inflationary stance and uncertainties surrounding the Persian Gulf situation.  Nonetheless, traders are pushing the currency down a bit too quickly, he asserted. 

  Mieno said that the stronger yen lessens inflationary pressures within the Japanese economy.  But the economy's tendency toward inflation still requires vigilance on the part of the Bank of Japan. Currently, the central bank doesn't intend to change its monetary policy and is watching the effects of the last discount rate rise on Aug. 30. 

  Mieno observed that Tokyo stock prices have recovered slightly since the Ministry of Finance announced measures Oct.  1 to support the market.  He repeated his position that a central bank governor shouldn't comment on the appropriate level for stock prices. 

  But while Mieno was unwilling to discuss particular levels of stock prices, he said that in any market they should stabilize at a range that reflects the prospects for growth in the economy. 

  Touching on the Ministry of Finance's measures to support the market, Mieno said that comments by Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the beginning of the month reflected the general need to support the stock market rather than initiatives in monetary policy. 

  Hashimoto said Oct. 1 that monetary policy should be directed to stabilize the market, remarks that led some to speculate of a clash between the Bank of Japan and the ministry over formation of policy. 

  Mieno said that, though the drop in the stock market made it more difficult for Japanese banks to meet Bank for International Settlement (BIS) requirements, the BIS requirements aren't just a number to be reached but are meant to make banks financially sound. 

  He said even though the stock market has dropped, banks still have enough time to meet the BIS standards before the March 1993 deadline. By then, banks must have capital equal to 8 pc of their risk-weighted assets, although by March of next year, the interim ratio must be 7.25 pc.

  LONDON -DJ- British producer output prices, or prices of manufactured goods, rose 0.4% in September from August, while producer input prices, or prices of raw materials and fuels purchased by manufacturing industry, rose an unadjusted 2.2% in September from August, the U.K. Central Statistical Office said.

  (1985 equals 100.0) 

  Market forecasters had expected output price rises to accelerate slightly to 0.3% while input prices were predicted to jump by 1.5% on the month, reflecting both sharp increases in oil prices and some non-oil commodity costs. 

  The statistical office said fuel costs effectively accounted for the September rise in input prices on an adjusted and unadjusted basis. 

  After seasonal adjustment, input prices rose 2.2% in September from August and were up 0.3% from September 1989. This compares with August's revised 1.0% monthly rise and 0.8% yearly fall. The adjusted August data was previously reported as an 0.9% monthly rise and a 1.0% yearly fall. 

  The office noted that seasonally adjusted input prices registered their highest month-on-month increase since October 1976 when the monthly rise amounted to 3.3%. 

  After seasonal adjustment, the index of input prices was at 105.4 in September, up from a revised 103.1 in August and up from 105.1 in September 1989.  The August index was previously reported at 103.0.

  The Fed has eased policy twice this fall, permitting the Federal Funds rate to fall 50 basis points to a target of 7 1/2 pc. 

  Fed Chairman Greenspan's reluctance to embrace the need for further easing doesn't mean another step won't be taken before the year is out. 

  ""The ball is in the court of the next important batch of data - employment, the producer price index and the consumer price index,"" says Karydakis of First National Bank of Chicago. 

  If the November employment report and the November inflation readings are weak, the stage will be set for the Federal Open Market Committee to vote for easier policy when it meets Dec.  18, he says. 

  Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Brothers, says Greenspan's ""description of the economy is as weak as the rest of us are talking about.  There's a recognition on the part of the Fed things are weak."" 

  Slifer says that the upcoming economic data on November will show a continued deterioration of the economy. 

  He sees non-farm payrolls down at least 50,000, the unemployment rate up 0.2 pcage point, industrial production down 0.6 pc and relatively tame inflation numbers. 

  ""It leads me to expect that the Fed will ease at the FOMC meeting, if not before, should they get a very weak November employment report,"" Slifer says. 

  He says the Fed may consider lowering reserve requirements, which would free up about $12.5 billion in reserves. The impact, he adds, will be muted when Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  premiums go up in January. But those premiums are going up regardless, so a cut in required reserves ""would reduce the pain."" 

  ""The next important piece of information is the employment report.  If it's as weak as expected, there's no reason for them to sit around until the FOMC meeting, although that's their style,"" Slifer says. 

  Says Karydakis: ""The trademark of the Greenspan Fed is caution and to avoid knee-jerk reactions."" 

  But that doesn't mean another 25 basis point cut in the Funds rate won't be forthcoming before Christmas.

  NEW YORK -DJ- Retail sales are expected to have moved up 0.1 pc in October, according to the average of estimates of 14 economist surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

  A drop in consumer spending has been reflected in the sales of department stores - one of the largest components of the Commerce's Department's monthly retail sales report, analysts say. 

  Economists' forecasts for the Commerce report, due Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. EST, range from one call for a decline of 1.5 pc to one call for a 1.1 gain. 

  The September rise of 1.1 pc followed a 0.4 pc decline in August and a 0.1 pc gain in July. 

  Economists stress that within their estimations, higher gasoline prices offset sluggish consumer spending - which accounts for two-thirds of gross national product - along with weakness in general merchandise and apparel sales. 

  ""The downtick would have been more pronounced had it not been for the gasoline,"" says Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., who estimates a decline of 0.2 pc. 

  The figure, she adds, ""reflects widespread weakness in the economy."" 

  The continuing Persian Gulf crisis caused a surge in energy prices - gasoline prices skyrocketed during the month. 

  Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities Inc., sees retail sales down 0.2 pc. He says that despite a weak economy, firm auto sales prevented a further decline in retail sales. 

  Last month, domestic car sales amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.1 million units, from 6.4 million units a year ago.

   By David J. Jefferson 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  CYPRESS, Calif. -DJ- PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.  will post net income in excess of $5.5 million, or more than 45 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, Wayne Lowell, chief financial officer, told Dow Jones. 

  The earnings are ""slightly ahead"" of industry analysts' expectations that the company would earn between $5 million and $5.5 million, or 41 cents to 45 cents a share, for the quarter, he said. 

  In the year-ago quarter, the operator of health maintenance organizations had net income of $4.1 million, or 36 cents a share.  Revenue climbed to between $260 million and $270 million, from $190.6 million a year ago, he said. 

  Lowell attributed the strong results to increases in both HMO memberships and prices during the past year. Memberships increased 22 pc in 1990 compared to the prior year, and price increases averaged between 10 pc and 20 pc, he said. The company also reduced the amount of hospital services it uses - ""one of our efficiency measures"" - but that was offset by an increase in administrative costs ""related primarily to digesting the growth we've had,"" he said. 

  Given the rate of growth, PacifiCare expects revenue to increase about 20 pc in fiscal 1991, ""and we are hopeful that our bottom line will also grow by 20 pc,"" Lowell said. 

  For the year ended Sept. 30, net income ""slightly exceeded"" analysts' high expectations of $17.4 million, or $1.45 a share, and revenue was between $970 million and $980 million, he said.  Net income for the year included a net gain $1 million, or nine cents a share, from the sale of the company's Austin, Texas, operations. 

  In the prior year, the company had net income of $10.9 million, or 96 cents a share, on revenue of $650.2 million. 

  PacifiCare has HMO operations in Southern California, Oregon, Washington state, Oklahoma and Texas. The company is looking to add a Medicare program in Oklahoma and perhaps expand into Northern California, Lowell said.

  ""The prospects for the service side are very favorable,"" says George Gaspar, an oil service industry analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co. 

  Oil service companies have undergone a major consolidation since drilling activity peaked in the U.S. in 1981.  Gaspar says renewed activity will provide the opportunity for service companies to cease discounting and extend their margins.  He suggests the activity already generated by hostilities in the Persian Gulf is enough to boost service company revenues by 15 pc to 20 pc and earnings by 20 pc to 35 pc. 

  Gaspar expects to see service companies trading at about 17.5 times 1991 earnings. 

  Analysts say most major oil companies now are in the process of calculating their 1991 exploration budgets assuming an oil price in the low $20-a-barrel range.  The real measure of what 1991 will hold for oil service companies will come when major oil companies decide their budgets in the coming weeks. 

  Analysts say even if oil prices drop from the mid-$30s to the low $20s, benefits will accrue to the service industry. 

  The Soviet Union, long one of the world's leading oil producers, has a decaying production infrastructure badly in need of modernization. Even if those repairs don't come immediately, lost Soviet production will have to be replaced elsewhere. 

  Analysts don't see demand for oil abating soon.  So they project instead new production around the world, some of it from the U.S.  How much will be determined by the economics of oil prices. 

  ""I believe the upswing is real,"" Wertheim Schroder's Simpson says.  ""It's going to last a very long time - through most, if not all, of the 90s.""

  FRANKFURT -DJ- Economic imbalances among European Community nations could go uncorrected if the EC tries to fix currency rates as part of its proposed European Monetary Union, a Deutsche Bundesbank official warned today. 

  ""If exchange rate changes are ruled out, authorities lose an important instrument to deal with regional imbalances within the community,"" said Hans Tietmeyer, member of the directorate of the German central bank. 

  Divergences among EC members relate mainly to ""inflationary cost and price trends, excessive budget deficits in some countries and large external imbalances,"" he said, adding that ""deep-seated divergences still remain and are actually widening again in some areas."" 

  The concept of European economic and monetary union, with a European central bank at its center, has ""widespread appeal,"" Tietmeyer said.  But he added that he wanted to highlight the potential risks associated with the proposed European monetary system. 

  The speech, which also reiterated the Bundesbank's position that any European central bank must be independent, was delivered at a seminar sponsored by the International Monetary Fund in Washington.  An advance copy of his prepared speech was made available in Frankfurt.

56,"Group Says Oct. Housing Affordability Index Rises

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Declines in the median home price and average interest rate and an increase in the median family income lifted the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index in October to its highest point in more than two years, the association said. 

  NAR's Housing Affordability Index, which measures the ability of a typical family to purchase a median-priced resale home, was 113.4 in October, up from 110.8 in September. At 113.4, the index shows that a family earning the national median income of $35,353 in October had 113.4 pc of the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 80 pc of a home priced at $92,800, the median existing-home price for that month. 

  The October index rose due to a change in three major components of the purchasing power measurement - the median resale home price, median family income and the average mortgage rate.  Each change had a positive effect on the index last month.  Not since September of 1988, when the index was 113.5, has it been higher than October's reading. And, prior to that, the index had not been higher than 113.4 since December 1977 when it was 116.0. The October increase in the index this year was the greatest since December 1989. 

  ""Objectively, market conditions are excellent, and are at odds with home sales activity,"" said NAR President Harley E. Rouda. ""The missing link is consumer confidence - the housing affordability index indicates that conditions are better than they've been in over two years,"" he said. 

  ""With home prices relatively low right now, and fixed-rate mortgages available at less than 10 pc, the market is ripe for buyers who have been waiting for the best time to buy a home,"" Rouda, the newly elected 1991 NAR president, said. 

  The September index, now estimated at 110.8, previously had been estimated at 110.9. 

  The October median home price of $92,800 is down from a median price of $94,400 in September, according to the Realtors Association.

57,"Analysts See Bank Of Canada Rate Down 25 Points Tomorrow

 
   By Rose Tamburri 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  OTTAWA -DJ- The Bank of Canada's bank rate is expected to decline by about 25 basis points tomorrow from its current level of 12.01 pc, following a decline in the U.S. discount rate yesterday, money-market analysts said. 

  The expected bank rate drop follows a 15-point decline last week and would bring the rate to its lowest level since February 1989. 

  The bank rate is set each week at 25 basis points above the average yield on three-month treasury bills at the Thursday auction.  It is the rate the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions. 

  Canadian money-market rates are sharply lower today partly because of a one-half percentage point cut in the U.S. discount rate to 6.5 pc, said John McCarthy, chief 

money-market dealer at Toronto-Dominion Bank.   The discount rate is the levy the U.S. Federal Reserve Board charges on loans to banks. 

  Michael Gregory, Royal Bank of Canada economist, said lower U.S.  short-term rates will create ""a window for the Bank of Canada"" to allow further declines in Canadian rates. 

  ""We're in a phase of significant rate declines,"" Gregory said.  He predicted that Canadian short-term rates will fall an additional 100 basis points over the next two months because of continuing weakness in the Canadian economy. 

  With U.S. rates also declining, the spread between Canadian and U.S.  short-term rates is expected to remain little changed, keeping the Canadian dollar firm, Gregory said.  At mid-day, the Canadian currency was trading at 86.27c (U.S.). 

  Gregory predicted the decline in Canadian short-term rates would continue until February when the inflationary impact of the government's 7 pc goods and services tax is expected to push up Canada's consumer price index.  Then, the central bank will begin to exercise ""some caution,"" Gregory said. The tax will take effect Jan. 1 and is expected to boost Canada's CPI on a one-time basis by 1.25 percentage points.

58,"Newsprint Prices Seen Weaker As Strikes End In Eastern Cda

 
   By G. Pierre Goad 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  MONTREAL -DJ- The end of lengthy strikes at several large Canadian newsprint mills could effectively wipe out a scheduled Jan. 1 industry-wide newsprint price hike in the U.S. and Canada, analysts and industry executives said. 

  Downward pressure on prices would cheer struggling newspaper publishers and hurt the North American newsprint industry, which is trying gamely to climb out of a cyclical trough. 

  The scheduled newsprint price hike of about 5 pc will probably go through on Jan. 1, analysts and industry executives said.  But after the reopened Canadian mills return to full operations in January, producers will likely have to offer increased discounts from list price or formally roll back the price increase, they said. 

  ""The world is going to be afloat in newsprint,"" said Homer Taylor, vice president, supply at Knight-Ridder Inc. ""I can't imagine how the price increase will go through."" 

  Led by Stone Container Corp., most major North American newsprint producers announced this fall that they would raise the benchmark eastern U.S.  list price to $720 a metric ton from $685.  Prices were raised by similar amounts in other markets.  A metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds. 

  Newsprint producers raised list prices by about 5 pc on June 1, their first increase in more than two years.  They made that price hike stick largely because of the threat of strikes at mills in eastern Canada, many analysts and newsprint buyers argue. 

  Labor negotiations in the eastern Canadian paper industry did turn out to be difficult, and at one point this fall, as much as 15 pc of North American capacity was shut by strikes. Supplies were tight newspaper buyers said, but there weren't any big shortages. 

  This week striking workers at four mills representing about 10 pc of North American capacity signed new labor agreements. 

  Tribune Co. unit Quebec & Ontario Paper's mill at Thorold, Ontario, reopened after a four-month strike. 

  Workers at two big Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. mills, on strike since September and October respectively, ratified new contracts.  And striking workers at a third CP Forest mill reached tentative agreement on a new pact.

59,"U.S. 3rd Qtr GNP Growth Rate Revised To 1.4% From 1.7%

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- The nation's Gross National Product expanded at a revised seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4% in the third quarter, after inflation is taken into account, the Commerce Department said. 

  The department's latest estimate of economic growth in the July-September period, its third and final estimate, was down from the 1.7% increase estimated last month. 

  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of 13 economists published Monday found an average expectation that GNP would grow at a 1.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate during the third quarter. 

  The GNP grew at real seasonally adjusted annual rates of 0.4% in the second quarter and 1.7% in the first quarter of 1990. 

  In comparing the current GNP estimate to last month's estimate, Commerce said that a downward revision of its consumer spending estimate essentially accounted for the drop. 

  The U.S. trade deficit widened, the department noted, but that was offset by increased federal government spending. 

  Commerce also said prices, as measured by the GNP-based implicit price deflator, rose at a revised 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter, compared with a 4.0% rise estimated last month. 

  Prices, as measured by the fixed-weight index, rose at a revised 4.2% rate in the third quarter, the same as in last month's report. 

  Commerce reiterated that due to its methodology, the sharp third-quarter increase in oil prices isn't apparent in the GNP price indexes. 

  Following the revision, Commerce estimates third quarter GNP, adjusted to 1982 dollars to account for inflation, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.170 trillion, compared with $4.173 estimated last month and $4.155 trillion in the second quarter. 

  Before inflation adjustment, Commerce estimates GNP at $5.515 trillion, compared with $5.521 trillion in last month's report and $5.443 trillion in the second quarter. 

  Real final sales, defined as GNP minus business inventories, was $4.165 trillion in the third quarter, compared with $4.168 trillion in last month's report and $4.146 trillion in the second quarter. 

  Third quarter GNP stood 0.4% ahead of second quarter GNP, while second quarter GNP gained 0.1% from the first quarter of 1990. 

  The after-tax profits of U.S.  corporations rose a revised 8.0% in the third quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $179.4 billion, compared to the 6.7% increase to $177.2 billion estimated last month. 

  Third quarter profits before taxes rose a revised 6.4% to a $318.5 billion rate, compared with a 5.4% increase to $315.4 billion estimated last month. 

  Profits from current production fell a revised 1.9% in the third quarter to a $300.7 billion rate, compared with the 3.8% fall to $294.9 billion estimated last month. 

  Net corporate cash flow decreased a revised 2.0% in the third quarter to a $392.0 billion rate, compared with a 3.2% drop to $387.2 billion in last month's report.

60,"OPEC Expected To Continue To Ignore Production Quotas

 

  RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -AP- Oil sources said that the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries is likely to reaffirm its policy of letting oil supplies gush while the Gulf crisis persists. 

  At the cartel's August meeting, called after Iraq invaded Kuwait, OPEC members agreed to ignore production ceilings and quotas to make up for the 4-million-barrel daily loss of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil, which is being kept off the world market by a U.N.-ordered boycott of Iraq and Kuwait. 

  Saudi Arabia alone has boosted production by about 60 pc, from 5.38 million barrels per day just before the Aug. 2 invasion to 8.3 million barrels per day. 

  Since the invasion, oil prices have fluctuated wildly between $25 and $40 per barrel, well above the OPEC benchmark price of $21 per barrel. 

  Sources here said today the agreement should hold at the cartel's meeting next week. 

  The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries meeting opens Wednesday in Vienna, but ministers are expected to start gathering on Monday for informal discussions. 

  Gulf sources said OPEC is currently producing about 23 million barrels per day, 500,000 barrels over the ceiling agreed to in July.

  Minnesota Mining is considered among the country's most recession-resistant companies. The company's stock fell more than $4 in reaction. 

  3M followed its disappointing earnings with a prediction of more of the same.  ""We look for a difficult business climate through the first half,"" said Allen F.  Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer. He cited economic softness and the war as factors. 

  As a result, analysts cut estimates for the year's profit by 10 cents to 20 cents and said 3M's domestic performance is an indication of things to come.  ""It is a harbinger of what other companies are going to be saying,"" said Eugene G. Glazer of Dean Witter, adding that 3M is ""more recession-resistant than most"" industrial giants. 

  The company didn't break out geographic results, but it said ""slightly lower selling prices for domestic operations led to a decline in U.S. operating profits. In addition, international profit gains were held back by increased price competition and investments"" in growth. 

  Sales rose 11%, to $3.28 billion from $2.95 billion, but only one of four major business sectors -- life sciences -- reported improved U.S.  earnings.  Other areas, including commercial and consumer and information technologies, suffered from eroding profit margins because of a 1% decline in U.S. selling prices and higher raw materials costs. Products particularly hard hit included videocassette tapes and computer diskettes. 

  The U.S. results, which one analyst termed ""pretty poor,"" plus the cautious outlook led to a sell-off in the stock, one of the 30 that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading 3M closed at $80.75, down $4.25, on volume of more than 2.6 million shares. 

  Some analysts predicted a further drop in the stock Thursday as they broadcast their marked-down earnings estimates for the year. Several analysts cut per-share estimates to the $6.20-$6.30 range from a consensus of $6.40. 

  ""The pricing, productivity and cost problems will continue in the first quarter,"" Smith Barney analyst Peter J. Enderlin advised clients yesterday. He reduced his per-share estimate for the quarter to $1.50, one cent less than last year's result. 

  B. Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache Securities was circumspect about the company's near-term prospects and said 3M finds itself in a conundrum. ""If the U.S.  economy picks up, the dollar is likely to rally . . .  which will wipe out the international growth story,"" he said.  ""It's a basic conflict that unfortunately will depress stock performance over the near term."" 

  Although about half of the company's $13 billion in sales last year occurred outside the U.S., softness in such domestic markets as automotive, housing and the general industrial areas combined to erode earnings. 

  One major factor in profit margin declines was raw materials inflation, reflecting higher prices for petrochemical items. A company spokesman said 3M plans price increases during the current quarter. 

  Despite the softening economy, the company's chief financial officer said that he would recommend to the board

  The dollar stumbled much of the fourth quarter and several times posted new post-war lows amid concerns about the state of the U.S. economy.  The weakness came despite saber-rattling by both the U.S. and Iraq that subsequently led to some of the highest oil prices in history, and later, war. 

  The dollar, which sank to a low of 1.4625 marks Dec. 10, ranged during the quarter between 1.4625 marks and 1.5645 marks and 123.70 yen to 137.88 yen. 

  Early in the fourth quarter there were concerns about whether a U.S.  budget accord would be forthcoming.  After a budget compromise was hammered out in late October, outright pessimisim about the state of the U.S.  economy also cut the dollar's value, as did market expectations of lower U.S. interest rates. 

  On Dec. 4 the Federal Reserve Board cut banks' reserve requirements on certain deposits, which was in effect a credit easing.  On Dec. 19, the Fed eased again with a 0.5-percentage-point cut in the discount rate to 6.5 pc. 

  During the quarter, the persistant standoff in the Persian Gulf forced crude oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange as high as $41.15 a barrel in October. The price had slipped to $28.70 a barrel by quarter's end. 

  The surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Dec. 20 added a fresh dimension to the Soviet Union's problems and helped damp the strength of the mark, which lost more than 3.5 pfennings against the dollar on that day.

  WASHINGTON -AP- The Soviet Union has bought a large quantity of U.S.  corn, a day after receiving the go-ahead on a $900 million credit deal, the Agriculture Department said. 

  Private exporters reported selling 3.72 million metric tons of corn and 550,000 tons of soybean meal for delivery to the Soviet Union in 1991, the first year of a new long-term grain agreement signed June 1. 

  Exporters are required by law to report large sales of grain to USDA on a daily basis.  However, no selling prices or other details are provided. 

  Although the announcement didn't say the grain and meal were covered by the new credit guarantee, terms of the deal clearly showed the commodities were eligible for the financing, according to one official who demanded anonymity. 

  Thus, it appeared that a large portion of the $900 million approved for USDA guarantees - the actual loans are handled by private banks - is being used quickly. 

  For example, corn last month was valued at more than $100 per metric ton delivered to export ports at the Gulf of Mexico.  The 3.72 million tons of corn could have an export value of around $380 million. 

  Last month, President Bush announced the Soviet Union would be offered up to $1 billion in credit guarantees to buy U.S.  commodities. In announcing the $900 million yesterday, the USDA said the remainder would be allocated later. 

  The credit package includes $530 million for feed grains, primarily corn; $165 million for wheat or flour; $130 million for protein meals, mostly soybean; and $25 million for poultry meat.  Also, $50 million was earmarked for transportation costs. 

  Under the five-year agreement reached in 1990, the Soviet Union is committed to buy a minimum of 10 million tons of U.S. grain each year.

  FRANKFURT -DJ- Helmut Hesse, president of the state central bank of Lower Saxony, said there isn't much room for an interest rate increase in Germany because of the trend toward lower interest rates in other nations. 

  Hesse, who is also a member of the Deutsche Bundesbank's policy-making Central Bank Council, made his comments in an annual New Year's speech to bankers in Hanover, where the state bank is based. 

  An increase in Bundesbank's offical lending rates could weaken the dollar again, which should be avoided, he said. He added that higher rates would strengthen the Deutsche mark and exacerbate pressures within the exchange rate stabilization arrangement of the European Monetary System. 

  Despite the lack of room for a rate increase, Hesse also acknowledged there are ""strong attractions"" for such a move, including attracting new capital to finance Eastern Germany.  Higher rates also would help damp strong demand in Germany that could feed inflation and offest the potential inflationary impact of growing wage and salary demands. 

  Hesse's comments contrast with those of other Bundesbank officials.  On Dec. 30, Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said higher interest rates might be needed if the mark suffered because of reliance on further state debt to finance German unification. 

  Many Bundesbank watchers expect an increase in the Bundesbank's discount rate in coming weeks, possibly as soon as a scheduled Jan. 17 meeting of the Central Bank Council. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing.

  BEIJING -AP- A strict austerity program begun two years ago will be extended for another year or more because it has failed to fully achieve intended results, China's government said today. 

  The basis for China's economic upturn is still rather fragile, an official told a news conference.  Some problems are yet to be resolved and others are still far from being resolved, he said. 

  China plans in 1991 to achieve a moderate 4.5 pc growth rate in the gross national product, 3.5 pc in agriculture and 6 pc in industry. 

  At a national economic planning meeting last month, Premier Li Peng told the meeting that the Communist Party suggested the austerity measures be extended into a third year or even longer. 

  Implemented in the fall of 1988 to bring down runaway inflation, the program succeeded in bringing inflation from a high of nearly 40 pc down to 3 pc for most of last year, but economists are warning of a resurgence. 

  Serious stockpiling, continued poor industrial growth and a large infusion of loans despite budget difficulties ""might result in potential inflationary pressure,"" the government said. 

  By the end of last November, China's stockpiles of unsold goods had increased by 30 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. No total figures were released. 

  Official reports have said new loans last year totaled 250 billion to 290 billion yuan, the highest ever in the 40 years of Communist rule.  The loans were made at a time when the budget deficit was estimated at about 10 billion yuan. 

  The massive injection of credit in the second half of 1990 helped boost last year's industrial growth rate to the planned 6 pc, the government said.  But an official report yesterday said some enterprises artificially sped up production to meet the target, merely adding to stockpiles.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said the Energy Department projects an inflation-adjusted 5 pc a year increase in oil prices over the next decade. 

  He said the forecast was based on the probability that world consumption will continue to rise and that oil production won't be able to keep up.  Moore's statement came in response to a question about what the department could do to stabilize oil prices to encourage drilling by independent producers. 

  Moore, testifying before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on the National Energy Strategy, said the administration's plan doesn't specifically address the price of oil but that research and development on oil discovery should spur more drilling by independent producers. 

  Energy Secretary James Watkins said that he foresees a new emerging relationship with Arab leaders that will help stabilize markets and market projections. He said he expects the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reassess ""what they do in the way of quotas,"" adding he doesn't expect their actions to result in a fall in oil prices. 

  Separately, Moore said proposed legislation by Rep. Phillip Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the subcommittee, to set aside a certain amount of oil imports to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve might not be helpful. Moore said the department is currently reviewing the legislation, but that ""our gut feeling right off the bat"" is that such legislation might be more regressive than helpful.

  BLUE BELL, Pa. -DJ- Unisys Corp.  said its board has voted to suspend dividends on its Series A, Series B and Series C cumulative preferred shares ""to provide additional funds for our debt reduction effort."" 

  The company also said its debt reduction efforts include the sale of non-core assets from a list valued at more than $1 billion. 

  ""We and our advisers have initiated discussions with potential purchasers,"" the company said in a press release. 

  Unisys said it had reduced debt, net of cash, by $600 million in 1990 and has set a goal of a minimum of another $600 million reduction in 1991 through internally generated funds and the sale of non-core assets. 

  A ""large portion"" of this reduction may come from asset sales, the company said.  Unisys added that it did not know what portion of the non-core asset list will actually be sold this year. 

  The company last paid a 93.75-cent dividend on the series A preferred Jan.  15.  The series B and C shares are all held by Japan's Mitsui & Co.  Altogether the dividends suspended represent an annual payout of about $120 million, Unisys said. 

  ""While we made significant progress in reducing debt during 1990, in this weakened and uncertain economic climate suspension of the dividends is a prudent step to provide additional funds for our debt reduction effort.  Debt reduction is central to the progress now being made in implementing strategic product programs and related customer service initiatives,"" the company said. 

  -0- 

  The decision underscores the depth of the trouble in which Unisys finds itself because of its overly aggressive expansion campaign in the late 1980s.  That can be especially dangerous in the computer industry, where customers depend so much on their suppliers that they get nervous at the first signs of financial troubles. 

  Unisys common stock, which has nearly doubled since Feb. 1 on rumors of possible asset sales, rose a further 50 cents to $4.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange -- but the move left some securities analysts puzzled. 

  ""You have to wonder what the traders have seen in the past few days that those of us who have been following this for a while haven't seen,"" said Dan Mandresh, a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. ""You can argue about whether the right price is 2 1/2 or 4 1/2, but nothing has changed"" in the past few days to account for the stock price's jump. 

  Unisys is within about $200 million of violating a net-worth covenant in a major bank loan, but its banks have so far been supportive. Unisys also reiterated yesterday that it has begun talking with companies that might buy some of its assets and that it has put more than $1 billion of assets up for sale. 

  Unisys cut its debt by $200 million last year, while also increasing its cash by $400 million, and has said it hopes to cut debt by at least $600 million this year. 

  Unisys hasn't identified what assets it might sell, but the speculation has centered on its $2.5 billion-a-year defense business, its one-third share of a large marketing company in Japan or its Timeplex network business. The company also has plant capacity to sell, because of consolidation among its facilities as it has laid off workers. 

  Unisys has been talking about selling assets for several quarters now, however, and the deteriorating economy has clearly made it more difficult for Unisys to get the sort of prices it wants.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- President Bush, continuing a stream of unrelenting administration pressure on the U.S.  central bank in recent weeks, called for the Federal Reserve to ""sustain money and credit growth"" as a means of combating the sluggish economy. 

  Lower interest rates alone may not signal easier money in an environment of weak loan demand, his Council of Economic Advisers said, arguing in favor of a stronger expansion of the money supply. 

  The president also repeated assertions that a cut in the capital gains tax and various other revenue concessions are needed as ""pro-growth initiatives"" to help assure a rebound in the economy later this year.  Depicted lately as wavering on the tax issue, Bush declared himself to be ""firmly committed"" to lowering the cost of capital. 

  Writing in his annual economic report to Congress, the president argued that the Fed's credibility as an inflation-fighter is sufficiently high that the central bank can now pursue policies adequate to ""significantly"" mitigate the current economic downturn without engendering fears of a fresh price spiral. 

  The underlying rate of U.S.  inflation was showing ""clear signs"" of falling at the end of 1990 and price pressures are expected to ease further this year, Bush said. 

  Elsewhere in the report, the president's Council of Economic Advisers maintained that lower interest rates alone aren't necessarily indicative of easier money, but rather may reflect declining demand for credit.  The three administration economists, led by Michael Boskin, called for money supply growth ""well within"" the target ranges to be set shortly by the central bank for 1991. 

  Easier money policies in the U.S., combined with a recent rise in West German interest rates and firm rates in Japan, have served to put considerable downward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets, but the administration is apparently prepared to live with that situation in the interest of getting the U.S. economy moving again. 

  Bush didn't mention the U.S.  currency in his personal introduction to the annual economic report and his advisers, who wrote the bulk of the lengthy document, only touched on the dollar.  Achieving strong non-inflationary domestic economic growth requires, among other things, ""a sustainable trade balance and relatively stable exchange rates,"" the White House economists said. 

  The G-7 group of major industrial nations, where foreign exchange rate policy has at times been coordinated, was mentioned only briefly - as ""a framework within which economic issues of mutual concern can be discussed.""

  J.M. Peters has, since August, put much of its much of its land and its inventory of unsold houses on the block. ""We're trying to shrink the company at this point as fast as we can,"" vice president and chief financial officer Petersen told Dow Jones. 

  ""Cash reserves are now at a critical level,"" J.M. Peters said in its SEC filing. It added that ""certain payments may need to be deferred to maintain what cash reserves are available."" 

  Cash and short-term investments totaled $15 million at Nov. 30, off from $63.8 million at Feb. 28, 1990.  Losses in the nine months ended Nov. 30 totaled $6 million, or 43 cents a share, compared to net income of $14.2 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 14 pc, to $161.9 million from $188.2 million a year earlier. 

  Petersen said that housing interest has picked up since the end of November, when the statements for the latest-reported fiscal period were closed. ""Sales are continuing to be rather strong,"" he said. ""Low interest rates and buyers' perception that the inventory of available homes is dwindling"" have sparked demand, he added.

  NEW YORK -DJ- The U.S.  likely will have to accept slower progress against inflation, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Robert Forrestal. 

  Forrestal, speaking to the Jacksonville branch of the Atlanta Fed, said that the U.S.  ""may need to tolerate slower progress against inflation than we had earlier hoped for"" because of the need to reduce the federal deficit. 

  ""As a nation, we must devote a growing portion of any expansion we might experience to servicing our debt,"" but without adding to inflation, Forrestal said. 

  Forrestal said he sees growth in real gross national product averaging 0.5 pc for fiscal 1991. He also expected to see improvement in GNP in the second half of the year, adding that he believes ""the recession will be over by the end of 1991."" 

  GNP declined at a 2.0 pc annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1990. 

  Forrestal said, ""there is little likelihood in the near term that we will return to the kind of performance we enjoyed in the mid-1980s."" 

  Forrestal also said he sees the unemployment rate at 6.5 pc by year's end. The jobless rate was at 6.1 pc in January, the last month for which data is available. 

  But the Atlanta Fed president added that inflation will drop back to an annualized 4 pc rate by the end of the year.

73,"4th Qtr GNP Seen Left Unchanged At -2% Rate

 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Fourth quarter gross national product is expected to remain unchanged at a 2 pc annual rate of contraction when the Commerce Departement releases its second GNP revision, according to the average estimate of 13 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

  Commerce's two inflation measures in the report, the GNP implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight index, are both seen being left unchanged at 2.8 pc and 4.7 pc, respectively. 

  Fourth quarter GNP previously was revised to a negative 2 pc annual rate from the original estimate of negative 2.1 pc. When Commerce made its previous revision, the implicit deflator was left unchanged at 2.8 pc while the fixed-weight index was revised to 4.7 pc from 4.1 pc. 

  Estimates for revised fourth quarter GNP range from a call for 1.6 pc rate of contraction to one call for a 2.2 pc decline. Almost all of the economists surveyed look for the two inflation gauges to be unrevised. 

  Commerce will release its report on second and final GNP revisions Wednesday at 8:30 a.m.  EST. 

  One of the major factors that caused the first revision to fourth quarter GNP, and which is seen as the most likely candidate to create further revisions, is the change in the pace of inventory liquidation in the three-month period. 

  Non-farm inventories in the fourth quarter were revised to show a decline at a $24 billion rate, compared with the original estimate of a $19.8 billion contraction pace. 

  While inventory liquidation is a drag on GNP, it often portends a pickup in growth in future periods. 

  Final sales, which are total GNP minus inventories, and which accounts for about two-thirds of GNP, is expected to have been left unchanged at a tepid 0.7 pc rate.

74,"USDA Says March Farm Prices Rose 2.1% From February

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- The Agriculture Department said farm prices in March rose 2.1% from February as beef cattle prices soared to record highs. 

  Cattle prices averaged a record $78 a hundredweight, up $1 from February, the Department said.  The previous record was $77, set last month. 

  Steer and heifer prices averaged $81.70 per hundredweight in March, while cows averaged $53.80. 

  Calf prices averaged $106 per hundredweight, eclipsing the old record set last month by $2. 

  The Agriculture Department said fruit prices rose 10% in March, led by price rises for oranges, lemons and grapefruit. Orange prices averaged $7.41 a box, up $1.43 from February. 

  ""Higher citrus prices reflected shorter supplies caused by the December freeze in California and also higher-quality Valencia oranges moving to market,"" the department said in its monthly report. 

  Cotton prices hit their highest level since January 1981, averaging 73 cents a pound in March, an increase of 5.1 cents. 

  Slight rises were also registered by corn, oats, and sorghum as well as rice and wheat. 

  Egg prices jumped 14.8 cents a dozen to 74.9 cents in March as a result of strong seasonal demand, the department said. 

  Milk prices fell to their lowest levels since July, 1988. Milk sold to dealers and processing plants averaged $11.50 a hundredweight, down 20 cents from February and down $2.40 from March 1990. 

  -0- 

  It was the sharpest month-to-month increase in farm prices since July 1988, reflecting very strong demand for cotton and freeze damage to the California citrus crop, among other things. 

  Consumers can expect no respite from high beef prices as meatpackers pass on the costs of buying cattle in one of the tightest markets in memory. 

  ""We're at a 10-year low in beef production and close to a 30-year low in total cattle numbers,"" said Tommy Beall, a livestock market analyst for Cattle-Fax Inc., Englewood, Colo.

75,"Arctic Alaska Fisheries Interview -2-

 

  Arctic Alaska Fisheries hasn't seen a decline in regular seasonal demand for its products despite the recession, president and chief executive Jensen told Dow Jones. 

  He said U.S. and foreign demand continues to increase at a 6 pc rate per year, although he said that rate could go as high as 10 pc a year in the next 18 months as consumers become more conscious about cutting fat from their diets. 

  Increased demand is coming at the same time as a shortage of white fish, due partly to demand and and partly to government regulation.  Restaurant chains, such as Red Lobster and Shoney's, that are big customers for the company's products are concerned about the continuity of supply, Jensen said. 

  This is increasing prices for Arctic Alaska, which has about 13 pc of the 4.2 billion pound North Pacific bottom fishing harvest, up from about 10 pc last year. 

  Pollock fillets a year ago were selling for 90 cents a pound wholesale, compared with $1.50 to $1.60 now, Jensen 

said.   ""Up to six months ago, it was a buyer's market,"" he said. 

  Jensen said while demand for fish is up, the industry still has to deal with a resource that is highly regulated by the federal government, which can cause the supply to fluctuate for various species. 

  For example, this year for the first time, the pollock season was divided into two segments, one in the first quarter and the other beginning June 1 until the quota is reached. 

  Cod may also face some defacto regulation this year because other species with a lower government quota often get caught in nets at the same time. 

  ""So the by-catch issue is very important to this industry,"" Jensen said.  ""It can affect a major amount of tonnage of other fish."" 

  Jensen said the company is coping with the lull in pollock fishing by sending four vessels to the Washington and Oregon coasts in the next two weeks to begin processing whiting into fillets and hake into surimi, a protein base manufactured from bottomfish and used to make such seafood products as imitation crab, shrimp, scallops and lobster tails. 

  The company is also researching the commercial marketing possibilities of other species of fish that aren't in short supply, such as the flounder and the turbot.

  FRANKFURT -DJ- Following sharp warnings from Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today, another member of the German central bank's directorate, Otmar Issing, said there isn't any room to consider easier monetary policy in Germany at this time. 

  In remarks prepared for address to a bankers gathering outside Frankfurt, Issing remarked that given the ongoing buoyant increases in annual wage increases, ""There is no room to allow for a self-reinforcing process of cost and price surges.  There is no consideration of a loosening of the reins of monetary policy,"" he said. 

  But Issing didn't specifically say German interest rates should be increased either.  In fact many economists don't expect the Bundesbank to boost its rates at this time despite intensifying warnings from monetary officials about potential inflationary pressures in Germany. 

  The official cited continuing labor negotiations in Germany, under which some contracts for 1991 already have been concluded at relatively high increases. Some major unions had agreed on wage boosts this year of 7 pc, or more, compared with an inflation rate that is expected to run between 3 pc and 4 pc. 

  Government and monetary officials have expressed concern over the extent of the wage increases this year, which are nearly double what is considered by some policy makers. 

  Issing asserted that the Bundesbank will continue to follow a monetary policy aimed at keeping the country's M-3 money supply growth in 1991 within a target range of an annualized growth of between 4 pc to 6 pc.

77,"Fed Cuts Discount Rate One-Half Point To 5.5%

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- The Federal Reserve Board cut its official discount rate to 5.5% from 6%, effective immediately. 

  The Fed said the action was taken in light of continued weakness in the economy, especially in the industrial and capital goods areas, ""and evidence of abating inflationary pressures."" 

  The central bank also said the reduction ""in part"" realigns the discount rate with market interest rates. 

  The Fed Board of Governors approved the reduction following requests from the Boston, New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas regional reserve banks. 

  The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges depository institutions when they borrow from their district reserve banks. 

  The vote in favor of the fresh 1/2-point cut in the discount rate was 4-1. 

  Fed Governor Wayne Angell dissented. There was no immediate explanation for his negative vote. 

  -0- 

  In conjunction with the move, the Fed also lowered its target for the important federal funds interest rate to 5.75% from 6%. Other interest rates are expected to fall in turn. 

  The Fed's action comes as the Bush administration has begun considering whether to reappoint Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires in August. Some administration officials -- including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu -- have been critical of Greenspan because of the Fed's reluctance to cut rates. But administration officials said Bush's praise yesterday is a sign that he is likely to reappoint Greenspan. 

  Officials familiar with the Fed's deliberations say the board has been debating the rate-cutting move for several weeks. Greenspan and Fed Governor David Mullins are said to have become increasingly concerned about signs of continued weakness among manufacturers. But Governors Angell, John LaWare and Edward Kelley were all reluctant to move. 

  LaWare and Kelley finally agreed to the rate cut Tuesday. 

  Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in an interview Tuesday that he still believes ""there is ample room for lower interest rates."" 

  Tuesday's action was unusual: The Fed wanted to engineer a small cut in the federal funds rate, but was forced to cut the discount rate first in order to prevent the federal funds rate from dropping below it. The Fed usually keeps the funds rate higher than the discount rate, and Fed officials feared any change in that practice would confuse people in the financial markets. 

  The discount rate is set solely by the Fed governors in Washington. But the more important funds rate is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, which includes the governors plus five of the 12 regional Fed presidents from outside of Washington. 

  In recent months, Greenspan has been under criticism from several regional presidents, who argue that he exceeded his authority earlier this year to alter the funds rate target between meetings of the committee. The Fed chairman skirted that issue yesterday by cutting the funds rate only a quarter percentage point; the directive adopted by the committee at its last meeting on March 26 gave him the authority to cut the rate that much, but no more. 

  Angell reportedly voted against the move because he was afraid Fed easing might increase worries about inflation and cause bond traders to drive up interest rates on long-term bonds. He believes the best way to ensure an economic recovery is to bring down long-term interest rates, which affect the housing market, rather than reducing short-term rates. 

  But the bond markets, at least yesterday, were encouraged by the Fed's move, and long-term rates declined.

  Texaco Inc. said first-quarter earnings reflected improved refined product margins in international downstream operations. 

  Revenues reflected higher average worldwide crude oil and refined product prices and higher crude sales volumes, the company said. 

  Margins in Europe were higher as a result of operational improvements, completed capital programs and improved prices due to tight supplies and colder weather, Texaco said in a press release. 

  Margins in the Far East improved, primarily in Japan, which allowed the flow through of 1990 crude costs.  In the United States, margins were slightly better than last year's very depressed levels, Texaco said. 

  Upstream earnings were below the first quarter of last year, the company said.  Lower production in the U.K. due to scheduled maintenance coupled with declining U.S. heavy crude oil prices and decreased natural gas prices and volumes during the mild winter in the U.S.  contributed to the fall in upstream earnings, Texaco said.

79,"Bank Of Canada Outlines Anti-Inflation Goals

 

  OTTAWA -DJ- The Bank of Canada reaffirmed its commitment to its new inflation reduction targets and said it is now taking measures to assure that the goals will be met. 

  Action has to be taken now because of the ""long and variable lags"" in monetary policy, Charles Freedman, the central bank's deputy governor, told the Canadian Association for Business Economics today. 

  The anti-inflation targets call for the rise in the consumer price index to slow to 3 pc by the end of 1992, 2.5 pc by mid-1994 and 2 pc by the end of 1995.  Thereafter the objective would be further reductions in inflation until price stability is achieved.  In 1990 the consumer price index showed an average rise of 4.8 pc. 

  ""We will be keeping a close eye on nominal spending, credit aggregates and monetary aggregates,"" Freedman said. He said the monetary aggregates are expected to grow ""relatively quickly over the coming year"" because of a decline of more than 400 basis points in short-term interest rates in the past year. 

  M1 is expected to show particularly rapid growth because it is ""very interest sensitive,"" he said.  M1 includes demand deposits and the public's holdings of currency. 

  Freedman said the Bank of Canada can be held accountable for the inflation reduction targets and doesn't intend to fudge them. ""If in two or three years you come back and say you blew it we are accountable for that.  We have said we are going to achieve this."" 

  The executive said the central bank was committed to stable  prices because of the benefits it would bring to Canadian business and individuals.  In the past decade, he said inflation has distorted investment decisions and financial markets, eroded savings, and burdened consumers and businesses with new costs.  The 25-year mortgage has disappeared and the long-term corporate bond market has weakened, he said. 

  Freedman said that if some event, such as a major hike in indirect taxes, were to push the consumer price index higher than next year's price target of 3 pc, there would be no upward adjustments of the 1994 and 1995 targets.  ""It will make the task tougher, but the key point is we are going to bring it down,"" he  said.

   By Carl Johnston 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- The U.S.  continues to charge South Korea with unfair trading practices, but is enjoying the best trade performance with the East Asian nation since the early 1980s. 

  Although Korean trade barriers remain high, and some reports show that frictions have actually increased, South Korea's bilateral trade surplus with the U.S. has been progressively whittled away since its peak in 1988. 

  The reasons are numerous and have more to do with the nations' domestic economy than international factors.  The factors include: the appreciation of the Korean currency, the won; domestic inflation; labor disputes; rising labor costs and a relative slowing of economic growth, according to Renato Amador, South Korea Desk Officer at the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration. 

  ""There's really not one factor, there's a whole range of reasons,"" for the narrowing of South Korea's trade surplus, says Amador. 

  Amador notes that South Korea is in an ""evolutionary"" phase of its economic development as it begins to increase domestic consumption and labor wages rise.  In the meantime, Gross National Product (GNP) growth has slowed from its blistering double-digit pace in 1986-1988 to a more ""moderate"" 9 pc expansion rate in 1990. 

  The Commerce Department said that the U.S. had a $39.6 million trade deficit with South Korea in January 1991, continuing a trend of sharp improvement in the U.S. bilateral trade performance.  The U.S. hasn't had a monthly surplus with South Korea since a $1.5 million surplus in April 1983. 

  For all of 1990, the U.S.  had a deficit of $4.1 billion, down substantially from $6.3 billion in 1989 and a peak of $8.9 billion in 1988. 

  Measured in other ways, the U.S.  trade performance has improved even more. The Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry estimates that the U.S.  actually registered a $143 million surplus in January.  The ministry also says that its overall trade deficit widened to $1.6 billion in February, from $573 million in February 1990.

   By John Urquhart 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  OTTAWA - The Bank of Canada is believed to be on track to meet its 1991 guidepost for inflation reduction, official sources said. 

  The guidepost requires that the rise in the consumer price index by the end of this year be held to less than 4 pc from a year earlier after adjustment for indirect taxes, including a 7 pc goods and service tax introduced Jan.  1. 

  The Bank of Canada set only a provisional inflation benchmark for this year because of the price impact of the new value-added tax.  The government has estimated that the new levy will push up consumer prices by an additional 1 1/4 pc this year. 

  The sources said that after eliminating the estimated impact of the new GST tax and other new indirect taxes, they were reasonably confident that the 1991 inflation guidepost would be reached.  The central bank is expected to announce later this year its estimates of the 1991 price impact of the various new indirect taxes imposed by the federal and provincial governments. 

  The Bank of Canada's formal inflation reduction targets, announced with the Finance Department in late February, call for the rise in the consumer price index to be held to 3 pc by the end of 1992, 2.5 pc by mid-1994 and 2 pc by the end of 1995.  Thereafter, the objective would be further reductions in inflation until price stability is achieved. 

  The sources said the Bank of Canada remains concerned about the potential inflationary impact of Canadian wage settlements.  Major wage contracts negotiated in the first quarter provided an average annual base rate increase of 6.2 pc, up from 5.9 pc in the 1990 fourth quarter. 

  The sources predicted that the level of wage settlements would drop before long.  In the 1981-82 recession, wage settlements showed a sharp decline after four quarters of economic decline, they noted.  The current recession is now in its fifth quarter.

  O'FALLON, Mo. -DJ- Venture Stores Inc. reported sales for the four weeks ended May 4 of $102 million, an increase of 4.9 pc from April 1990 sales of $97.2 million. 

  Comparable store sales increased 1.1 pc for the same period. Comparable stores are thos eopen at least one year. 

  For the first quarter of 1991 (13 weeks ended May 4, 1991) sales were $314.8 million, compared with $289.2 million a year ago, an 8.8 pc increase.  Comparable store sales increased 4.5 pc for the quarter. 

  Julian Seeherman, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a press release, ""April sales, while on plan, were weaker than the prior month's performance.  The shift of Easter from April in 1990 to March in 1991 resulted in a shift of sales between these months when compared to last year. Sales in the beginning of April were robust, slowing near the end of the month due to dramatic weather shifts from the prior year, and, in our opinion, a more difficult economic climate. 

  ""The slowdown in sales paralleled the increase in gasoline prices, and we believe this had an impact on spending by our customers.  We are optimistic about sales opportunities in the second quarter, but continue to plan conservatively.""

84,"Kemp Reported Concerned Over Administration Pressure On Fed

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, well known for his willingness to publicly criticize the Federal Reserve for high interest rates and an alleged lack of concern about economic growth, is now reported to be in the opposite camp. 

  According to Washington Post columnist Hobart Rowan, Kemp is currently experiencing discomfort over the degree of pressure the Bush administration, in which he serves, is putting on the U.S.  central bank to ease money. 

  ""Kemp explained to me,"" Rowan said in a column published today, ""that if policy is limited solely to achieving lower short-term interest rates, it will weaken the long-term bond market, threatening the housing industry, and raising the specter of inflation."" 

  ""You can't inflate your way to economic growth,"" Kemp is quoted as saying. 

  In fairness, the ""supply side"" economic theories to which Kemp unabashedly subscribes, generally envisage steady growth of the money supply.  With a ""sound"" monetary policy in place, economic growth can properly be stimulated by lower taxes, Kemp and other supply siders maintain. 

  But in practice, Kemp has generally found the Fed off course in the direction of excessive restraint, allegedly as a result of ""excessive"" concerns about inflation among central bank policymakers. 

  Indeed, the Fed chairman with whom Kemp most frequently sparred was Paul Volcker, who consistently argued exactly what the HUD secretary reportedly now sees at issue: lowering short-term rates too far could be counterproductive if the long end of the market reacts badly to such moves. 

  Do the HUD secretary's currently views presage a shift in the administration's posture? 

  According to Rowan, Kemp admits to ""marginal"" influence within the administration on such matters. 

  ""If I were the Secretary of the Treasury, what I said would be really important,"" Kemp is quoted as saying.  ""But I'm not,"" he concedes with his usual splash of candor.

85,"Bank Of Canada - Inflation -2-

 

  Bank of Canada Governor Crow told the March 22 meeting that Canada's economy was ""weak."" He cited national accounts data, which showed a 1-pc decline in gross domestic product in the 1990 fourth quarter from the previous quarter. 

  Regarding money and credit aggregates, he said their growth ""remained at a moderate pace."" 

  The governor indicated that, since the last board meeting Feb. 15, a further easing in monetary conditions had occurred in response to the decline in inflationary pressures. 

  He said the central bank's monetary policy operations in the period since mid-February were initially oriented toward resisting strong speculative pressures that might lead to ""excessive"" declines in short-term interest rates.  But as market sentiment shifted away from the anticipation of large additional declines in interest rates, the central moved to ""a more neutral posture,"" he said. 

  The report said that, during the Feb. 15-March 22 period, money-market dealers drew heavily on their ordinary purchase and resale agreement (PRA) lines.  On 10 occasions, the central bank extended special PRA to temper upward pressure on the call loan rate. 

  To assist at times in countering excessive downward pressure on interest rates in the three-month area, there were ""a number'of sales of treasury bills.  In addition, there was one offering of sale and repurchase agreements in February to counter unwarranted easing in the overnight money market. 

  The central bank made a total of 50 advances to members of the Canadian Payments Association over the 25 business days since the Feb. 15 board meeting, including 18 to major banks.

86,"May CPI And Core Inflation Rate Both Seen Up 0.3%

 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Apparel and gasoline price gains are among factors seen boosting the Consumer Price Index by 0.3 pc in May, according to the average of forecasts of 16 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

  The core rate of inflation - CPI less the food and energy components - is expected to also have risen by 0.3 pc in May, according to 14 of the economists surveyed. 

  The projected CPI advances would be ""the biggest gains in the last couple of months,"" notes Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 

  May's consumer price data will be reported Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. 

  In recent months, CPI rose 0.2 pc in April, declined by 0.1 pc in March and advanced 0.2 pc in February. 

  The core rate, meanwhile, increased by 0.2 pc in April, rose 0.1 pc in March and spiked up by 0.7 pc in February. 

  Flanagan, who forecasts a 0.4 pc rise in CPI and a 0.3 pc core inflation rate increase for May, expects that ""gasoline 

provided a supporting influence.   Food pressures, apparel, medical care and mass transit fees"" also likely boosted the consumer price measures last month, he says. 

  Overall CPI forecasts from 16 economists surveyed ranged from three calls for a 0.2 pc rise to four estimates for a 0.4 pc increase. Of the 14 predictions for the core rate, CPI less food and energy, there were eight estimates for a 0.3 pc upturn and six calls for a 0.2 pc advance. 

  Analysts at Mitsubishi Bank write that ""there is a potential for a large 0.8 pc increase in May apparel prices, which could edge up the core rate modestly to 0.3 pc."" 

  They add that some of the expected apparel price rise would be offset by a relatively ""small increase in food prices following April's hefty 0.7 pc increase."" 

  The April food price gains were ""heavily concentrated in the volatile fresh fruits and dried vegetables category,"" the analysts write. ""Fresh vegetable prices rose 15.4 pc in April due to adverse weather impacts in California and 'insect infestations' that resulted in some shortages.""

  TOKYO -DJ- All Nippon Airways Co.  said consolidated pretax profit dropped 16 pc in the fiscal year ended March 31 to 27.12 billion yen from 32.11 billion yen a year ago, largely due to sharply higher fuel costs resulting from the Persian Gulf war. 

  Net profit in the latest year was 11.51 billion yen, down 24 pc from 15.16 billion yen a year ago.  Earnings were 8.37 yen a share, compared with 11.03 yen the year before. 

  Sales rose 11 pc to 803.37 billion yen from 722.61 billion yen. 

  Pretax profit also registered a decline due to the 68 pc leap in pretax profit made in the previous year on the back of sales of both securities holdings and four jetliners. Only two jetliners - and no securities - were sold in the latest year. 

  The Gulf war contributed to higher fuel prices, but because All Nippon Airways' emphasis is on domestic air travel, the fear of terrorism, which hurt international air traffic didn't have much of an effect on All Nippon Airways, the company said. 

  The company also said it expects consolidated pretax profit to recover to 29 billion yen in the current fiscal year, with net income edging up to 11.6 billion yen and sales reaching 875 billion yen.

88,"Housing Starts Rise In Line With Sales Gains

 
   By Andrew Sobel 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Housing starts advanced slightly in May, more evidence that the sector has partially recovered from its steep 1990 slide. 

  The modest 0.1% May rise to a seasonally adjusted 982,000 unit annual rate was expected because it follows three months of rising new home sales, says Michael Moran, chief economist, Daiwa Securities America Inc., in New York. 

  Sales of new homes encourage builders to replenish their inventories to meet demand. 

  The May starts pace was slightly lower than the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus, which called for a 995,000-unit rate. 

  Michael Niemira, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank, Ltd., in New York, agrees with Moran that increased new home sales are spurring starts. 

  The key for builders is that new homes are becoming increasingly attractive to potential buyers when compared to existing homes, Niemira says. 

  ""A narrowing of the price gap between new and existing home prices makes the new-home price premium relatively less onerous than it was even six months ago,"" Niemira says. 

  Over the year ending April 1991, that gap has narrowed to $21,800 from $34,300. In April, the median new home price was $122,000, while the median price of an existing single-family home was $100,200. 

  A rebound in home construction won't be held back by a lack of workers. The industry has lost about one-tenth of its jobs over the past year. 

  Many of those residential construction workers may return to work soon, as builder inventories have declined to 7.4 months at the current sales pace from a high of 9.3 months in January. 

  The Commerce Department revised April housing starts upward to show an increase of 8.2% to a 981,000 starts rate. The April gain was originally estimated at 6.2% and the level at 957,000. 

  The April-May gains in housing starts constitute the first back-to-back monthly increase in starts since June-July 1989, Commerce said. 

  Building permits data included in the starts report provide more evidence that residential construction rebounded in May. 

  May permits rose 7.2 pc to a seasonally adjusted 979,000 annual rate, after a 2.4 pc gain in April to a 913,000 annual rate. 

  The April permits data are unchanged from that released by the Commerce Department late last month.  The department revises permits data about six days after the starts release. 

  About 75 pc of permits in a given month are issued for single-family homes and are thought to be contemperaneous with starts. That means the strong rise in May single-family permits might not translate into a sizable rise in June starts. 

  Multi-family permits, however, do have a long lead time before translating into construction, and there the data signal a busy summer. 

  Permits for structures with five units or more, surely the most beleaguered housing sector the past few years, rose nearly 50 pc in May. 

  The multi-family sector could use a boost, as May starts sunk to their lowest level - 118,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate - since Commerce began measuring the statistics in 1963. 

  The despairing May level of multi-family starts is a level ""no econometric model would have predicted,"" says Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. 

  ""The permit rise is a hopeful sign that maybe, just maybe, this time we've hit bottom.""

89,"Faster Non-Inflationary Growth Possible, Seger Says

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Former Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger said it's possible for the economy to grow faster without necessarily sparking a resurgence of inflation. 

  In remarks to the Global Economic Action Committee, Seger noted that financial market participants have become ""skittish"" about the prospects of an economic recovery because they fear a return to high rates of inflation. 

  ""As soon as you mention the word growth, people start throwing bonds out the window because of the inflation concern,"" Seger said. ""But that's not the case."" 

  Seger also took note of the 25 pc rise in the dollar against the deustche mark over the past several marks and said it has contributed to a slowdown in export growth in a number of areas.  To a lesser extent, she said, the same thing is happening against the yen. She said it is a major concern and added the Fed has something to do with how the dollar performs. 

  Seger said U.S. businesses have become so competitive that they can't necessarily raise prices or sustain price increases for any length of time.  She also pointed out that growing demand could increase operating efficiency of U.S. plants helping keep costs down and reducing further pressure on prices. 

  Therefore, ""even if growth is up, it won't necessarily start inflation,"" Seger said. 

  Seger was also critical of the Federal Reserve's tendency to overreact to inflation worries, saying the Fed should stop equating growth with inflation. 

  Seger said she didn't know whether the Fed will continue to ease monetary policy, but noted that she has always been a supporter of an easier monetary stance.

90,"Recession More Severe Than Govt Data Indicate, Firm Says

 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Current government measures have underestimated the severity of the recession and the rate of inflation last year and so far this year, according to the economic forecasting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. 

  ""I can guarantee that the Commerce Department will announce that the 1990-91 decline in real Gross National Product was deeper and that inflation was worse,"" said DRI chief economist Roger Brinner in a press release made available here. 

  ""The Department of Commerce now uses 1982 as the base year for splitting business revenues between growth in physical output and changes in prices. In November, they will re-base to 1987 values,"" he said. 

  Based on the current convention, DRI/McGraw-Hill noted that the government projects a cumulative annual decline in output during the recession of 1.0%, compared with a postwar recession average of 2.6 pc. Re-based to 1987, the current recession will appear somewhat deeper, according to Brinner, with a peak-to-trough decline of 1.3%. But even this understates the downturn, he said. 

  Using 1990 as the base year for calculating real GNP yields more accurate results, Brinner said.  ""Measured in 1990 dollars, real growth in the fourth quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991 declined at annualized rates of 5.3% and 1.7%, respectively. This implies a recession characterized by a decline of almost 2.0% in output, nearly double the 1.0% currently reported in 1982 dollars."" 

  The inflation picture is also worse than government estimates suggest, Brinner said: ""In 1990, the price index for all goods and services rose 4.9%, rather than 4.1%, if the benchmark year for evaluating output is shifted to 1990 from 1982. Similarly, the outlook for inflation this year - using the 1990 benchmark - is currently 4.0 pc, not 3.6%. Such differences are significant, given the Federal Reserve's ambition to cut inflation to 2% to 3% per year."" 

  Brinner traces the discrepancy between the 1982, 1987, and 1990 base-year values for GNP and inflation to the disproportionate weight given to the computer and related office products sector in the 1982 base-year calculations.

  LONDON -DJ- Mirror Group Newspapers PLC said its pretax profit rose 1.4 pc on a pro forma basis in the six months ended June 30, as price increases helped its tabloid publications to weather Britain's recession. 

  All results were given on a pro forma basis to adjust for the group's flotation in May. 

  Pretax profit in the latest six-month period was $42.0 million pounds ($70.7 million), up from $41.4 million in the comparable period a year earlier. 

  Sales rose 5.4 pc to 231.2 million pounds from 219.4 million. Earnings were 6.7 pence a share, up from 6.1 pence a year earlier. 

  The company said it will pay an interim dividend, covering the period from flotation, of 0.8 pence a share. 

  Mirror Group was floated on the London stock exchange after publisher Robert Maxwell sold a 49 pc stake through a public offering. 

  Mirror Group reported an extraordinary gain of 50.1 million pounds in the latest period, representing a gain on the sale of some titles and publishing businesses.  Details weren't given. 

  Mirror Group said it will increase cover prices during the second half, starting with the Saturday edition of the Daily Mirror tabloid newspaper.

   By Craig S. Smith 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Computer-guided buy programs prodded the market higher late in today's session after stocks took a midday nap. 

  Share prices started the day higher as investors bought stocks after a key inflation report sent yields falling in the bond market. 

  The Producer Price Index for June fell 0.3%, while excluding the volatile food and energy sectors the index was unchanged for the month. Many economists had expected the index to rise, reflecting growing inflationary pressures as the economy lifts from the recession. 

  But stocks soon settled down as a number of weak earnings reports sapped investor enthusiasm.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which hit resistance at about the 2,975 issue in its morning, scraped along the 2,950 level through the middle of the day. 

  Trading activity had begun to wane when the program buy programs snapped stock prices out of their slumber, sending the Dow Jones average to its highs for the day.  The industrials ended off those highs with a 21.02 point gain at 2,980.77. 

  Newton Zinder, technical analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the market may be headed to restest its old highs in the week ahead. 

  ""The market was helped by the fact that it didn't collapse during the mid-session selloff,"" said Zinder.  He also noted that the number of advancing stocks held above the number of declining stocks throughout the day. 

  ""The market's breadth has held up very well this week, even when the Dow (Jones average) was down,"" said Zinder. 

  At the close today, 1,017 stocks had advanced in price, while 496 had fallen.  NYSE volume totalled 173.6 million shares, up from 157.7 million shares. 

  Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 3.28 to 380.25, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 1.62 to 208.16, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 2.92 to 354.81. 

  While the market may well rise back to the top of its recent trading range at 3,035, there are high hurdles to be cleared before stocks can reach new highs. 

  Interest rates and corporate earnings are regarded as the key levers that could lift, or drop, the market out of the range that has held it spellbound since February. 

  Fears that inflation will resurface as the economy recovers have kept long-term interest rates stubbornly high, while the slow-motion recovery hasn't yet produced the corporate profits that could spur the market higher. 

  Inflation fears subsided somewhat today, sending interest rates slightly lower. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond eased to just under 8.44%. 

  But earnings have yet to show any evidence of strength. Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody, said the market will have trouble making sustainable gains with profit reports arriving in force next week. 

  The final Dow Jones Industrial average close was 2,980.77, up 21.02.  There were 1,016 issues advancing, 499 declining and 553 unchanged. 

  Volume totaled 173,060,000 shares, compared with 157,680,000 shares yesterday. 

  The NYSE Composite index was 208.17, up 1.63.  The average price per share rose 28 cents. 

  American Stock Exchange volume totaled 9,290,000 shares, compared with 9,560,000 yesterday.  There were 308 issues advancing, 234 declining and 229 unchanged. The average price per share rose 7 cents.

93,"Greenspan Reappointment Signals Steady Stance

 
   By Laurence Bauman and Kevin Donovan 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- The reappointment of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman has eclipsed the impact of politically motivated demands on the central bank to lower interest rates. 

  The reappointment also appears to ensure that the Fed will maintain the gradualistic approach to monetary policy that has become its hallmark. 

  As the recession deepened throughout the fall and winter, the Fed came under criticism from Congress, economists and bond market participants for not easing monetary rapidly or sharply enough. 

  But with the economy starting to rebound, it is becoming apparent that by easing policy slowly and over a protracted period, the Fed avoided putting itself in the position of having to reverse course and tighten policy, which would choke off the recovery. 

  ""The Fed hoped that if they stopped easing quickly enough, they wouldn't have to reverse themselves"" and start tightening in the early stages of the recovery, says Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. 

  While the economy is showing clear signs of rebounding, ""they won't have to change direction because they didn't overdo it in easing,"" Johnson adds. 

  ""They were cautious about easing,"" and that has contributed to a moderate recovery that currently isn't threatening to fuel a rebound in inflation, says Gary Schlossberg, economist at Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco. 

  ""They're not stepping on the accelerator,"" says Schlossberg, who expects the rebound to be ""a little weaker than the norm"" for a post-recessionary period. 

  Moreover, adds Schlossberg, ""the political heat is off the Fed,"" given the reappointment of Greenspan and the Senate Banking Committee's approval of the nominations of Fed Gov.  David Mullins as vice chairman and Lawrence Lindsey as a member of the Board. 

  The addition of Lindsey to the Fed isn't expected to change the central bank's approach to policy. 

  ""It's hard to view him as more dovish than Martha Seger,"" the recently resigned Fed governor, says Johnson.

95,"Greenspan Says M2 Growth- Zero Inflation May Clash

 

  WASHINGTON -DJ- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan acknowledged that 6.5% M2 growth is not compatible with achieving zero inflation over time. 

  Greenspan conceded this point at a House Domestic Policy subcommittee hearing at which he announced the Fed's provisional M2 growth target for 1992 at 2.5%-6.5%. 

  Subcommittee chairman Stephen Neal, D-N.C., said that target, particularly the upper end, strikes him as totally incompatible with price stability. 

  Greenspan said Neal is correct over the long run. 

  At some point, Fed Chairman Greenspan said, the Fed will make ""a final downward notch, a small one"" to create the sort of monetary target ranges consistent with eliminating inflation as a factor in the decisions of businesses. 

  Earlier, the Fed chairman indicated that ""inflation of 1%-1.5% would be synonymous with zero inflation."" 

  Rep. Neal supports legislation, which the Fed has backed, to erect zero-inflation as the appropriate goal of monetary policy. 

  Greenspan said there's no need at present to set timetables to achieve the zero-inflation goal. 

  Greenspan told the subcommittee that he thinks he knows how information on the Fed's M2 target for 1992 was leaked to the press, and voiced hope he has plugged the leak. 

  The Wall Street Journal first reported the Federal Open Market Committee adopted the 2.5% to 6.5 target range for 1992.

96,"Showa Shell Pretax Profit Rose 142% In The First Half

 

  TOKYO -DJ- Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., a leading Japanese oil refiner and distributor affiliated with the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Cos., said its pretax profit rose 142 pc in the first half. 

  A company spokesman credited strong sales and an increase in the portion of oil the company distributed that it refined itself. 

  The company reported a pretax profit of 25.58 billion yen, compared with 10.58 billion yen a year ago.  Net profit rose 99 pc to 13.78 billion yen from 6.92 billion yen in the same period last year.  Sales rose 7.8 pc to 799.25 billion yen from 741.48 billion yen and earnings per share rose 20 pc to 3.0 yen from 2.5 yen a year ago. 

  Domestic sales of Showa Shell's oil products rose by 783,000 kiloliters, or 5.2 pc, from the previous six-month term, the spokesman said.  Profits were bouyed by a strong demand for gasoline. 

  The company was able to raise wholesale oil-product prices as costs climbed with the onset of the Persian Gulf war, the spokesman said.  Prior to that, Japanese oil firms had absorbed cost increases, and profit margins sagged. 

  Showa Shell raised its 1991 sales projections 1.3 pc to 1.62 trillion yen, from 1.60 trillion.  Pretax profit projections were revised downward 12 pc to 40 billion yen, from 45 billion yen.  Net profit projections were lowered 20 pc to 20 billion yen, from 25 billion yen. 

  The company didn't offer an explanation for the revised projections.

  BAGHDAD -AP- One year after the economic embargo was clamped on Iraq, relief officials say they fear famine will devastate the country even if sanctions are immediately eased to allow the purchase of food. 

  Some believe there could be food riots or mass migration within three months. 

  ""People are eating bread, and/or rice, and vegetables.  No meat, or maybe meat once a month,"" said Douglas Broderick, the representative for Catholic Relief Services in Iraq. 

  In addition to shortages and soaring inflation that puts the price of food out of reach for many Iraqis, officials say there is no seed stock to plant crops next year. 

  ""I think that at this point we can take no further risks. We have to give priority to the human aspects of this crisis,"" Bernt Bernander, the administrator of the United Nations humanitarian reielf program, said in an interview yesterday. 

  Broderick said the food being brought in equals just 30 to 50 days worth, in a country that imported 70% of its food before the invasion of Kuwait. 

  He predicted the real crisis would begin in October or November. 

  ""You might have food riots.  You might have massive migration. You might have people breaking into store windows to get some food,"" Broderick said.  ""You have an iceberg, and there's nothing in the world to stop it.""

  MOSCOW -AP- The Russian Federation, endowed with more than half the Soviet Union's oil and gas reserves, wants to negotiate with other republics an increase in domestic energy prices, according to news reports. 

  The independent Interfax news agency said Russian President Boris Yeltsin made the announcement yesterday to oil workers in the Tyumen region, part of his weeklong tour of western Siberian oil and gas fields. 

  Yeltsin also granted certain Siberian energy producers the right to sell 25 pc of their resources at market prices beginning Sept. 1, a Russian government spokesman said. 

  Some of the profits, estimated at one billion rubles ($1.7 billion) annually in the Tomsk region alone, would be used to build houses and hospitals and help low-income people, the official Tass news agency reported. 

  Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying he wants oil price talks to begin with other republics after the signing of a new Union Treaty, which would reconstitute the country as a loose federation. 

  Republics refusing to sign will be charged world prices, Yeltsin said. 

  Members of a new Siberian Agreement Association will be permitted to sell up to one-quarter of their oil and gas at market prices, either domestically or overseas, said Leonid Batalin of the Russian Council of Ministers. 

  Batalin said in an interview the Russian government might set limits on the amount of resources that could be sold abroad, to ensure an adequate energy supply within its own borders.

  WASHINGTON -DJ- The Congressional Budget Office increased its estimate of the fiscal year 1992 budget deficit to $362 billion from its earlier estimate of $294 billion. 

  For fiscal year 1991, it revised its estimate downward to $279 billion from $309 billion. 

  The revision, as expected, were largely in line with the White House's revised budget deficit figures released last month.  Following the release of the figures, which estimated a $348.3 billion deficit, up from its earlier $280.9 billion figure, CBO Director Robert Reischauer said that he expected the CBO revision to be similar to those released from the White House. 

  The CBO and White House revisions both reflected weaker-than-expected revenue estimates, due to an overestimation of personal income. 

  The CBO projects that the total budget deficit will ""drop back sharply in 1993,"" following the 1991 and 1992 increases. Last year's total deficit was $220 billion. 

  The CBO report said that three factors - spending to resolve bank and thrift failures, cost of Operation Desert Storm, and the 1990-91 recession and pending economic recovery - contribute to the ""up and down"" pattern of the deficit. Excluding the temporary factors, the underlying deficit is projected to stabilize in the range of $170 billion to $190 billion over the next several years, the report said. It went on to say that in relation to the size of the economy, ""such deficits are no better than those of the late 1980s and considerably worse than the average of the 1960s and 1970s."" 

  The CBO said that its projections assumed that the economy is in a recovery phase, but will be moderate by historical standards, projecting real gross national product of 3.4% in calendar year 1992 and the average of 2.6% per year between 1993 and 1996.  The CBO also projects that inflation would be lower following the recession and that short term interest rates will rise slightly during the recovery. 

  -0- 

  Even though the CBO now foresees a wider deficit in each of the next five years than it did just five months ago, it argued in a new 112-page report that last year's deficit-reduction law is working. ""This deterioration in the budget outlook doesn't reflect an erosion of last year's hard-won savings and would have occurred even if the 1990 . . . bill had not been enacted,"" the CBO said. ""Without the spending cuts and tax increases enacted last year, the situation would be considerably worse."" 

  The office attributed the increase in its 1992 deficit estimate to changes in its economic forecast, higher costs in the Medicaid health-care program for the poor, added spending in the near term on deposit insurance and less revenue than anticipated. 

  Two-thirds of the changes in the revenue forecasts for the next few years result from the fact that the office now anticipates slower economic growth and a lower inflation rate. The balance reflects its realization that tax collections so far this year are lower than expected. 

  After the administration reduced its revenue forecasts, critics of last year's budget law seized on the changes as proof that the tax increases it ordered were counterproductive.  But in its new report, the CBO attacked this argument, saying that the lower projections for tax receipts reflect a slowdown in personal-income growth that predates the tax increases. 

  The CBO also said it believes the economy ""has now moved out of recession and into recovery, but that the ensuing expansion will be moderate by historical standards.""

101,"Analysts See Bank Of Canada Rate Little Changed Tomorrow

 
   By Rose Tamburri 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  OTTAWA -DJ- Signs of an economic turnaround and some high-profile labor disputes are expected to help keep the Bank of Canada's bank rate little changed tomorrow from its current level of 8.78 pc, money-market analysts said. 

  John McCarthy, chief money-market dealer with Toronto Dominion Bank said encouraging economic data, such as the 0.9-pc gain in June's leading economic indicator, plus lingering inflation pressures have made the Bank of Canada more cautious about lowering short-term rates. 

  The bank rate, the levy the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions, is set weekly at 25 basis points above the average yield on three-month treasury bills at the Thursday auction.  The rate fell only two basis points last week. 

  ""With signs of an incipient recovery underway, monetary officials have adopted a more cautious stance as they assess wage and price developments,"" said Bank of Nova Scotia economists Aron Gampel and David Rosenberg. 

  Labor disputes involving Canadian postal workers and government employees also are likely to cause the central bank to ""hold the line on further interest-rate declines,"" said Ted Carmicheal, senior economist at Burns Fry Ltd. 

  Rotating strikes by Canada's 46,000 postal employees entered the 12th day today with little sign of an agreement being reached between the two sides.  The Public Service Alliance of Canada, the union representing 150,000 Canadian government employees, said it will reveal on Friday the date of the anticipated strike by its members.

  FRANKFURT -DJ- Guenter Storch, a member of the Deutsche Bundesbank's directorate and policy-making Central Bank Council, said that the deutsche mark is being hurt by ""homemade"" factors which also threaten to boost inflation. 

  ""The exchange rate of the mark is also being burdened by homemade influences,"" Storch said.  ""Among these are high budget deficits as well considerable problems of adjustment in Eastern Germany,"" he added. 

  In addition, Storch pointed to the recent rapid reduction of the German current account surplus, which this year slid into deficit after years of record surpluses, as a factor 

undermining the German currency.   He said that the dollar is being helped by ""favorable expectations for economic growth in the U.S."" 

  Storch also said the Deutsche mark must remain the anchor of the European monetary system (EMS). 

  This comes at a time when key European finance officials are meeting in Brussels to decide on the conditions for the next step in the process of European monetary union. 

  At the world congress of the International Union of Housing Finance Institutions, Storch said that a confidence-building step in EMU would be to give European central banks greater independence from their governments and to make price stability one of their tenets.  He did not make any specific recommendations about the EMU talks. 

  He also repeated the Bundesbank's stance that the mark's anchor role in the European monetary system means that the it must remain committed to preserving price stability. 

  ""A committment to preserve price stability in Germany is therefore not only a national, but also a European task,"" Storch said.

  FRANKFURT -DJ- The cut in the U.S.  discount rate makes it even less likely than before that the Bundesbank will be forced to raise key German interest rates in coming months, economists say. 

  Fears of a German rate increase were already subsiding before the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate to 5.0 pc from 5.5 pc, the analysts said. 

  Western Germany's feverish economy has already begun to cool, while the region's money-supply growth and inflation appear under control, economists said.  Those developments damped speculation that the German central bank might increase its key 9.25 pc Lombard rate again this year. 

  Expectations of a German interest rate cut ""had diminished in the last few days, anyway,"" said Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. 

  ""My feeling is that (German) inflation will wane in the coming months as the German economy slows down,"" said Nigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel & Co. in London.  ""Therefore, the chances of another Bundesbank rate increase in the coming months is very small indeed."" 

  The move by the Fed will widen the existing spread between U.S. and German interest rates and thus support the Deutsche mark, a factor that will diminish imported inflation into Germany.

  NEW YORK -DJ- The consumer price index is expected to have risen 0.4 pc in August, with CPI excluding food and energy prices - the core rate of inflation - seen as having increased 0.3 pc, according to the average estimate of 18 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. 

  The overall CPI was up 0.2 pc in both June and July, with the non-food and energy component posting a 0.4 pc rise in both months. 

  The August CPI will be released by the Labor Department Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. 

  ""The consumer price index, excluding its food and energy components, has not performed as well as the PPI (producer price index),"" writes Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. The overall PPI was down 0.2 pc in July and down 0.3 pc in June, with the non-food and energy PPI posting a 0.2 pc increase in July, after being unchanged in June.  The August PPI will be released tomorrow. 

  ""So far this year, the core CPI has risen at an annual rate of 4.8 pc,"" Schaja adds. ""We expect it to decelerate to 4 pc"" by the end of the year. 

  In 1990, the overall CPI rose 6.1 pc, and was up 5.2 pc if food and energy prices are excluded. 

  ""The story with the CPI is apparel prices,"" says Raymond Stone, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.  Stone says that apparel prices tend to post sharp increases as the new fall lines are introduced into stores without any discounts. 

  In July, apparel prices were up 0.9 pc, following a 0.1 pc decline the previous month, when summer items were being discounted.  The August apparel price increase isn't expected to be as sharp as July's. 

  Estimates for the August CPI range from increases of 0.3 pc to 0.5 pc, which was the same range for the projections for the non-food and energy CPI.

  TOKYO -DJ- The Bank of Japan  released its prediction that the broad measure of money supply, M2 plus certificates of deposit, would grow between 2 pc and 3 pc in the October-to-December quarter. 

  The prediction follows growth of 2.8 pc in the July-to-September term and 3.7 pc growth in the quarter before that. Japan's money supply growth has been declining steadily since it peaked at 13.2 pc in April and May of 1990. 

  ""There has, on balance, not been a significant tightening of corporate financing"" arising from the most recent declines in growth rates, the bank said as it issued the prediction.  It said that companies are fulfilling their need for capital by drawing on their own reserves, issuing bonds, or stepping up borrowing from so-called 'non-bank' lenders. 

  The central bank said it would maintain a ""cautious"" monetary policy stance centered on price stability.  That echoed statements by Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno earlier today to a securities industry group, in which he added that the central bank can't yet be ""optimistic"" about recent easing in some price pressures. 

  The central bank said Japanese wholesale prices would likely continue to show stability, reflecting low petroleum prices, and an easing of demand pressure due to the slowing pace of economic growth. 

  Slowing money supply growth in Japan may bottom out in October, a Bank of Japan official said. 

  The official was briefing reporters after the central bank released its prediction on t money supply growth. 

  The official said he believes the predicted level of money supply growth won't trigger a sharp economic slowdown.

  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce estimated that the CPI rose 5.5 pc in September and that the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 5.8 pc.  In August, the core rate was up 5.9 pc. 

  Paul Babirad, a Royal Bank of Canada economist, estimated the year-over-year increase in the September CPI was 5.6 pc. The inflation rate, excluding the impact of the goods and services, was up 4 pc from a year earlier, he estimated. 

  ""The Canadian money market should be encouraged by this month's report but will no doubt face continued resistance from the Bank of Canada,"" he said.

108,"British Steel To Raise Price Of Basic Products By 4-5%

 

  LONDON -DJ- British Steel PLC said it intends to cut rebates on its basic products Jan. 1, raising prices by between 4% and 5%. 

  The U.K. steelmaker cited the need to maintain investment. 

  The company said it would reduce rebates on hot-rolled coil, and on the products made from that basic product, by 10 pounds to 15 pounds a metric ton.  With rebates, a ton of hot-rolled coil costs customers just under 200 pounds a ton. 

  Competition among world producers to offer ever more attractive rebates has lowered steel prices by 20% over the past two years, according to British Steel.  At the same time, costs have risen by 15 pc, it said, and can be expected to rise further. 

  A big reason is the dollar's strengt in foreign exchange markets. 

  Crucial products that British Steel imports from abroad, including iron and coal, are priced in dollars.  Forward contracts have protected the company so far from the dollar's 12% rise against the pound since January.  But British Steel should feel the full weight of those changes when the protective contracts run out at the beginning of next year. 

  Meanwhile, British Steel needs to invest several hundred million pounds a year to stay competitive, the company said. In July, British Steel said it made capital investments totalling 459 million pounds during 1990-1991 financial year and expected to make 325 million pounds in investments in the current year. 

  A spokesman noted, for example, the company plans to build a plate mill at Teesside in northeastern England. 

  The spokesman said he couldn't reveal the company's exact margins, but said the information would be contained in the company's interim results to be released Nov. 11.

109,"Fed&apos;s Parry Says Recession Over, On Path To Recovery

 

  NEW YORK -DJ- Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said ""I think that the recession is over and that we're on the path to recovery."" 

  Parry, in a speech at California State University, Fullerton, Calif., said the rise in oil prices and the Gulf War, which he identified as the causes of the recession, ""are largely behind us now."" 

  In addition, he said the drop in interest rates since July of last year ""should add strength to economic activity, especially in housing and consumer durables."" 

  Also adding strength to the recovery is the lack of an inventory overhang, he said. 

  ""We may be getting a glimpse of some of these effects,"" he said. 

  ""Economic activity was roughly unchanged in the second quarter, an improvement over the decline registered in the prior six months. 

  ""Although this isn't conclusive evidence, it appears that the economy expanded at a more robust pace in the third quarter just ended."" 

  Parry's comments were contained in a text of the speech made available to reporters. 

  San Francisco Fed President Parry says the recession might not ""feel"" like it's over because the transition to expansion occurs at the bottom of the business cycle when levels of economic activity are low. 

  Also, the recovery ""so far has been concentrated mainly in the industrial sector, rather than in the broad services sector."" 

  He says the recovery is likely to be moderate because of cutbacks in government spending, overbuilding in commercial real estate, and less credit extension from financial intermediaries. 

  ""Naturally, weak bank and thrift credit helps explain why the Fed's main monetary aggregate, M2, now stands at the lower boundary of its 1991 target range,"" he said. 

  However, Parry also said: ""It's too soon to tell how much the reduction in total credit is affecting the strength of the expansion."" 

  Turning to inflation, Parry said the drop in oil prices and the strength of the dollar has helped stem the tide, ""although a good deal of this may be temporary."" 

  ""Factors affecting underlying inflation are far more important for the long term. In this area, the situation is uncertain."" 

  He said slack in the labor and product markets should restrain growth in labor compensation before long, but he added that ""we haven't seen significant improvement in the data yet."" 

  ""Overall, however, I wouldn't be surprised to see consumer inflation of around 3 pc both this year and next,"" he added. 

  The Fed's Parry said he expected the economy to grow much more slowly than in previous recoveries, probably around 3 pc in the first year of the recovery. 

  Meanwhile, he said transition periods from recession to recovery are ""especially risky times"" for policy makers. ""For one thing, they're a time when signals often are quite mixed,"" he said. ""They're also a time when it's natural to be overly pessimistic about the strength of the recovery."" 

  ""This may explain why there have been too many times when policy has eased well after the trough has passed,"" he said. And when the Fed has been overly aggressive in its easing of monetary policy, ""unsustainable growth and eventually painful struggles with inflation"" usually follow, he said. 

  Parry emphasized the Fed's role as an inflation fighter, saying that although the Fed ""should facilitate the recovery, (it) cannot lose sight of (its) longer-term goal, which is to control, and ultimately eliminate, inflation.""

   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  HONOLULU -DJ- First Hawaiian Inc.'s profit growth in the second half of 1991 won't match the 20 pc clip set in the first six months, but the bank holding company will still post record earnings for the year in part because the mainland's recession hasn't spread to Hawaii, Chairman Walter Dods told Dow Jones. 

  Analysts expect First Hawaiian to earn between $19 million and $21 million, or 60 cents to 65 cents per share, in the third period ended Sept.  30, versus $18.5 million, or 60 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Dods would not comment on these projections, but he said quarterly results, to be released Oct. 17, would also be a record. 

  He noted that ""anything over 60 cents a share is record,"" adding that the company has 5.1 million more shares outstanding now than at this time last year. For the full year, analysts are looking for $82 million to $85 million, or $2.55 to $2.65 per share, compared with $71.5 million, or $2.45 per share, in 1990. 

  Despite a sharp decline in tourist arrivals during the Gulf War, Hawaii's economy will grow 2 pc this year, Dods said. ""In the first quarter, the Japanese stopped coming almost overnight, and that has fully recovered."" Still, the number of U.S.  mainland visitors continues to lag.  Through July, arrivals are off 5.5 pc, ""but that is catching up each month,"" he said. 

  Meanwhile, hotel occupancy is down about 10 pc to a current 79.5 pc. Dods attributed the slump to roughly 3,000 luxury hotel rooms built in the past year or so. Giant resorts are suffering the most, he said, but precise figures on this category are not available. 

  In contrast to its mainland brethren, First Hawaiian has few problem real estate loans.  Nonperformers total just 0.62 pc of total loans and leases, up from 0.46 pc last quarter. That is a mere blip compared with the industry average of 5.7 pc, according to Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 

  The low level of problem loans is the result of lending mainly in its own backyard. On a loan portfolio in excess of $4 billion, First Hawaiian has just $73 million in California real estate loans, $7 million of which is nonperforming. ""That helps me sleep,"" Chairman Dods said. 

  Unlike California, ""Hawaii's real estate prices, knock on wood, are still holding. But there is a softening on the luxury home and megaresort side,"" he said. The reason for this is that Japanese investor interest has cooled and Japanese banks have pulled back from the Hawaiian market. 

  Dods said that First Hawaiian's torrid profit growth will abate in the second half because its net interest margin is under pressure. That's partly because lending rates adjust downwards more quickly than the interest rates banks pay depositors. Further, the bank is trying to increase market share, offering a passbook rate of 5.5 pc, versus the 5 pc rate of its slightly larger chief rival, Bancorp Hawaii. First Hawaiian already has 39 pc of the state's total bank deposits. 

  The wave of intrastate mergers currently sweeping the banking industry are driven by the hope of operating cost savings of 35 pc or more. But Dods thinks this expectation is too optimistic, at least at his bank.  Having recently completed the acquisition of First Interstate of Hawaii Inc., First Hawaiian should realize cost savings of just 25 pc, or $12 million annually by 1993, he said.

111,"E. German Cost-Of-Living For October Rose 10% Vs September

 

  FRANKFURT -DJ- The Federal Statistic Office said the partial deregulation of rental prices at the beginning of October in the former East German area loosed a 10 pc surge in consumer prices in the month in the region. 

  The agency also said the cost-of-living index in the five new Eastern German states rose 26.1 pc compared with October 1990. 

  The now-defunct East German communist government kept housing rents frozen at 1936 levels, a situation that didn't change substantially until October. 

  Stripping out rental costs and costs for heating, which were also deregulated, the cost-of-living in the region rose only 0.3 pc in the month. 

  The October cost-of-living figures compare with September increases of 0.2 pc in the month and 16.6 pc in the year. 

  The price deregulation went into effect Oct. 1.  Rents were raised within limits established by government authorities, but weren't fully deregulated. 

  Breaking out the price components, rents for older apartments built prior to 1948 rose 344.4 pc in October from September, and those built after 1948 posted rent increases of 283 pc in the one-month period, the agency said.

  Like the rest of the industry, Shell's results reflect oil prices significantly lower than those a year ago when the Persian Gulf crisis pushed crude oil prices skyward. Shell said that, on average, crude oil was $5 a barrel lower for the 1991 quarter than for the 1990 period. 

  At the same time, Shell is restructuring to rejuvenate its moribund refining and marketing operations and bolster company profits.  That plan includes a pact to sell its 68-year-old Carson, Calif., refinery to Unocal Corp. of Los Angeles.  That proposed transaction meant a $60 million third-quarter charge. 

  In addition, the company was one of four major oil companies that agreed in August to pay $45 million each to settle a 16-year-old price-fixing dispute with the city of Long Beach and the state of California. With the others, Shell denied any wrongdoing, saying it settled to avoid additional litigation costs. The charge for settling was $30 million.

  Minutes of the Oct. 1 FOMC meeting show that at the time the committee members felt that the economic data at the time ""was consistent with a continuing though still sluggish recovery in economic activity and that the prospects remain favorable for a sustained expansion at a moderate pace over the next several quarters."" 

  But many committee members felt ""that the risks to  the expansion appeared to be tilted at least marginally to the downside."" 

  Moreover, several FOMC members indicated that they were ""uneasy about the potential implications of the ongoing weakness in the broad measures of money and credit."" 

  In the committee discussions of the growth of the monetary aggregates and credit, it was pointed out that there had been ""a significant restructuring of household and business balance sheets"" and that this restructuring was reflected in the monetary aggregates. 

  ""Slow growth in broader money and credit did not necessarily indicate that monetary policy was being too restrictive by damping the expansion of incomes or curtailing demands for goods and services,"" the minutes state. 

  The minutes also show that the FOMC ""continued to view the outlook for inflation as favorable"" and that the expected moderate rate of economic expansion would ""accommodate further downward adjustments in the underlying rate of inflation."" The minutes also show that the relatively slow pace of money growth ""would tend to foster lower inflation while providing liquidity sufficient to sustain a moderate rate of economic expansion.""

114,"Discount Rate Cut Shows Fed&apos;s Concern Over Economy

 
   By Laurence Bauman 
   Dow Jones Staff Reporter 
 

  NEW YORK -DJ- The Federal Reserve showed how concerned it is about the health of the economy by easing monetary policy in the most visible means available to it - a reduction in the discount rate. 

  The Fed's move pushed the discount rate to 4.5% from 5%, where it had stood since Sept.  13. 

  The move comes only a week after the Fed eased policy by lowering the Federal Funds rate 25 basis points to 5%, and implies that the Funds rate will be lowered by an additional 25 basis points, analysts say. 

  The move was widely anticipated, although the timing caught market participants by surprise, coming as it did in the middle of a Treasury refunding. 

  ""I think it's unprecedented,"" to cut the discount after the start of a quarterly refunding, says Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities. 

  Nonetheless, ""it should have happened, and is a bit overdue,"" he adds. 

  ""This keeps (the Fed) on track toward lower rates, and until there are signs of economic strength, it will continue,"" says Slifer. 

  ""The question is whether we're at 4.75% on Funds,"" says Henry Engler, economist at Chemical Bank. ""My guess is that we are."" 

  Almost every policy shift by the Fed under the leadership of Chairman Alan Greenspan has involved a 25-basis-point move in the Funds rate, including last week's move down to 5%. 

  Federal Funds currently are changing hands at 4.75%, after opening the day at 5%, prior to the discount rate cut announcement. 

  The pace at which the Federal Reserve has instituted policy easings has clearly been increased, reflecting the central bank's growing concern about the economy's ability to sustain its faltering recovery from recession. 

  Today's discount rate cut comes only a week after the Fed lowered the Federal Funds target to 5%. Many of the Fed's previous easings had come with intervals of at least a month. 

  If, as is widely expected, the Fed's new Fed Funds rate target is 4.75%, ""that gives us 50 basis points in two weeks,"" says Slifer of Lehman.  ""They have speeded up the pace."" 

  Since late summer, when the economy showed signs of rebounding, market participants viewed each easing of monetary policy as the last move the Fed would need to make. 

  But that perception has changed, and there is a growing outlook that the easing of policy undertaken today will be followed by other moves toward lower rates. 

  ""I think we have more cuts in store,"" adds Slifer. 

  He contends that as long as the Fed Funds rate is above the rate of inflation, ""it is not terribly stimulative."" 

  Slifer says the Funds rate could eventually move as low as 3%. 

  ""The view that the economic recovery looks a good deal more uncertain is a major contributor"" to the perception that the Fed will have to ease further, says Engler of Chemical Bank. 

  But Engler doubts the next move will come imminently. 

  ""The Fed will certainly want to adopt a wait-and-see approach"" before easing again, Engler says. ""They'll want to see how the fourth quarter will shape up."" 

  Engler also says there is a potential roadblock to further Fed easing. If ""the fourth quarter continues to come in poorly, there will be a tendency (by the Bush Administration) to move toard fiscal stimulus. That may keep the Fed from doing anything more on the policy front,"" he says. 

  The combination of a tax cut with huge budget deficits and an easier monetary policy is widely seen as a sure-fire means of fueling inflation.

115,"U.K. Oct. Producer Output Prices Rose 5.2% From Yr Ago

 

  LONDON -DJ- British producer output prices rose an unadjusted 5.2 pc in October from a year earlier and 0.2 pc from September, while producer input prices fell 1.7 pc from a year ago but rose 0.6 pc from September, the U.K.  Central Statistical Office said. 

  Market forecasters had expected output prices to rise 5.3 pc from a year ago and 0.3 pc from September.  Input prices were seen fallen 0.2 pc from September. 

  After seasonal adjustment, input prices rose 0.4 pc in October from September and were down 1.8 pc from October 1990.  That compares with September's 0.4 pc monthly fall and 2.9 pc yearly fall and forecasts for a 0.1 pc monthly rise and 2.2 pc year-on-year fall. 

  Output prices, excluding food, tobacco and drink, rose 0.2 pc an unadjusted basis in October from September and were up 4.2 pc from a year earlier. 

  The statistics office noted that the 4.2 pc rise was the lowest since April 1987, when it also rose 4.2 pc.  The year-on-year rate peaked at 6.5 pc in January and February this year. 

  The Treasury welcomed the slowdown in output price inflation, noting that the decline in the year-on-year rate for all manufacturing to 5.2 pc from 5.7 pc in September was the biggest monthly fall observed since March 1986. 

  The Treasury suggested that the sharp fall in output price inflation shows that underlying inflation pressure in Britain is continuing to decline.  It added that this should feed through into further reductions in retail price inflation over the coming months.

116,"Bundesbank - Inflation -2-: Threatens Growth, Employment

 

  FRANKFURT -DJ- In yet another warning to Germany's labor unions, the Deutsche Bundesbank said wage-driven inflation in 1992 could be ""hard to combat and demands all the more harsh retaliation."" 

  ""The few demands for the round of 1992 wage talks that we know about are in the same dimensions as in 1991, although the economic environment - in part because of wage increases - has considerably worsened,"" the German central bank said in its December monthly report. 

  ""With the slowing of growth there isn't as much room to distribute (profits) as in there was in the previous two years,"" it added. 

  Year-on-year wage growth was around 6.5 pc-7 pc in November, the Bundesbank noted. Consumer prices were up around 4 pc in November. 

  While warning the ""wage talk partners"" that Western Germany's economic growth has slowed, the Bundesbank said it ""wouldn't be correct to speak of recessionary tendencies."" 

  Viewed over the long term, production at many Western German companies is going stronger than average, and employment is relatively healthy, the Bundesbank noted. 

  But in a broad context, a wage-price spiral ""doesn't just bode risks to price stability; even in the medium-term it dampens prospects for growth and employment as well,"" it said. 

  The Bundesbank called on employers and unions to avoid the continuation of a wage-price spiral and build a ""solid basis for long-term, stress-free economic growth.""

117,"Morgan Stanley Japan Unit To Co-Lead NTT Domestic Debt Issue

 

  TOKYO -DJ- Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., Japan's telecommunications giant, said it plans to include Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s Japanese unit as a co-leader of a domestic debt issue. 

  This is apparently the first time that a foreign securities house will co-lead a domestic issue for a major Japanese borrower. 

  Morgan Stanley will help lead the issue with Nomura Securities Co. to help NTT start to price its bonds more in line with the market rather than relying on set prices from securities houses that in turn have to selectively discount the paper to retail it. 

  The new kind of pricing, in use in Europe and the U.S., may help introduce transparency as well into the Japanese corporate bond market to help lure issuers and investors back from the Euromarket. 

  However, efficient pricing and greater participation from investors are necessary to increase the local market's capacity, dealers contend. 

  NTT's offering of domestic bonds is likely this week, John S. Wadsworth Jr., president of Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd., said. 

  The size and maturities of NTT's past domestic issues suggest an offering would be in the range of 50 billion yen approaching 10-years. The floatation would introduce ""negotiated fixed-price reoffering"" to Japan's domestic corporate straight-bond issue market. 

  Nomura Securities Co. will ""run the book,"" or keep track of the syndication, for NTT's issue. 

  In the U.S. and Europe, underwriters check demand before pricing an issue, then offer the issue at one price to all investors for an initial term. 

  Currently, in Japan the lead manager bids to the issuer for an offering, then places it at varying prices, often selectively discounted. 

  -0- 

  The NTT bond issue is also a coup for Morgan Stanley Group's Morgan Stanley & Co. 

  ""Up until now it has been hard for us to determine the appropriate price for our bonds,"" said Toyoaki Ukita, senior manager for NTT's finance division. ""The fixed-price method will make things clear.  If that encourages more investors to buy NTT bonds, it will minimize our long-range capital costs."" 

  Morgan Stanley and Nomura will each receive a 30%, or 15 billion yen, share of the offering. Morgan has never had more than a 1% share of a straight Japanese domestic bond issue. 

  The success of the issue will be tested as early as Wednesday, when underwriters are expected to begin selling to investors. But longer-term evaluation will depend on whether the bond is traded among investors in the secondary market. 

  Other managers in the NTT syndicate include Yamaichi Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co., Kankaku Securities Co., New Japan Securities Co. and Kokusai Securities Co. The 25 other syndicate members with smaller shares include five other foreign securities houses: Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., S.G.  Warburg Securities Japan Inc., Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp., Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.  and Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. 

  Because the companies don't discount the bonds, the 0.65 yen commission that underwriters charge for each 100 yen of face value may actually result in greater commission revenue than Japanese securities houses have usually seen from corporate bond underwriting. 

  Ukita expressed confidence in the proposed offering's success but acknowledged the risk that investors in Japan may not immediately take to the fixed-price system.

  NEW YORK -DJ- This year's good news is that inflation is down and next year it should be steady to lower, says Paul Boltz, financial economist at T.  Rowe Price Associates Inc. 

  The inflation decline ""is about the only good that comes out of recessions,"" he says.  Excluding food and energy, in 1990 the consumer inflation rate was 5.2 pc and so far this year it has been 3.9 pc - the decline coming as a result of falling energy prices. Boltz says ""unless the economic recovery is much weaker than we anticipate inflation next year should be in the 3 1/2 to 4 pc area."" 

  T. Rowe Price expects that real Gross National Product on a fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter basis will be virtually unchanged this year and will grow about 2 3/4 pc in 1992. ""This would be roughly half the growth of other post-World War II recoveries"", Boltz said. 

  Looking forward, ""we believe the sluggish recovery will feel much like a recession through mid-1992. None the less, we think that consumers will gradually emerge from the gloom, as they always do, and the economy will resume more normal growth in the second half of next year,"" the T. Rowe Price economist said. 

  Boltz added that unless the recession impacts inflation more than expected, the Federal Reserve will return to a modest credit tightening pattern in the second half of 1992. Boltz was speaking at a T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. 1991 Investment/Economic Outlook seminar.

119,"OECD, UK -3-: Sees Improved Prospects For Low Inflation

 

  Since the third quarter, the OECD said the prospects in the U.K. for attaining sustained low inflation have improved as wage settlements dropped to levels below those of the early 1980s, when unemployment was considerably higher. 

  The growth of productivity has also picked up despite falling output, the study said, allowing for a ""slight decline"" in manufacturing unit labor costs. 

  ""The drive by industry to contain costs and moderate wage claims in response to lower inflation seems to represent changes in attitude,"" the OECD said.  ""Such changes are consistent with maintaining sterling's central rate within the EMS and could mean that the output and employment losses associated with achieving low inflation will be significantly smaller than in the past."" 

  Meanwhile, the OECD said macroeconomic policy ""remains oriented"" towards keeping sterling within its exchange rate mechanism bands and to the attainment of ""durably low"" inflation. 

  The report said the government's March 1991 budget was ""broadly neutral"" in cyclically adjusted terms, with a projected swing into a small deficit into fiscal year 1991-1992. 

  Meanwhile, the OECD said the government's latest autumn spending statement raised planned expenditure, including privatization proceeds, for the current fiscal year and will increase the share of general government expenditure in GDP by two percentage points over the two years to fiscal year 1992-1993. 

  ""Monetary policy remains tight,"" the report said.  ""The drop in base lending rates to 10.5 pc in August 1991 largely reflected coincident falls in inflation."" 

  The report went on to note that sterling has remained close to its central 2.95 Deutsche mark rate in the ERM over the past year.

121,"WSJ:Brazilian Currency Slide Is Halted Tues By Rise In Rates

 
  By Peter Fritsch 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The worrying slide of Brazil's currency stopped abruptly after the nation's central bank boosted interest rates in an effort to attract investment and discourage a spike in inflation. 

  But the situation remained tense, as thinly traded markets focused their attention on a key congressional vote scheduled for this afternoon and the political implications that higher interest rates could have on an economy already in deep recession. 

  After losing ground early, Brazil's currency, the real, rallied to finish its third day as a free-floating currency at 1.56 reals to the dollar, stronger than Monday's close of 1.59 reals to the dollar. The Brazilian currency has lost 22% of its value against the dollar since the central bank first moved to devalue the real a week ago. The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange's key Bovespa Index closed 267 points, or 3.8%, higher at 7380 in light trading. 

  Stocks have risen thanks in part to bottom fishing by foreign investors as share prices, quoted in dollar terms, traded at deep discounts. Indeed, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. said it was increasing its Brazil position in its model portfolio by unwinding positions in Chile and Peru. Stocks also rose on anticipation of congressional passage of an important pension-reform bill today. 

  Late Monday, Brazil's monetary policy committee raised the ceiling on benchmark interest rates to 41% from 36%. The central bank immediately backed up that move, lending overnight funds to banks at 32% yesterday, up from 29.8% Monday. Futures markets indicate rates could soon shoot up to 39%, near the 39.75% rate at which the Treasury sold one-year paper yesterday. Brazilian consumers pay annual interest rates of more than 100%. 

  The rate increase made good on Finance Minister Pedro Malan's promise earlier Monday that Brazil would defend its currency with higher rates -- at least for the short term. That action was supported by the International Monetary Fund and encouraged by Brazilian economists who feared President Fernando Henrique Cardoso might try to drop rates precipitously to gain political points with Brazil's badly bruised business establishment. 

  Mr. Malan is expected to elaborate on his policy plans today at a breakfast hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Among the commercial and investment bankers expected to attend are senior executives from Citigroup Inc., Chase Manhattan Corp., J.P. Morgan & Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 

  Because of a fat budget deficit, Brazil has external borrowing requirements estimated at more than $55 billion this year and needs to maintain rates attractive enough to coax that money from beyond its borders. Yet dollars keep leaving the country, even after the central bank said Friday it would stop spending its own hard currency cache to support the real. 

  Since then, dollar outflows are on a pace to average about $6.5 billion a month -- enough to wipe out Brazil's current dollar reserves by August (not including future disbursements from the remaining $32.5 billion in bailout funds available from the IMF and other lenders). 

  It isn't unusual for a country to raise interest rates following a currency devaluation in order to stem an outflow of hard currency. In Brazil's case, higher rates also represent a badly needed bridge between the shock of a change in exchange-rate policy and the so-far elusive return of investor confidence. Investors say the only way Brazil can shore up confidence is by delivering badly needed fiscal reforms. 

  Yesterday, Brazil's Senate voted as expected to increase and extend a tax on banking transactions -- a cornerstone of budget savings promised the IMF. That measure still needs to be approved in the lower house of Congress, where Mr. Cardoso has faced the most legislative resistance to reform. 

  A far greater test comes today, when Congress is scheduled to vote on a controversial measure to begin taxing retirees to shore up a bankrupt pension system. That measure has failed four times during the past four years, and an administration victory would be worth a lot more than the planned $2.6 billion in budgeted savings this year. 

  ""The importance of this vote for investor confidence and the real is hard to overstate,"" said Mauro Schneider, economist for ING Barings in Sao Paulo. Most analysts believe the government has the votes to pass the measure and will then aim to pass enabling legislation allowing states to reduce their bloated payrolls. 

  With such reforms under his belt, Mr. Cardoso will come under intense political and fiscal pressure to lower interest rates over the medium term. Not only do high rates tighten the stranglehold on the economy, but they also build on the government's massive domestic debt -- two thirds of which is indexed to interest rates. ""I think the pressure to lower interest rates will come more from the fiscal end than from the political end,"" said Jair Ribeiro, managing director of Banco Patrimonio de Investimento SA in Sao Paulo. 

  Officials here have said unofficially they hope to be able to drop overnight rates to below 20% by the end of March. Buttonholed by reporters, Central Bank President Franciso Lopes said the latest rate increase is only meant to be temporary.

  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--New Zealand Treasurer Bill Birch said Tuesday the current mix of the New Zealand dollar exchange rate and interest rates appears likely to remain favorable for ""some time"" ahead.

  ""The mix of exchange and interest rates appears favorable for some time ahead. As Treasurer, I am not about to predict the path for either the dollar or mortgages, but the Reserve Bank (of New Zealand) has signaled that monetary conditions will remain easier for some time and the latest consumer price index figure will help this,"" Birch said. 

  Inflation data for the fourth quarter of 1998 was much lower than economists had expected. The key consumer price index minus credit costs fell 0.1% from the third quarter, whereas economists' median expectation had been for a 0.4% rise. 

  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had projected in November fourth quarter inflation would be 0.5% and the sharply lower number encourages the market to belief that any tightening in monetary policy can be further deferred. 

  Birch noted the New Zealand dollar versus the U.S. dollar has dropped from a high of over US$0.70 in early 1997, to less than US$0.50 in (August) 1998 to around US$0.54 now. 

  ""That makes our goods much cheaper overseas and easier to sell and is why we have seen a huge pick-up in trade,"" Birch said. 

  He said economic data delivered through December 1998 and in January 1999 confirmed that, while the first half of 1998 was difficult, growth resumed strongly in September with New Zealand now having an excellent foundation for continuing growth.

123,"WRAP/Brazil&apos;s/Real -2: Odds On Permanent Free-Float

 
 

  Markets have now turned their attention to what permanent forex system Brazilian authorities will adopt and where the real will finally settle. 

  Finance Minister Pedro Malan, Central Bank President Francisco Lopes and top U.S. and International Monetary Fund authorities will gather in Washington over the weekend to discuss policy options. Although the Central Bank said it would release a communique Monday, there was some speculation an announcement would be made late Sunday to clear the air before markets open. 

  Most economists rule out the possibility of the Central Bank even attempting to return to the sort of rigid system that Brazil had clung to for the past four years. 

  Rather, they say the Central Bank will either stick to the free float or adopt an extremely wide band for the real. 

  'If I had to flip a coin, I'd say they're likely to go to flotation,' said Walter Stoeppelwerth, strategist for Robert Fleming Inc in Sao Paulo. He said arguments in favor of a wide band - which he put in the range of BRR1.35 or BRR1.40 to BRR1.70 - are to help establish expectations for interest rates and inflation. 

  Henry Willmore, senior economist at Barclays Capital in New York, said a free-float had been widely expected and would be well-received. 

  'Actually doing it sooner is a lot better because they haven't used all of their IMF money to defend the currency and can instead use it to manage the aftermath of the float,' Willmore said. 

  Brazil signed an agreement with the IMF in November to receive $41.5 billion in funds from international lenders.

124,"Malaysia Petronas/Output -2: Peg Eases Impact Of Low Prices

 
 

  KUALA LUMPUR (Dow Jones)--Malaysian national oil and gas corporation Petroliam Nasional Bhd. (P.PET), or Petronas, has no immediate plans to cut oil production even as it faces the lowest oil prices in 12 years, President and Chief Executive Mohd. Hassan Merican said Wednesday. 

  ""At the moment, we're not considering any reduction of (oil) production for the country,"" Hassan said in a news conference. 

  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad recently suggested that Malaysia may cut its oil production due to low oil prices. 

  Hassan added that as a small contributor to the world oil market, the company will continue to produce at its current level of around 630,000 barrels per day, of which 400,000 are for export. 

  Hassan noted that in ringgit (MYR) terms, the impact of the low oil prices on Malaysia is cushioned by the country's fixed exchange rate. 

  Capital controls imposed Sept 1., 1998, prohibited offshore trading of ringgit, effectively pegging the Malaysian currency at MYR3.80 to the U.S. dollar. 

  The policy was crafted to allow Malaysia's economic planners to pump more liquidity into the recession-hit economy without undermining the stability of the currency. 

  The ringgit can now only be exchanged on the current account for trade-related purposes.

125,"Greenspan Calls Econ Outstanding But Sees Overheating Risk

 
 
   By Joseph Rebello 
 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Wednesday the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating despite a global economic slump, suggesting the central bank isn't likely to cut interest rates again this year. 

  In testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, Greenspan said the U.S. economy produced an 'outstanding' performance in 1998, generating a rare combination of torrid growth and low inflation. But he said it must be cooled a little to ensure continued growth. 

  'Through the end of 1998, the economy continued to grow more rapidly than can be currently accommodated on an ongoing basis,' Greenspan said in prepared remarks. As a result 'some moderation in economic growth...might be required to sustain the expansion.' 

  The U.S. economy is expected to have grown at a 3.75% rate in 1998, resulting in the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history. That performance, bolstered by three Fed rate cuts, has stirred many Fed policy makers to warn that the growth could stoke inflation. Most economists, as a result, no longer expect the Fed to cut rates again this year. 

  Greenspan's testimony reinforced those expectations. Appearing before a Congressional committee for the first time since September, Greenspan said economic growth has shrunk the supply of U.S. workers willing to work who don't have jobs, a trend that could push labor costs up. Moreover, he said, the rise of U.S. stocks in recent months, which has contributed to economic growth, may be unsustainable. 

  'Everything he said suggested the Fed is going to be on hold for the remainder of the year,' said Josh Feinman, an economist with Bankers Trust in New York. 'The Fed has a pretty even balance of risks going forward: With the economy strong and financial markets stabilizing, the Fed wouldn't dream of easing (interest rates). At the same time, with inflation subdued, a tightening isn't on the table either.'

126,"U.S. Retail Gas Prices Fall One Penny Per Gallon - Lundberg

 
 

  CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP)--Gasoline prices plunged nearly a penny per gallon over the past two weeks, and they could go lower, says an industry analyst said Sunday. 

  The average price, including all grades and taxes, was $1.0141 per gallon on Friday, down .94 cent from two weeks earlier, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 

  When adjusted for inflation, that is the lowest price in the history of the retail gas market and follows months of declines linked to an oversupply of crude and refined oil products, Trilby Lundberg said Sunday. 

  ""The bigger picture does not suggest higher prices soon. In fact, the price crash may not be over,"" she said. 

  The faltering world economy weakened demand, she said. ""It had to do especially with the Asian economic crises, followed by those in Russia and parts of Latin America."" 

  The winter driving season in the U.S. also had lessened demand. 

  Retailers have responded by cutting their profit margins ""in order to chase sales,"" Ms. Lundberg said, adding that such reductions accounted for about half of the latest decline. 

  While bad news for gas station owners, the drops may help the overall economy, she added. ""Low prices may be indirectly encouraging retail sales of goods and services in general by encouraging consumers to drive."" 

  Average prices at self-service stations were 95.26 cents per gallon for regular gasoline, $1.0634 for mid-grade and $1.1487 for premium. 

  Full-service prices were $1.4155 for regular, $1.5075 for mid-grade and $1.5799 for premium.

127,"WSJ: Shareholder Scoreboard: Best- And Worst-Performing Companies: Best 1-Year Performer: Amazon.com Inc.

 
  By George Anders 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  Amazon.com Inc.'s headquarters are just above a discount clothing store in a somewhat seedy part of Seattle. The company's chief executive officer works at a makeshift desk assembled from a plywood door and some metal brackets. Losses last year topped $100 million, and top officials warn of more red ink this year. 

  If you think those traits make Amazon a stock-market flop, guess again. Last year Amazon shares surged 966%, the most of any of the 1,000 companies tracked in The Wall Street Journal's Shareholder Scoreboard. An investment of just $1,000 at the end of 1997 would have ballooned to $10,664 12 months later. Along the way, Amazon has become the archetype of an Internet success story: a company willing to post hefty losses while it achieves explosive growth in the brave new world of electronic commerce. 

  By the end of last year, more than six million people had visited Amazon's Web site and purchased books, music or videos. With a few clicks of a computer mouse, they picked out their favorites and then typed in their credit-card numbers as payment. Those orders whizzed into Amazon's warehouses, which then shipped the goods via mail or private shippers. All of a sudden, consumers had a new way to shop, without ever leaving the house or talking to a sales clerk. 

  For Jeffrey Bezos, Amazon's CEO, 1998 was the year his five-year-old way of doing business went from a minor high-tech curiosity to a part of mainstream American culture. ""Last year was all about comfort and familiarity,"" he says. ""People realized that shopping online wasn't just a novelty. It was a way of saving time and saving money."" 

  Amazon's most explosive growth came just before Christmas, when stressed-out shoppers decided that point-and-click at their home computers was a lot more fun than pushing and elbowing at the mall. ""It was a very good period for people to try us for the first time,"" Mr. Bezos says. Amazon achieved nearly 40% of its 1998 sales in the fourth quarter, as business nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier pace. 

  In most other industries, investor enthusiasm about Amazon's soaring sales would be tempered by severe worries about profitability. Bookselling in general is a low-margin business, as big merchants compete largely by offering customers sizable discounts to list price. Amazon opted to keep its prices low so it could pull in customers. That left little cushion to cover its overhead or massive marketing spending aimed at drawing new customers. 

  As an Internet-commerce play, however, Amazon has enjoyed wide leeway from investors to run up losses in the name of building sales and brand recognition. The opportunities to grab a commanding lead in cyberspace are too big to be passed up in the name of a short-term focus on profits, says Henry Blodget, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. ""I don't think {Amazon} will turn profitable until 2001 -- and they're right to do it that way,"" he says. 

  Skeptics argue that Amazon's losses may have no clear end in sight. Although Amazon was the first online bookstore, it now has dozens of rivals, including heavyweights such as Barnes & Noble Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Meanwhile, a relative newcomer, Buy.com Inc., has vowed to undercut Amazon's prices on all titles. 

  So far, Amazon has kept its dominant position in online bookselling while sales have grown rapidly in newer markets such as music, videos and overseas markets. But operating margins in those new sectors are even slimmer than in the domestic book market. Looking ahead, Amazon says it wants to offer customers an even wider range of goods online; it won't say whether it will make acquisitions or merely provide electronic links to other merchants. 

  At the very least, Amazon has bought a lot more time to continue its experiments. In January, the company sold $1.25 billion of convertible bonds at a trifling interest rate of 4.75%. That gives it a formidable cash hoard to cover operating losses, expansions and any acquisitions for years to come. 

  Amazon also may be on the brink of a major efficiency improvement by upgrading its warehouses and distribution, says Steve Horen, an analyst at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. A highly automated warehouse in Nevada is due to open this summer, he notes. By contrast, Amazon's Seattle warehouse requires employees to find each book ordered and pull it off a shelf. Paring down labor costs could bring Amazon much closer to profitability, Mr. Horen says. 

  What's more, Amazon's ability to do business in cyberspace lets it grow rapidly without tying up much cash. Its chief financial officer, Joy Covey, recently calculated that the company so far has spent just $36 million on physical assets. By contrast, if it were running physical stores, she says, it would have spent $650 million on leases for at least 200 facilities to achieve the same level of sales. 

  As Amazon pursues more growth, it is almost impossible to gauge whether the company has any hope of delivering welcome surprises to shareholders, given how much its stock already has surged. At current prices, Amazon is valued at 24 times annual sales, whereas rival Barnes & Noble sells at just twice its annual sales. 

  In a recent conference call with investors and analysts, Amazon's Mr. Bezos urged investors to make Amazon only a small part of their holdings and to focus on the company's long-term prospects rather than look for a quick killing in the stock. The company's growth so far has created ""high expectations,"" Mr. Bezos says. ""Every investment we make won't pay off as strongly as they have historically.""

128,"Confidence In NZ Real Estate Mkt Reaches New High - ASB Bk

 
 

  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Confidence in New Zealand's real estate market has climbed to a record high in the three months ended Jan. 31, according to a survey by ASB Bank. 

  The ASB housing confidence indicator showed a net 71% of respondents think it is a good time to buy a house, up from 52% with that view in the previous quarter ended Oct. 31. It is the highest level for the indicator in its three-year history. 

  ASB economist Rozanna Wozniak said mortgage interest rates have fallen to 30-year lows, and that has encouraged both confidence and activity in the real estate market. Three-quarters of those who think it is a good time to buy a house said low interest rates were the main reason for their view. 

  House prices rose 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 1998 after falling 5.4% over the preceding three quarters. Respondents to the ASB survey are more optimistic that prices will continue to rise, with 22% expecting increases in the next year, up from 2% from the previous survey. 

  However, Wozniak said, rises won't be significant. She said there are signs from the survey results that economic and financial uncertainty continue to be constraints on demand. Also, mortgage rates will start to rise, she said, though only from the second half of 1999. 

  She said the global economy remains the main factor that has the potential to stall the recovery in the economy and the real estate market, while the national election, which must be held by November this year, is a secondary risk. 

  Other factors slowing the house price advance are: the steady supply of new dwellings, as the trend in dwelling consents improves; the net outflow of migrants; and a likely reluctance of consumers to add to already high debt levels, she added.

  BOGOTA (AP)--Colombia's economy failed to grow last year in its worst performance since 1931, an association of banks and financial institutions said Sunday. 

  ""No growth, as has been calculated for last year, represents a true economic and social disaster,"" the National Association of Financial Institutions said in its weekly analysis of the economy. 

  If confirmed by official figures not yet released, it would be the first time the economy has failed to grow since 1931, when it shrank 1.6%, the association said. 

  Government officials had predicted 2% growth for 1998, but the economy nose-dived during the last few months. Economists blame high interest rates, new taxes, guerrilla violence and low oil prices in the oil-producing South American country. 

  The government predicts 1% growth this year, but Armando Montenegro, head of the association, said zero growth is likely again. 

  Unemployment that soared to 15.2% last October is provoking unrest among workers, who have called for a national protest Thursday against government austerity and privatization measures they blame for layoffs at government and state-owned companies.

130,"Australia Data -3: Foreign Debt To Grow In 1999

 
 

  Grace says most of the deterioration in the current account deficit so far has come through weaker export growth on falling commodity prices and global demand for Australian exports. 

  In terms of gross domestic product, the current account deficit stood at 4.7% of GDP in the third quarter. However, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane predicted that the current-account deficit will widen to about 5.5% of GDP in the fiscal year ending June 30, and may touch 6.0% of GDP, driven by lower prices for commodities, which make up around 60% of Australian exports. 

  Peters expects the current account deficit to average around 6% of GDP during 1999 ""because we still have commodity prices looking very weak so that our terms of trade will probably deteriorate over the year."" Falling world demand for Australian exports, against a domestic economy still demanding imports, will also push the deficit wider, he said. 

  That will only add to the nation's foreign debt, Peters added. 

  However, a stronger Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar in the first two months of 1999 ""will help"" contain rising import costs and foreign debt, Peters said. 

  The final piece of data due Tuesday is the net export contribution to GDP in the fourth quarter. Analysts expect on average that net exports made a 0.2 percentage point contribution to GDP, after a 0.2 percentage point contribution in the third quarter. Forecasts range from no contribution to a 0.9 percentage point contribution.

131,"WSJ OpEd: The Global Crisis of Corporatism

 
 

  By Edmund S. Phelps 

  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Thursday's Wall Street Journal. Mr. Phelps is a professor of economics at Columbia University). 

 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Meeting last month in Bonn, finance ministers of the Group of Seven countries discussed ways in which greater regulation of international financial flows could ease the plight of nations hard hit by the global economic turmoil. There's a better way to help: Induce the nations in crisis to reform their economies on the capitalist model, drop government involvement in the direction of ""development"" and establish acceptable standards of information reporting. Such steps would ensure that in the future these nations are less of a danger to themselves and others in the global economy. 

  The G-7's approach and the one I suggest reflect the opposing perspectives of the world's two main surviving economic systems: capitalism, in which every would-be entrepreneur is free to enter the market and compete without favoritism, and corporatism, in which private corporate interests are reconciled and coordinated by the central government. The first is pluralistic, open; the other is cooperative, run by insiders, Today, several economies in East Asia are informally corporatist, Russia and China seem increasingly so, and parts of Europe and Latin America have not wholly shed their corporatist ways. 

  Corporatist leaders have attempted to deflect attention from the recent malfunction of their system by blaming capitalism and calling for its restraint. They impute the series of crises to the system's financial center, which, they say, directs huge movements of capital in and out of the periphery -- Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America -- at the drop of a hat. A few Western economists and financiers seem to agree, as do Europe's center-left politicians. 

  But attributing the sharp moves in financial flows to the erratic ""push"" of capital from the center doesn't fit the facts. The push thesis fails to explain why in the 1990s huge capital flows went into east Asia while little went to Latin America and nothing to Africa. The thesis also leaves unexplained why within east Asia the more corporatist economies -- South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia -- were the big takers. (Noncorporatist Taiwan and the Philippines experienced more modest inflows and suffered only from the ensuing financial contagion.) 

  A better explanation for the crisis is the ""pull"" thesis. According to this view, the crisis had its roots in the big domestic firms' rosy expectations about the future returns on their investments and the future interest rates on their loans -- expectations that would not materialize if everyone acted on them at once. Similarly, domestic banks had unrealistic expectations about the capacity of the government to make good its implicit guarantee on loans that went bad. What followed was domestic asset-price inflation, particularly in the prices of nontradable capital goods, which drove the production of those goods above its equilibrium path -- and the economy's total employment above its equilibrium path. 

  Once these expectations came to be seen as unrealizable, the bubble of inflated asset prices burst. Prices had to drop at least to the path that would have prevailed had the bubble never gotten started -- and employment had to fall similarly. However, the boom created structural imbalances that forced asset prices to sink far below where they were when the bubble began -- and this reversal in turn drove employment into a structural slump. The typical corporatist economy had overinvested in export capacity, thus depressing export prices. It had also invested unwisely, picking too many losers. Its workers, richer from the extra earnings of the boom, would not accept prebubble wage rates absent a slump. Its banks became paralyzed by the overhang of bad loans. And the government's incompetence cost it the confidence of investors, 

  To be sure, capitalist economies, like corporatist ones, can lose their equilibrium -- witness the American bubble of the 1920s. It is in the nature of capitalism that rational lenders and shareholders take chances on less than complete information; they know they cannot tap into an entrepreneur's private knowledge and intentions. It is in the nature of corporatism, though, to get into a large and protracted disequilibrium, resulting in larger and larger structural imbalances. 

  First, the corporatists shielded their bubble from second opinions by denying lenders and share buyers access to extensive and timely information. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer told The Wall Street Journal Americas conference last fall that he had talked to Western bankers who clearly knew nothing about some of the Asian countries in which they were lending. If the actual situation had not been so obscure, new lenders would have been far more cautious, and old loans would have been called in sooner. 

  Second, the corporatist economy is disequilibrium -- prone because it steers capital to industries and firms viewed as prospective winners -- while capitalists bet on diverse and even incompatible visions. And since there are limits to how much economic knowledge the government can muster in making its choices, it tends to narrow the scope of development to a small number of industries. It was characteristic of the booms in the corporatist economies that they were concentrated in real estate, chemicals, steel, cars, microchips and a few other sectors. I suspect that the upward pressure on wage rates as workers became more comfortable over the years also played a part. To keep prosperity going in the face of rising labor costs, the corporatists fueled an investment boom to stimulate the demand for labor. 

  If this is the main story behind the recent turmoil, it constitutes a crisis of corporatism, not a crisis of capitalism. That seems to be the lesson drawn by Singapore, which has said it is opening its doors to more foreign investment and loosening restrictions to attract more overseas firms to locate there. And this suggests that the G-7's concern over financial flows is misplaced. It is national governments, not financial flows, that ought to be monitored, to check that they have reformed themselves along capitalist lines and are enforcing acceptable rules of conduct in their economies. 

  Students look shocked when told advanced capitalist countries have a right to demand of another country that it reform itself in their image. Yet in our business with other parties we demand they behave in a certain way if they want us to be their customer or employee or lender. And, not uncommonly, good guys gang up to require everyone else to meet their standards in order to obtain the general good. 

  Another reform is to start a private agency to gather information of interest to lenders and investors on emerging markets and disseminate it to subscribing Western banks and investment funds. So far neither the International Monetary Fund nor the private credit-rating agencies can be counted on to do this, as they maintain close ties to foreign corporatist governments. Yet the importance -- and the influence -- of such an agency cannot be understated. A large bank would be uncomfortable not subscribing, as it would be a conspicuous failure to exercise diligence in its lending. And an emerging-market economy would think twice about refusing to provide information, since doing so would risk a pullout by Western lenders and investors. 

  What the emerging-market nations need now is more capitalism, not less. The West will be right to demand that the so-called emerging market nations adopt the capitalist model for their own benefit and that of all members of the global economy.

  However, Treasurys were lifted off their lows later in the session as skittish investors left nothing to chance, and covered short positions ahead of the National Association of Purchasing Management report Thursday and a payrolls report scheduled for Friday.

133,"Ecuador Tries To End Populist Past As Economy Tumbles

 
 

  QUITO, Ecuador (AP)--Ecuador's penchant for eccentric presidents, circus-like politics and populist economics has backfired, and the tiny Andean nation must now pay the price, experts say. 

  In an effort to ease Ecuador's worst economic crisis in decades and soothe fears of a financial meltdown, President Jamil Mahuad announced a package of harsh austerity measures on Thursday that have enraged leftist-led unions. 

  Mahuad, who took office seven months ago, ordered the banks temporarily closed to prevent massive withdrawals, froze many dollar checking accounts for one year, doubled the price of gasoline, proposed prison for tax evaders and promised to accelerate privatizations and slash the bloated bureaucracy. 

  Earlier, he had ended fuel subsidies and frozen public sector wages. 

  Unions, students and Indian groups have called the measures a ""bullet in the head"" for Ecuadoreans. Vowing to topple Mahuad, they are calling for street protests and bank occupations on Wednesday. Business leaders are furious at having their dollar accounts frozen. 

  But so far, most Ecuadoreans -already among the poorest in Latin America- remain stunned. Violent protests have been limited. 

  With banks scheduled to reopen Monday after being closed for a week, people are anxious to see what the financial future holds. 

  ""I pray this signals a turn away from populism and easy solutions,"" Ecuadorean economist Jose Samaniego said. ""Because what we were doing before was the road to self-destruction."" 

  Past presidents have shamelessly doled out political patronage and cut deals with parties in Congress in order to pass laws, repeatedly approving deficit budgets and rejecting necessary but unpopular measures. 

  From small shopkeepers to factory owners, few in Ecuador pay taxes and no president had been willing to crack down on evaders. The government estimates that 80 percent of taxes are not paid. 

  As a result, Ecuador's budget deficit has ballooned to $1.2 billion and its national debt stands at $16 billion. 

  ""The roots of Ecuador's crisis are political,"" said former Vice President Blasco Penaherrera. ""For more than 20 years, with only a few very brief respites, we have not had serious government."" 

   Banana And Oil Export Revenues Collapse 

  While many of its Latin American neighbors privatized their state industries and opened markets to competition years ago, Ecuador has lagged behind, its economy propped up by oil and banana exports. 

  As long as its leaders could spread oil and banana money to the military and political elites, no president dared buck the system, Penaherrera said. 

  But when El Nino-driven floods devastated banana production last year and world oil prices fell, Ecuador entered what Mahuad called its ""worst economic crisis in 70 years."" 

  With the patronage system disrupted, economists say Mahuad, a political centrist with a master's degree in public administration from Harvard, has a unique opportunity to create a modern, free-market state. 

  But experts fear politics may doom the effort. 

  Many key reforms must be approved by Congress, which can veto presidential legislation. Mahuad's party lacks a majority and the main parties have announced their opposition to the austerity measures. 

  ""Mahuad doesn't have the support he needs in Congress to pass the reforms. I doubt that he can do it,"" Penaherrera said. 

  Among his supporters, there are growing calls for Mahuad to bypass the discredited Congress and rule by decree. 

  Since few presidents have held a majority in Congress, they have been forced to make deals with factions within the legislature to be able to govern. 

  ""For years, Congress has prevented effective government and blocked Ecuador's development,"" Penaherrera said. 

  Congressmen have engaged in fistfights, hurled glass ashtrays and even threatened to urinate on each other during sessions. 

  ""We've had the worst politicians in the world,"" said 24-year-old newspaper vendor Aldo Guzman.

134,"Nymex Close: Calif. Gasoline Surge Boosts Oil Complex

 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A desperate gasoline supply picture on the U.S. West Coast popped gasoline futures higher at the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, as East Coast traders worried about gasoline supply heading away from them and to the California market. 

  California Air Resources Board, or CARB, gasoline prices have shot up 45 cents a gallon to 80 cents in Los Angeles in the month since the closure of Tosco Corp.'s Avon refinery. Also in that time, Exxon Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. shut down fluid catalytic crackers, which produce gasoline, in Benicia and Carson, Calif. 

  Brokers in the San Francisco Bay Area, where prices traded around 90 cents a gallon Monday, said the region is virtually without supply. 

  April gasoline futures on Nymex settled 178 points higher at 49.42 cents a gallon, after hitting a high of 49.50 cents. April heating oil futures ended 170 points up at 42.39 cents a gallon. April oil, which expired at the end of the session, climbed 26 cents to $15.50 a barrel, while May ended 38 cents higher at $15.74. 

  Supply problems on the West Coast don't typically affect gasoline prices in the New York Harbor, which underlie Nymex gasoline futures. But such an extreme supply pinch coupled with indications that overall U.S. gasoline demand is rising had traders edgy. 

  ""There's some fear in the market that we'll see gasoline heading to the West Coast as gasoline demand strengthens on the East Coast,"" said Jason Chartrand, an energy analyst with GSC Energy in Atlanta. 

  In the week ended March 12, gasoline demand was a strong 8.8 million barrels a day, according to the American Petroleum Institute, at a time of year when gasoline demand is usually soft. At the same time, U.S. gasoline supply fell nearly 7 million barrels to 226.219 million barrels. 

  The refinery closures also had a bullish effect on diesel fuel prices, which sparked buying in heating oil futures. Diesel fuel and heating oil are distillates, and can have an effect on each other, a trader said. 

  Some analysts were skeptical of problems in California affecting the Nymex. And some warned that the market may rethink the gasoline run-up on Tuesday. 

  Surprisingly, the excitement in the products pits occurred on a day when OPEC and production cuts were supposed to be the focus of attention. But little earth-shattering news came from Vienna, where OPEC ministers are gathering ahead of Tuesday's full ministerial meeting, which should see ratification of an output cut of over 2 million barrels a day. 

  OPEC president and Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said Monday that total cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will exceed 2.1 million barrels a day. That figure is in line with what most analysts are expecting. 

  Most analysts think the cut agreement has been factored into prices, and the market could be set for a correction once the final headline from Vienna is written. ""That'll be a big unknown out of the way, and we can then get back to reality,"" one said. 

  But, the situation in California is likely to be considered in any sell-off this week. 

  The market shrugged off news Sunday that oil flow had stopped on Iraq-Turkey pipeline due to an explosion on a Turkish part of the line. Monday, the U.N. said oil resumed flowing on the line 

  The incident may have been an act of sabotage by the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, an autonomy-seeking terrorist organization that has attacked sites within Turkey, but officials wouldn't comment on the source of the explosion.

135,"FX Asia: High Oil Price Impact On Exchange Rates Downplayed

 
 
     By Tom Holland 
 

  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Far from being the disaster for Asia that some market players imagine it to be, this month's 27% rise in the price of oil will have no more than a small impact on Asian economies and currencies. 

  As officials and ministers from oil producing countries meet in Vienna on Tuesday to ratify an agreement to cut production by over 2 million barrels a day, some foreign exchange traders in Asia are citing the pact as reason to buy U.S. dollars against Asian currencies, particularly the yen. 

  But although the foreign exchange market may respond to the production cut with its customary kneejerk reaction, according to economists at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, there is little fundamental reason why a higher oil price should translate into a weaker yen. 

  ""The notion that Japan is a huge oil importer is an outdated idea,"" declares Robert Feldman, Morgan Stanley's chief economist in Tokyo. 

  Since 1982, when crude oil imports made up 38% of Japan's total imports, the importance of oil to the Japanese economy has fallen drastically. Today, says Feldman, crude oil accounts for just 8% of Japan's imports, eclipsed by alternative energy sources including nuclear power and liquid natural gas. 

  And although at its current price of $15.50 per barrel, the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate blend is up a massive 50% from its 12 year low of $10.35 hit in December, the price has merely regained levels last seen in October. 

 
   Yen Price Of Oil Down By 3% 
 

  Overall, in U.S. dollar terms, the price is just 18% above last year's average. In yen terms, however, the price of the oil imported by Japan has actually fallen. Because of the rise in the value of the Japanese currency in the third quarter of last year, from a Japanese perspective, the oil price has dropped by around 3% from last year's average, argues Feldman. 

  With Japanese oil imports worth around Y3 trillion in 1998, a 3% fall in the oil price represents a saving of about Y90 billion. Put into the context of Japan's Y500 trillion gross domestic product, the impact is negligible. 

  ""In short, there is no effect,"" says Feldman. 

  The impact on other Asian countries and currencies is also likely to be subdued, says Morgan Stanley. 

  According to Tim Condon, the firm's Hong Kong-based Southeast Asian economist, Malaysia and Indonesia, as net oil exporters, will benefit from any sustained rise in the oil price. 

  Each country will see its current account move further into surplus and there will a small boost to GDP in 1999. GDP shrinkage in Indonesia will be limited to around 3.6% compared with previous estimates of 4.0%. Malaysia will grow by around 2.0%, compared with 1.8% in the absence of the oil price rise. 

  Among other regional countries, Singapore, with a roughly balanced oil account, will see little or no net effect. Korea and the Philippines, as oil importers, will see some contraction of their trade surpluses, and slightly slower growth than would have been expected otherwise. 

  Most at risk from any extended oil price rise would be India, which already a running a sizable $15 billion trade deficit. 

  ""The extent to which currencies are vulnerable to external shocks such as higher oil prices depends on the size of their current account surpluses or deficits and the extent of over or under-valuation of currencies,"" wrote Condon in a research paper published on March 16. 

  ""The Indian rupee may be vulnerable to pressure from a wider current account deficit. But for the rest of the region, the small narrowing of trade surpluses would be unlikely to result in serious pressure on their currencies.""

136,"Ecuador Wins Preliminary Agreement For $900M Loan Package

 

  By Michael M. Phillips 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Cash-strapped Ecuador secured preliminary agreement Friday on a $900 million international loan package to help it escape a severe economic and financial crisis. 

  The deal will include $500 million from the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and Andean Development Corp. (ADCC) to help the government restructure or close troubled banks. The International Monetary Fund committed to provide its own large 18-month loan, worth an estimated $400 million. 

  In addition, the development banks plan to disburse $500 million this year for ongoing projects in Ecuador, bringing the total flow of aid to $1.4 billion. 

  The heads of the IMF, IDB and World Bank joined Finance Minister Ana Lucia in a display of support obviously intended to calm financial markets and generate political support for reform in Ecuador. 

  ""We applaud and admire the government's efforts,"" IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told reporters. 

  The small oil-producing country has been hit by a combination of low oil prices, international and domestic financial turmoil, and political stalemate. President Jamil Mahuad's austerity campaign has generated intense opposition from the legislature, as well as upheaval in the streets. 

  Key to winning IMF support was the fact that the government finally convinced Congress this month to adopt tax increases and spending cuts expected to slash the budget deficit this year to about 4% of Gross Domestic Product from about 8%. In addition, international auditors will begin work Monday trying to assess which of the country's 36 banks should be restructured or closed, a process likely to cost billions of dollars. 

  Stanley Fischer, the IMF's No. 2, is traveling to Quito next week to discuss the need for reforms, and the IMF expects to formalize an agreement by the end of May. With IMF board approval expected in June, Ecuador will be able to meet July 5 with the Paris Club of creditor governments to seek restructuring of some $800 million in debt. 

  Minister Armijos described Friday's announcement as a ""show of the international community's immense support for Ecuador's progress.""

137,"Mexico/Pemex/March -2: Nat Gas Prod 4.768 BCF/D

 
 

  MEXICO CITY (Dow Jones)--Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos (E.PEM) exported an average of 1.64 million barrels a day of crude oil in March at an average price of $10.79 a barrel. 

  According to statistics released Monday, Pemex crude output in March totaled 3.05 million b/d, up from 3.02 million b/d in February. 

  Heavy Maya crude output averaged 1.659 million b/d, while light Isthmus output averaged 846,000 b/d and super light Olmeca production averaged 548,000 b/d. 

  Of March crude exports, 1.417 million b/d went to the Americas, 121,000 b/d went to Europe and 59,000 b/d went to Asia and other regions. 

  Exports of Maya crude averaged 1.021 million b/d, exports of Isthmus averaged 169,000 b/d and exports of Olmeca averaged 450,000 b/d. 

  Pemex said its natural gas production in March averaged 4.768 billion cubic feet a day, down from 4.787 Bcf/d in February. 

  The $10.79-per-barrel average crude price for March is the highest monthly average price since September 1998. Mexico's crude oil exports averaged $8.68 per barrel in January and 48.26 per barrel in February. 

  Oil prices have risen following a March agreement by global producers to reduce output by around 2.1 million b/d.

138,"NZ Economists/Prices -2: Food Prices Affected By Climate

 
 

  The divergence between the 0.1% fall in the CPIX in the last quarter of 1998 and the expected 0.4% rise in the latest quarter was driven to a large extent by one-time factors which pose no monetary policy significance, economists said. 

  ""A lot of the latest rise in prices was due to food, which was drought-related,"" said Robin Clements, Chief Economist at Warburg Dillon Read (NZ) Ltd. 

  The food price index rose 0.8% in January and 1.1% in February. Food makes up around 18% of the total CPIX index. 

  The summer drought in some regions contributed to a significant rise in vegetable and food prices in early 1999, economists said, while hikes in tobacco and alcohol retail prices were related to adjustments to government taxes. 

  The start of the academic year, in which technical institute and university fees rose, also pushed up the general level of prices within the recreation and education subgroup of the CPIX, economists said. 

  Economists agree prices within the housing sector partially recovered after falling a dramatic 0.8% in the last three months of 1998. But views vary on the extent to which a strengthening construction market will have been accurately reflected in first quarter data. 

  ANZ Banking Group (NZ) Ltd. Treasury Economist David Drage said he estimates that prices in the housing group rose 0.6% in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. 

  Other economists, however, said they expect prices in the housing group were closer to flat in the latest quarter. 

  Merrill Lynch NZ Ltd. Economist Mark Benseman said central bank officials will be monitoring recent statements by electricity retail companies and local government agencies, indicating their charges will soon rise. 

  Yet, it is unclear at this stage how significant to the general level of prices such individual sector movements will prove to be, he said.

139,"U.S. Retail Gasoline Prices Up In East, Dn In West-Lundberg

 
 

  CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP)--Gasoline prices rose slightly nationwide over the past two weeks, though prices declined somewhat in the West, an industry analyst said. 

  Crude oil price hikes forced pump prices up about 2 cents per gallon in states along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, while prices dropped about 1.5 cents in the West and Midwest, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 

  The national weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was $1.2296 per gallon Friday, a 0.15 cent rise from two weeks earlier, analyst Trilby Lundberg said. 

  'Behind that apparent lack of activity there, a lot has been going on,' Ms. Lundberg said. 'There have been price increases in Eastern and Gulf Coast states, which washed out the price cuts.' 

  Explosions and problems in several California refineries caused prices to skyrocket in that state in recent weeks. However, increased supplies of gasoline have helped stabilize the market to knock down prices in the West, she said. 

  'The capacity is not all the way up to what it was, but as the situation normalizes in California, prices in the West will continue to topple,' said Ms. Lundberg. 

  The average prices at self-service stations was $1.1733 per gallon for regular gasoline, $1.2748 for mid-grade and $1.3598 for premium. 

  Full-service prices were $1.5304 for regular, $1.6173 for mid-grade and $1.6905 for premium.

140,"Ecuador Econ Crisis Won&apos;t End Anytime Soon - U.S. Analysts

 
 

  By Enza Tedesco 

 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--With Ecuador mired in its worst economic crisis in seven decades, observers are asking themselves whether things can get any worse. 

  The answer is yes, according to several U.S.-based analysts. While Ecuador's government is forecasting economic growth of between 1.5% and 2.0% this year, economists are predicting a contraction of between 2% and 10%. Inflation projections range from 40% to 170%, against the government's estimate of 36%. 

  With gross domestic product expanding a minuscule 0.8% last year as it battled the weather phenomenon El Nino and low commodities prices, analysts say the tiny Andean country is just setting out to solve its fiscal and economic problems. 

  This year a chaotic currency devaluation, a one-week closure of banks, the freezing of almost half of all bank deposits, nationwide strikes and increasing political squabbles between the government and opposition parties have fueled an ongoing deterioration. 

  Vowing to halve the country's ballooning fiscal deficit to 3.5% of GDP, President Jamil Mahuad last Friday forwarded to Congress a raft of tax and cost-cutting measures that lawmakers are expected to start debating next week. That's not enough, according to many economists. 

  ""Even if the package is approved by Congress, we believe the 1999 deficit will again overshoot by a significant margin as a result of unplanned currency weakness and a sharp contraction of the economy,"" says Graham Stock, vice president of international fixed-income research at Chase Securities Inc., which is forecasting a 10% GDP contraction. 

  Many see the pending measures in Congress as only offering short-term economic relief, with the government needing to attack fundamental problems to create medium and long-term stability. 

  ""Currently, Ecuador has a credibility problem,"" says Ramon Aracena, senior Latin American economist at the Institute of International Finance, or IIF, which represents many of the world's largest banks and investment funds. 

  ""Once credibility is restored, the pressure on the currency and interest rates will be alleviated,"" predicts Aracena, who expects GDP to contract 2%, on the optimistic end of economists' forecasts. 

 
   Banks, Political Opposition Are Twin Challenges 
 

  Jose M. Barrionuevo, a global strategist at Lehman Brothers, says the government fiscal program could become the first baby step toward a slow economic recovery, but only ""if those reforms are approved with urgency by Congress and if combined with a decisive program of bank restructuring."" 

  Barrionuevo is forecasting a GDP contraction of 4% and inflation of 50% ""in the most conservative scenario, where the government manages to skip a deteriorating political dispute."" 

  According to Chase's Stock, the road to recovery turns tougher since some of the measures seem unrealistic. 

  ""Oil prices assumptions are all right today, but they're not guaranteed to stay as high; while the assumed funding from debt renegotiations don't seem viable,"" he says. 

  But investors' immediate concerns surround the banking sector's frailty, highlighted by this month's collapse of the second-largest bank - Banco del Progreso - and the political gridlock that is sapping any residual support for Mahuad's administration, which assumed power last August. 

  ""Banks are in an extremely delicate situation,"" says IIF's Aracena. ""They need some sort of chemotherapy to cure their health and that will take years. But the important thing is for them to start the treatment."" 

  Bruised by continuous pressure on the local currency, the government on Feb. 12 decided to abandon the sucre's trading band and let it float freely. While that helped staunch the bleeding of reserves, it prompted a run on bank deposits and introduced extraordinary volatility in the foreign exchange market - most of it downward. 

  The sucre closed Wednesday at a mid rate of 10,250 per dollar, after plunging as far as ECS17,000 in intraday trading March 5 - a 74% depreciation from the end of 1998. U.S. analysts predict the exchange rate will average between ECS10,500/dollar and ECS14,000/dollar in 1999, against a government projection of ECS7,460 before the devaluation. 

  After shooting up to 180% earlier this year, interest rates have fallen since the sucre's devaluation - but were still at 94% Wednesday, keeping pressure on the banking sector. 

  On the legislative front, tax reforms and new laws that will help the administration streamline the public sector and reduce public spending are vigorously opposed by the Social Christians, the country's main opposition party. 

  ""The main barriers to sound fiscal policy in Ecuador are the relationship between the executive and Congress, and the difficult process for decision-making in Congress due to the large number of parties, each with its own agenda,"" says Santiago Millan, Latin American analyst at New York-based research firm I.D.E.A.. Millan expects the Ecuadorean economy to shrink by 5% in 1999. 

 
   IMF Aid No Sure Thing; Debt Default Not Ruled Out 
 

  Earlier in March the government seemed to have reached a pact with opposition parties to scale back gasoline price hikes in return for opposition support of new tax measures. But after two parties threatened to pull out of the accord unless the government cut fuel prices further, the executive has beeen scrambling to build a new alliance. 

  ""The subsequent delays in turning to economic matters, presumably in the search of a consensus, that never emerged, mean that the fiscal position is worse than ever, and the ongoing recession has reduced tolerance for economic discipline,"" says Chase's Stock. 

  Under these circumstances, economists say it's hard to envision a prompt agreement with the International Monetary Fund. An IMF mission has been in Ecuador for several weeks in an effort to hammer out an 18-month, $400-million standby credit facility. 

  ""Over the next few months we expect to hear words of encouragement from the Fund for the banking sector reform and fiscal adjustment, but proper negotiations look unlikely before the second half of the year at the earliest,"" says Stock. 

  A delay in reaching a deal with the IMF would translate into a similar delay in negotiations with the Paris Club, as Ecuador seeks to refinance about $400 million in capital and interest arrears from $1.3 billion in bilateral debt. The country's external debt totals $15.245 billion and its service equals about 41% of the budget. 

  ""The country's debt burden takes up considerable space in the budget...this is obviously the unfortunate result of an inefficient process of fiscal policy that through the years led to a large accumulation of foreign debt,"" says I.D.E.A.'s Millan. 

  Millan pegs Ecuador's current external debt to GDP ratio at 75.3%, more than double the Latin American average of 35%. 

  Faced with a bloated deficit and growing popular discontent, analysts don't rule out the possibility that either this administration or any successor might default on sovereign debt. 

  ""One day the finance ministry will be faced with a tough choice between missing another month's salary for nurses and teachers or skipping a coupon payment to foreign investors,"" says Chase's Stock. ""It's a choice I wouldn't want to make, but I think the sympathies of most Ecuadoreans will be very clear.""

142,"Australia Curr Acct Deficit Seen At Over 6% Of GDP

 
 

  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australia's first-quarter current account deficit has probably widened to over 6% of first-quarter gross domestic product, and it doesn't look like it will improve much in the second quarter, analysts say. 

  Analysts on average expect the first-quarter current account - due out at 0130 GMT Tuesday - to grow to A$9.10 billion from A$7.97 in the fourth quarter of 1998, which was the largest quarterly deficit on record. Forecasts range between A$8.90 billion and A$9.60 billion. 

  Retail data for April is also due out Tuesday, and analysts on average expect a 1.5% fall in this sector after a 2.3% rise in March sales. Expectations range from a 3.5% fall in sales to a flat outcome. 

  A deficit of A$9.10 billion would take the current account deficit to over 6% of first-quarter GDP, which have come under pressure by lower prices on commodites, making up around 60% of Australian exports, analysts say. 

  Australia's current account deficit averaged 4.1% of GDP in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. 

  Ian Macfarlane, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, recently said the widening in the current account deficit is ""more a reflection of the strength of the Australian economy, rather than its weakness."" 

  The deficit is widening because of ""differing growth rates between the Australian economy and its trading partners,"" Macfarlane said. Australia's economy grew 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 1998, or 4.7% of GDP year-on-year. First-quarter GDP data are due out June 2. 

  Given external reasons for the country's large current account deficit, Richard Yetsenga, senior economist with Deutsche Bank in Australia, doesn't expect investors to run away from Australian investments, though the Australian dollar ""might wobble a little bit"" on Tuesday's data. He expects the current account deficit widened to A$9.1 billion in the first quarter.

  Industrial output growth also slowed to 7.6% from 10.3% in 1997, the central bank report said. Building materials, wheat flour, milk products and other related factory products showed improved growth, it added. 

  Agriculture sector growth also slowed down somewhat, falling to 2.5% in 1998 from 3.0% the year before. High yields on rice paddies helped contain a negative effect from other sectors. 

  The report said tea prices, which form nearly 5% of GDP in total export earnings, failed to maintain early momentum and rose by a modest 17% in 1998. 

  The slide in tea prices was triggered by Russia's currency turmoil in August and an oversupply in world markets, the report said. 

  Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States account for about 30% of direct and indirect imports of Sri Lankan tea. Since the ruble crisis, though, that share has slipped to around 25%. 

  The island nation's external trade also suffered in the period under review, thereby affecting overall economic performance. Exports grew by just 2.0% last year, much lower than the 13% registered the year before, the report said. 

  The report highlighted the difficulties faced by rubber and coconut manufacturers due to the currency depreciations in East Asia. For instance, rubber output declined by 21% in the period under review. The gem and diamond industry posted declines in nominal income of around 5%, the report said.

145,"Australian Salaries Seen Gaining 3.5%-4.25% This Year

 
 

  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australian workers are likely to receive a salary increase of between 3.5% and 4.25% in 1999, according to a survey issued Monday by the Australian Institute of Management. 

  That is down slightly on actual salary increases in 1998 of between 3.8% and 5.4%, according to the survey. 

  If proved correct, such increases are well above Australia's inflation rate, which stood at an underlying rate of 1.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier. 

  On an industry-by-industry basis, the largest salary increases are likely in the electronic and information technology sector and the business and professional services sector, where average increases of 4.8% are expected, according to the survey results. 

  The biggest change in salary increases by industry is expected in the banking, finance and insurance sector, where salaries are forecast to rise by 3.5% in 1999, down from average increases of 5.5% in 1998. 

  Organizations responding to the survey said the most likely common reason for a salary increase during 1999 will be individual performance, followed by increases based on inflation and adjusting salaries for changes in labor market rates.

146,"AWSJ: Indonesia&apos;s Election Restores Faith Of Investors

 
  By Jay Solomon 
  Staff Reporter 

  JAKARTA -- Investors are registering a major vote of confidence in Indonesia's freest election in nearly a half century. 

  The stock market rose 12% Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund approved $450 million in aid, and local businessmen talked optimistically of restructuring debt-laden companies in a more-stable political environment. 

  ""Political stability is the only chance for companies to survive, and the first major hurdle was cleared"" in Monday's parliamentary election, said Indra Widjaja, president-director of PT Bank Internasional Indonesia, one of the largest private banks in the nation. ""Interest rates and the currency should stabilize as political risk subsides."" 

  Business investments in Indonesia have largely been put on hold in the months heading into the parliamentary vote. The rioting that swept the country last year - and forced former President Suharto's resignation - remained fresh in people's minds, and the assumption was that politics, combined with simmering ethnic and religious tensions, would set off another round of unrest during the campaign. Foreign-investment approvals plunged nearly 90% in the first 10 weeks of 1999, compared with the year earlier. 

  But the euphoric three-week campaign period ended up looking more like a rock concert than a war zone - large-scale unrest never materialized. Monday's voting was calm and orderly. 

  Financial markets responded. Jakarta's key stock index rose 12% Tuesday to a 22-month high, while the nation's currency, the rupiah, has strengthened 5.6% since Friday, trading late Tuesday in Asia at 7,660 rupiah to the dollar. Traders said the market gains were fueled by ""panic buying"" driven by a perception that the political risks long associated with Indonesia were abating. 

  ""It's all about country risk in Indonesia, and with the election over this risk subsides,"" said the Singapore-based trading chief at a U.S. brokerage house. ""People are not overly concerned about who's in charge of the country - only that it's stable."" 

  The IMF also placed its stamp of approval on the election by endorsing the $450 million loan late Monday in the U.S. While the fund never explicitly said it was withholding loans to Indonesia until after the election - as the World Bank did - it did delay a meeting that could have seen the funds disbursed earlier. Many observers saw this as the IMF pressing President B.J. Habibie's government for a free and fair vote. 

  Stanley Fischer, the first deputy managing director at the IMF, voiced optimism Monday in Washington over Indonesia's prospects for economic recovery. ""With inflation falling and the exchange rate stable, there is room to reduce interest rates further, thus improving prospects for recovery,"" Mr. Fischer said. The IMF official also said Indonesia's economic growth was likely to become positive by the end of the year, while inflation would fall to single digits. 

  But many financial analysts still are cautious about Indonesia. On the corporate side, they say that many Indonesian companies remain insolvent because of the combination of a weak rupiah and billions of dollars of debt. Although interest rates have been falling - one-month central-bank paper is now yielding 25%, down from 40% earlier in the year - it is still too expensive for most companies to raise financing. 

  The idea that Jakarta's main index, now at 687, is within striking distance of its precrisis high of 740, hit in July 1997, is a portent of an overcooked market, they warn. ""The prices can't hold from a fundamental point of view,"" said economist Neil Saker of SG Securities in Singapore. 

  Some observers warn that there could still be political tension ahead, despite the success of the actual vote. A fractious coalition government could emerge, making implementation of painful economic reforms all the more difficult. 

  But Indonesian businessmen still say the peaceful vote is significantly improving the investment climate. 

  Harun Hajadi, managing director of PT Ciputra, a major Indonesian property firm, said his attempts to restructure the company have been undercut by political risk over the past year. Foreign investors he courted balked because of perceived political and social risks; those who did consider projects demanded exorbitantly high returns. Sales of Ciputra's private homes fell 70% from precrisis levels, to 3,000 units last year, as soaring interest rates killed off consumer demand, Mr. Harun said. 

  But now he sees his business fortunes improving, mainly as a result of falling interest rates. ""The peacfulness of the election was a very significant event,"" he said. 

  Mr. Widjaja of Bank Internasional Indonesia, who is in the process of recapitalizing the bank, also said the calm will help him, too. Indonesian banks have been crushed by negative spreads - which means they pay borrowers higher rates than they earn from deposits. ""This situation should improve"" as a result of the vote, he said. 

  Perhaps most importantly, the peaceful votes could woo back Indonesia's ethnic-Chinese business class, whose shops and homes bore the brunt of much of last year's violence. Though the memories of last May's rioting remains fresh in their minds, and some continue to keep their families overseas for security reasons, many say they feel the security situation in the country is starting to improve. 

  ""During the past year I lost half of all I owned,"" said Richard Hakim, an ethnic Chinese businessman who owns the toiletries producer PT Kintamolek Masa. ""Things can only get better.""

147,"U.S. DOE Touts $1B USDA Loan Plan To Oil Patch

 
 
     By Campion Walsh 
 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Department of Energy is seeking to tap in a U.S. Department of Agriculture's $1 billion-a-year rural development loan program in order to help the country's distressed oil and gas producers. 

  Searching for ways to help small, independent domestic oil producers suffering from the 1998 plunge in crude oil prices, DOE officials discovered that Agriculture Department loan guarantees for rural business apply to oil and gas producers, said Peter Lagiovane of DOE's fossil energy division. 

  DOE began promoting the loan program at an April workshop with oil and gas producers in Oklahoma, Lagiovane said. It will discuss the program further at workshops planned in California in June or July, and in Texas in August, he said. 

  Since 1997, the Agriculture Department has had $1 billion in spending authority for the program, which aims to assist non-farm businesses in rural areas, encompassing regional populations of less than 50,000. 

  ""The oil industry hasn't been a big user of the loan program,"" said Dayton J. Watkins, administrator for Agriculture Department's rural business and cooperative division. 

  ""We're working at the staff level with the Department of Energy, trying to craft a relationship that's beneficial to (the oil and gas) industry,"" Watkins said. 

  Lagiovane said almost all of the smaller, independent oil and gas companies can apply for the loan guarantees because the program's rural requirements concern the location of a company's operations, and not its headquarters. 

 
    [New Funding Needed To Ensure Oil Sector Aid] 
 

  Since 1997, the Agriculture Department program has been fully subscribed, and oil companies would face stiff competition from other loan-hungry industries, Watkins said. 

  Given the difficult conditions in the petroleum sector over the past year, oil and gas companies may be able to show a particular need for assistance, but they'll also have to present reasonable credit risk, he said. 

  Earmarking funds for oil and gas producers would require new funding for the program from DOE or Congress, he said. 

  The program guarantees up to 80% of loans from private banks of up to $10 million per company. The average amount of loans has been about $1.5 million, and the default rate has been less than 3%. 

  Meanwhile, Sen. Pete Domenici's, R-N.M., plans to send a bill to the Senate floor later this month that would guarantee up to $500 million in emergency loans specifically for oil and gas producers. 

  On May 25, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved Domenici's bill, along with a similar bill sponsored by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to support the U.S. steel industry. 

  Domenici's bill, which was stripped from an emergency supplement spending bill passed last month, would allow oil and gas producers and oil-service companies to take loans of up to $10 million each with guarantees from the federal government. 

  Domenci's proposed emergency loan guarantee program would expire after five years, but loans could remain outstanding for a longer period. The program would cost the federal government $125 million in guarantees and $2.5 million in administrative costs, according to a draft of the bill. 

  The Agriculture Department's rural development program could cut down on administrative costs of Domenici's bill if it passes, according to Watkins. 

  The program has already helped to distribute assistance available to communities affected by military downsizing and the North American Free Trade Agreement, he said.

148,"WSJ(6/18):Column: Mexico&apos;s Telephone Monopoly Hang-Up

 
 

  By Mary Anastasia O'Grady 

  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Friday's Wall Street Journal. Ms. O'Grady edits the Americas column). 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--""...[T]here has not been significant pro-gress toward the policy goal of increasing the penetration rate to 20 [telephone] lines per 100 persons. As a result, Mexico is even further behind other countries than it was in 1990."" 

  - From a draft copy of ""Regulatory Reform in Mexico's Telecommunications Industry,"" Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, February 1999. 

  The final release of this 57-page OECD report is due out shortly. Unless it is dramatically altered for political correctness, it promises to be an enormous embarrassment to a government that purports to defend the public interest. The stock of Telmex, Mexico's telecom `monopoly', is roaring, but Mexicans - or at least the ones who have been able to obtain telephones - are choking on their bills. 

  While the OECD acknowledges that the country's 1995 telecommunications law is a good one, it finds that ""the regulatory authority has inadequate powers to regulate, particularly in regard to regulation of the incumbent in markets where it has substantial market power."" 

  Just why the regulator - known by the Spanish acronym Cofetel - has been unable to rein in Telmex and create a competitive market is a subject of much political debate. But the apolitical OECD draft report simply measures the results: Eight years after privatization, Mexican telephony consumers still suffer inordinately high cost structures and poor service, leaving them miserably behind their OECD counterparts. 

  When it comes to private monopolies, there is probably no better symbol in Mexico than giant Telmex. It is Mexico's second largest company and the largest on the Mexican Stock Exchange. When the company was privatized in 1990, the government granted it certain concessionary rights to attract investors. Although the market was officially opened to competition in 1997, Mexico's Competition Commission (CFC) said in March 1998 that Telmex continues to enjoy ""dominant status"" in five telecom markets. 

  One important problem the OECD report raises is the question of the regulator's political independence since its ""rights and obligations"" are delegated by the Ministry of Communications and Transportation. When pressed about the need to curtail Telmex's monopoly powers in October 1997, Minister Carlos Ruiz Sacristan said ""one has to be very careful not to negatively impact the stock market."" In December 1997 a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter research paper commented favorably on Telmex, noting ""we continue to see regulators acting in favor of the company's interest, which is a positive."" The OECD's report shows how this attitude, together with the ""inadequate statutory powers of Cofetel,"" has left Mexicans in the dark ages of telephony. 

  The report compares Mexico's telecommunications services to other OECD countries. One of the salient points is in the area of access: At the start of 1998, Mexico had less than 10 telephones per 100 inhabitants. Poland, the next worst performer among OECD countries, had 20. In Mexico no new access lines were added in 1996 and 1997. This is particularly scandalous given the fact that Cofetel argues, according to the OECD, that interconnection rates ""must be set above long-run incremental cost to encourage network expansion and universal service goals to be met."" In other words, Telmex was given the right to charge high access rates to competitors because it was to use the extra income to get more phones to more people. 

  A second problem for consumers is high prices. The report shows Mexican ""tariff baskets"" for both residential and business service towering over the rest of the OECD. Inflation, the authors note, distorts this picture. But this seems scant justification: According to the publication Telecommunications, local phone service prices, which are still controlled by Telmex, increased 63% in 1997, not a year of raging inflation. Moreover, the report says that following the macroeconomic crisis that began in 1994, Telmex ""appreciated in relative value given the decline in the value of the Mexican peso on international markets."" 

  In the February issue of the Inter-American Development Bank's magazine IDB America, Paul Constante compares telephone costs for a Mexican producer against those of a U.S. producer competing for business in London. For five calls of four minutes apiece the American pays $5.40 while the Mexican pays $25.20. The picture in local rates is even gloomier. 

  The report points out that Telmex, by concession, ""virtually owns all public networks and provides local and interconnection services."" It is control over these interconnection services that in practice allows Telmex to control prices. Yet in telecom deregulation, this is the drill, nothing unique to Mexico. The real difficulties, say some analysts, comes from the fact that Cofetel, the ministry and Telmex set the terms for the concession in secrecy. There is no public hearing, no public record and no cost transparency; as far as the public knows, the regulator accepts whatever ""costs"" Telmex declares. 

  Not only are cost claims cryptic but there has been no public accountability for the failures in network expansion. Says Philip Peters, Vice President of the Lexington Institute in Virginia and a telecom expert, ""Cofetel bought the idea that high interconnection charges are needed to cover Telmex's investments in phone network expansion, but the money all went to Telmex general revenues. There was no segregated fund, much less an accounting of expenditures."" 

  Some speculate that Telmex is protected because a drop in its share price would be bad for Mexican stability. This theory makes little sense. Policy makers have had ample time during the six-year presidency of Ernesto Zedillo to open up competition for the welfare of all citizens. And nothing would improve Mexico's stability more than productivity improvements derived from competition. 

  The CFC, to its credit, is pushing hard for competition. And Cofetel is now proposing to force Telmex to separate local and long distance pricing in order to end the practice of cross-subsidizing predatory pricing in competitive markets with revenues from local markets where there is almost no competition. Cofetel has also drafted rules that would force Telmex to share costs and data with rivals. 

  As if to demonstrate just how difficult that will be, Telmex sought and won an injunction last week against the CFC's ""dominant status"" ruling, which is the fulcrum of all Cofetel's reforms. Cofetel has promised to go back to court to argue that these reforms are in the national interest; if that can proven, the judge ruled, the decision can be reversed. 

  The legal wrangling is guaranteed to continue. But with a little political will the government can give Cofetel the power and independence it needs to help foster a competitive market. A good start would be requiring greater transparency in the regulatory process.

149,"Australia/Leading Index -3: Raising Rates In 1Q 2000

 
 

  Strong gains in the share market, coupled with a rise in the real money supply and the amount of overtime worked also contributed to the strength of the April index. 

  Growth in the leading index is 2.8 percentage points above trend, and ""is now even more clearly signaling that growth through 1999 and into 2000 will be well above long-term trend,"" said Westpac's general manager of economics, Bill Evans. 

  ""This evidence casts further doubt on the generally held view that the Australian economy will experience a significant slowdown in the second half of 1999 and into 2000,"" he said. 

  The coincident index was also buoyed by strong March quarter national accounts. ""Nonetheless, the strength of the coincident index appears to have attenuated over the past few months, which was predicted by the leading index earlier. 

  Weak labor market statistics are the ""major soft spot"" for the coincident index,"" Evans said. We expect that a near-term recovery in jobs growth, combined with continuing strong retail spending will underpin a strong coincident index in coming months."" 

  ""Overall, the leading index for Australia continues to signal that Australia's growth will be maintained at a very healthy pace, certainly much faster than predicted by both the government in their recent budget papers, and the Reserve Bank,"" he said. 

  Evans continued saying that ""while interest rates are currently on hold, particularly because the authorities are expecting the economy to cool later this year, we expect the continuing evidence of our robust economic growth will lead the Australian authorities to follow the U.S. by raising interest rates beginning in the first quarter of 2000."" 

  The leading index of inflation, which measures inflationary pressures in the economy, moderated to 4.9% in April.

150,"NZ Econ Grp Sees Domestic Recovery; Mixed Export Success

 
 

  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Rising domestic demand will underpin economic activity in New Zealand over the next year or so, but the country's export performance paints a mixed picture, a New Zealand economic research house said Monday. 

  In its Quarterly Predictions, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc. forecasts the expenditure-based measure of gross domestic product will rise by 2.9% in the year ending March 31, 2000, compared with the year ended March 31, 1999. 

  The economy is forecast then to grow by 3.6% in the year ending March 31, 2001, followed by annual average GDP growth of 4.0% in the following year to March 31, 2002, the NZIER said. 

  Domestic demand is continuing to carry the economy forward, aided by income-tax cuts last year and retail interest rates, which have so far in 1999 sat at, or close to, historically low levels, the NZIER said. 

  ""Growth in real expenditure GDP will lift from minus-0.8% in 1998-1999, to +2.9% in 1999-2000. The main factors behind this are a continuing growth in household consumption and a gradual recovery in exporting as the effects of the Asian crisis subside,"" the NZIER said in a commentary. 

  ""Our export situation is still very vulnerable, with some sectors yet to show convincing signs of an improvement. Our overall export performance has been very patchy so far in 1999, and it will remain patchy for some time yet,"" it said. 

 
    Tourism Has Recovered From Downturn In Asia 
 

  The NZIER said the tourism sector has been the ""star performer"" recently, recovering strongly from the downturn in Asian markets seen last year. 

  The fall in the value of the New Zealand dollar over the past 18 months or so has fueled strong growth in arrivals from Australia, the U.S. and the U.K., particularly for people arriving to do business, or visit friends or family. 

  The NZIER forecasts total arrivals will continue growing strongly, at a7.0% annualized rate, in the year ending March 31, 2000. 

 
   Manufacturing Sector Is A Cause For Concern 
 

  In contrast, the manufacturing sector appears to be experiencing a ""quiet crisis,"" with no growth in exports, and little sign of improvement on the horizon, the NZIER said. 

  Local manufacturers' key export market, Australia, has become an increasingly competitive market following last year's downturn in key Asian markets. 

  While the New Zealand dollar has eased, it hasn't eased by as much as many Asian currencies, meaning some competitors based in Asia have gained a greater exchange-rate-induced competitive advantage, the NZIER said. 

 
   Agricultural Exports Continue To Falter 
 

  The NZIER said agricultural exports remain weak, with lamb prices falling steadily and wool prices continuing to falter. 

  ""At the same time, the legacy of two years of drought will constrain production over the next few seasons. We are forecasting export volumes for meat products to continue falling over the next year. Dairy export volumes will rise, reflecting the recovery in Asia, but prices will remain under pressure. Overall, agricultural exports are in a difficult situation and won't recover quickly,"" the NZIER said.

151,"Australia Watch: Benign Inflation May Narrow Bond Spread

 
 
      By Nicki Bourlioufas 
 

  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Second quarter data to be released next week are expected to show that inflation pressures remained subdued in Australia, opening the way for a further narrowing in the spread of Australian bond yields relative to U.S. Treasurys. 

  Underlying inflation was running at 1.7% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. That would be unchanged from the first quarter rate, and within the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2% to 3% target band. 

  'That's still pretty modest inflation given that the economy is growing at plus-4%,' said Grant Fitzner, economist at HSBC Markets. 

  With inflation under control, and little prospect of a rate rise this year, Australian bonds ought to perform better relative to U.S. Treasurys, some analysts say. Though U.S. inflation also appears subdued, there's still some prospect the Federal Reserve will raise rates again in August. 

  'By the end of the month there should be a bit more of a focus on inflation and that should give the local bond market a bit more scope for outperformance,' says Su-Lin Ong, senior economist at RBC DS Global Markets. 

  She says the spread between 10-year Australian government bonds and the equivalent Treasurys issue could narrow to below 20 basis points, just above that level presently. But the extent of any narrowing would depend on where the spread stands before the July 28 inflation data release, given that the spread has come in quite dramatically this year. At the start of 1999, the spread was as high as 51 basis points. 

  Any rise in the spread back to 45 basis points or more would represent a good opportunity to take long positions in Australian bonds, says David Plank, fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank for Australia and New Zealand. 

  But some analysts say Australian bonds could struggle to extend their gains. 

  'We need to get good news to keep (bond) prices where they are,' said Paul Brennan, chief Australian economist at Salomon Smith Barney. 

  That suggests to some that Australian bonds will simply follow the direction of U.S. Treasurys, leaving the spread little changed. 

  And there's a greater danger that there will be some inflation surprise in the July 28 data which will trigger a selloff in Australian bonds. 

  'I think we only need to see a slightly higher-than-expected number to see the bond market sell off,' Brennan says. 'The market is pretty susceptible to bad news.' 

  Nevertheless, Brennan acknowledges that the yield spread could still hold at 20 basis points by year end, because of subdued inflation. 

  Craig James, chief economist at Colonial State Bank, said Australia's growing current account deficit is maintaining upward pressure on bond yields and limiting the scope for bond outperformance. Australia's first-quarter current account deficit stood at close to 6.0% of first-quarter gross domestic product. 

  'If we didn't have a current account deficit around 5% to 6% of GDP, clearly Australia should be trading below U.S. bonds,' giving a negative yield spread to Treasurys, said Craig James, chief economist with Colonial State Bank. 

  Australian bonds traded below Treasurys in May and June 1998 based because Australia's economic cycle was lagging the U.S.. But since then, the spread to Treasurys has been in positive territory, reflecting the premium demanded by offshore investors to hold Australian bonds given the growing current account deficit, James says. 

  'If you take all our factors into account, inflation, growth, productivity, wages growth, you would have to say Australia would have to be a magnet for offshore investors. 

  'Clearly Australia bonds are a magnet, but there is some degree of reticence about holding Australian bonds,' James said.

152,"Treasurys Drop On 2Q Rise In Labor Costs; Dlr Pressured

 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Treasurys fell sharply Thursday morning, as investors sifted through several economic numbers and concluded that labor costs and other factors are likely to put upward pressure on rates. 

  The morning's reports included news of a stronger-than-expected 1.1% rise in employment costs in the second quarter, offset by a slowdown in gross domestic product growth to 2.3%. At least early on, the market focused on the employment-costs number. 

  By 9:00 a.m. EDT, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 27/32 from late Wednesday, and down 20/32 from before the release, at 89 11/32, to yield 6.08%. At the Chicago Board of Trade, the September bond futures contract was trading at 115-02, down 26/32. 

  The dollar was under pressure, too. For example, currency investors were retesting the euro's Monday high of $1.0724, the U.S. currency was also nearing Y115.00. 

  U.S. employers saw their labor costs rise at the fastest clip in eight years in the second quarter, as the tightest labor market in three decades is intensifying inflationary pressures on the economy. The 1.1% rise was above a forecast of 0.8%. 

  Second-quarter employment costs are up 3.2% from the previous year's quarter. 

  ""The number has caused a lot of volatility in the past,"" said Ken Fan, bond strategist Paribas Capital Markets in New York. 

  The long bond yield spiked to 6.07% immediately after the release of the data, from 6.03% before the release. 

  Yields of shorter-dated notes also rose.

153,"Australia&apos;s Westpac Sees GST Adding 2.1 Pct Pts To CPI

 
 

  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. estimates that the introduction of a 10% goods and services tax will boost the consumer price index by 2.1 percentage points over the long term and cause third-quarter inflation to jump even more. 

  The government plans to introduce a 10% goods and services tax, or GST, in July, 2000, to replace the wide range of sales taxes it currently levies. 

  But to get the legislation through the Senate, where the government lacks a majority, it agreed with the Australian Democrats party late in May to exempt ""basic"" foods from the GST. 

  To pay for the cost of exempting basic foods from its GST, the government cut back on reductions of some indirect state taxes and reduced diesel fuel subsidies. 

  Warren Hogan, economist at Westpac Banking Corp., estimates those changes to the government's original broad-based tax will, in total, reduce the inflationary impact of the goods and services tax, or GST, by about seven percentage points over the long term. 

  The bank now estimates the GST will add 2.1 percentage points to the country's consumer price index over the long term, down from an original estimate of 2.8 percentage points. Most of the reduction is the result of exempting basic food from the GST, Hogan said in a research paper. 

  The government itself had estimated the original tax plan would add 1.9 percentage points to the CPI over the longer term. New government estimates are expected to be issued in December.

154,"AWSJ: Column/Fischer -2: Issue Awaits Decision From Clinton

 
 

  By Tim Fischer 

  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Tuesday's Asian Wall Street Journal. Fischer is Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for trade.) 

  HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--For the last nine months the Australian and New Zealand lamb industries have been involved in a difficult fight against calls from the American sheep-meat industry for tariffs and quotas to be placed on our exports to the U.S. The crude nature of the remedy proposals under consideration, combined with the lack of any reasonable case for punishing Australian lamb producers in this way, has turned the lamb issue into a huge test for our bilateral trade relationship, as well as for the United States' credentials as a world leader committed to free and fair trade. 

  On June 22, the United States Senate delivered a principled decision to resist the appeal of protectionism for the steel industry by setting aside a bill to impose quotas on steel imports. The American sheep-meat industry's recommendations, based on findings from the United States International Trade Commission, are now before U.S. President Bill Clinton for a final decision. The president must now show the same level of leadership on the lamb issue. 

  The governments of Australia and New Zealand have been pressing strongly against any decision to impose unjustified trade restraints, arguing this will do nothing to help the U.S. domestic industry, while it will penalize Australia's fairly traded, unsubsidized prime lamb exports and the American consumer. Putting trade barriers in place would be sadly ironic, even more so when done on the mere basis of a 'threat' of injury to U.S. lamb, which is all that the ITC has determined. Furthermore, the ITC found that Australia and New Zealand were not engaged in unfair trading. 

  Indeed, this latest wave of protectionism is not so much a response to pressures from overseas lamb producers. U.S. lamb producers are urging drastic tariff and quota measures in a knee-jerk reaction to difficulties in the domestic market. This is wrong-headed. The difficulties the producers face are not related to imports. They stem from an outmoded marketing approach that has sought to pitch prices for lamb at levels which are well out of line with prices for competing foodstuffs. 

  In Australia and New Zealand, where lamb meat is competitively priced, per capita consumption is 20 times that of the United States. An opportunity for U.S. lamb producers to achieve similar results is going begging. 

  Furthermore, efforts to limit imports can only backfire on U.S. lamb producers themselves. The U.S. industry must realize that keeping products at artificially high prices is no way to grow any market. Far from strengthening their industry, the protection domestic producers seek would only weaken the market for their product, hurting producers in the process. While consumers would be among the first to suffer, in time the lamb industry itself would face the prospect of further contraction as the domestic market became even more marginalized. 

  Recognizing the opportunities that exist both for ourselves and U.S. producers, Australian and New Zealand lamb producers generously offered to commit up to $1.5 million a year over four years toward joint promotion with U.S. industry. Unfortunately, this innovative and forward-looking offer was rejected by the U.S. industry out of hand. 

  Structural change is under way in the U.S. lamb industry. Like any industry, change will occur regardless of any Band-Aid protectionist fix. A more positive approach would be to undertake a realistic adjustment program with cooperation and fair competition from foreign producers. All stand to benefit. Should efforts to restrict foreign lamb imports into the U.S. succeed, however, everyone involved will suffer: those who wish to export lamb to the American market, American consumers and eventually even the American lamb industry itself. 

  Moreover, if President Clinton takes the wrong step on lamb, he will send the wrong signal to agricultural producers and governments in other countries. He will be saying that they can deal with the pressures of change by erecting barriers to trade. 

  With the U.S. set to host the vital WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle at the end of this year, it is not only Australia and New Zealand that will be sitting in judgment on how the U.S. administration responds to these unfair calls for import relief. The entire world will be watching. 

  In Auckland, New Zealand last month, trade ministers of the economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation met to plan for Seattle and to review the encouraging signs of economic recovery in East Asia. They recognized the remarkable commitment to free trade from economies that have suffered enormously during Asia's financial crisis - a commitment to keep their markets open when domestic pressures to close them have been intense. We and our neighbors have applauded the great contribution the United States has made toward recovery in Asia. 

  Yet history tells us that the pace of trade liberalization depends on the larger economies leading by example, and the success of Seattle will depend in large measure on the leadership of the United States. Such leadership can only be demonstrated if it is clear that the U.S. is committed to the principles of free trade and can resist protectionist pressure at home. 

  The recent outcome on the steel quota bill gives hope that President Clinton's endorsement of a new round of trade negotiations in his State of the Union address this year was meaningful. Australia hopes that this important step will be followed by the right decision in the lamb case. An industry threatened by change is best assisted by domestic adjustment support, not barriers to competition. All our industries hope for is the opportunity for us to work with the U.S. toward an outcome that will provide the basis for real, long-term prosperity for us all. 

  President Clinton now has an opportunity to deliver to the American people a win-win solution on this issue. A win for the forces of free trade, a win for American lamb producers - and above all, a win for American consumers.

155,"WSJ(7/27): Texaco Net Fell 20% In 2nd Quarter

 
  By Alexei Barrionuevo 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  Higher crude-oil prices and lucrative refining margins on the West Coast gave a huge boost to Atlantic Richfield Co. in the second quarter and cushioned a drop in earnings for Texaco Inc. 

  Like their competitors, both companies benefited from crude-oil prices that shot up to nearly $20 a barrel by the quarter's end and from tight gasoline supply in California, which pushed prices -- and profit margins -- well above the national average during the spring. 

  For Texaco, though, higher prices couldn't overcome the effect of weak refining margins overseas. Texaco's net income slid 20% to $273 million, or 50 cents a diluted share, from $342 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. That was slightly above Wall Street's expectations of 49 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

  The quarter included $76 million in asset write-downs and $67 million in employee separation costs, but they were largely offset by inventory valuation adjustments, gains on tax issues and gains on asset sales. Before special items, earnings were $286 million, or 52 cents a share. 

  Revenue rose 3% to $8.27 billion from $8.04 billion in 1998. 

  Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said exploration and production earnings, before special items, rose 34% to $216 million, reflecting crude-oil prices that were up about 19% from a year earlier and up about 40% from the first quarter. 

  Texaco's U.S. refining business is part of a joint venture with Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Aramco. The company said improved West Coast refining and marketing margins, due mostly to refinery fires and other outages that caused supply shortages, were partly offset by problems at a Puget Sound refinery and scheduled maintenance at its Los Angeles refinery. Refining earnings overseas, however, fell 61% before unusual items. 

  Texaco Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter I. Bijur said the company so far this year has cut per-barrel expenses by 9%, compared with a year earlier. 

  Arco, based in Los Angeles, more than doubled its net income to $313 million, or 95 cents a diluted share, from $154 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. 

  Excluding special items, profit was up 37% to $302 million, or 92 cents a diluted share, compared with $220 million, or 67 cents a share, last year. That beat analysts' estimate of 86 cents a share for the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

  Revenue climbed 21% to $3.22 billion from $2.65 billion in the year-earlier period. 

  Along with oil prices and California refining results, Arco Chairman and CEO Mike R. Bowlin credited the company's cost-cutting, saying that Arco expects to reach its goal of slashing $500 million in expenses by year end, one year ahead of schedule. 

  Arco said its refining and marketing earnings more than doubled to $206 million in the quarter, from $97 million in 1998. 

  Arco did it despite a scheduled shutdown at a Washington refinery that remained down most of June. Arco operates refineries in only five Western states, including California. 

  Oil and natural-gas production rose 10% in the quarter, helping push after-tax exploration and production profit to $174 million, up from $17 million in the yearearlier quarter, after a $75 million writedown of a gas field. 

  Shares of Texaco fell $1.50 to close at $60.875, while those of Arco dropped $1.8125 to close at $87.625, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

156,"S African Ctrl Bk -2: Won&apos;t Be Pushed Into Lower Rates

 
 

  JOHANNESBURG (Dow Jones)--Incoming South African Central Bank Governor Tito Mboweni Saturday reiterated his pledge to carry on the bank's tough monetarists approach, ruling out populist measures like pushing interest rates lower. 

  ""Artificial low interest rates - forget it,"" he told a media briefing. 

  ""It's a cost you will have to pay a couple of years down the line"" if softer credit is pursed, he said. 

  South African government interest rates, through the securities repurchase rate, has fallen 8.25 percentage points to 13.600% since last October. But the pace of the decline has all but stopped in the past week. 

  Elements within the government are keen for rates to fall further so as to accelerate current anemic economic growth in the country. 

  Mboweni takes the helm of the the South African Reserve Bank Sunday, succeeding Chris Steals, a veteran of 44 years at the central bank, the last 10 years as governor. 

  Mboweni said controlling inflation remained a priority of the central bank and that it is considering setting growth targets in accordance with the government. 

  He said he hadn't talked about the issue with Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, who earlier this week predicted the establishment of a mutually agreeable inflation-target range by the first quarter of 2000. 

  ""I hope the process (of setting targets) will be co-managed"" with the finance ministry, Mboweni said.

157,"WSJ(8/25): Prices Of Wood Products Plunge

 
  By Jim Carlton 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  Wood-products prices have plunged from their record and near-record levels of only a few weeks ago amid an unexpected supply glut that analysts said again illustrates the timber industry's volatility. 

  Analysts cautioned that any slowdown in either the economy or housing market could cut short a resurgence in the timber industry that has been under way for much of the year. More likely, they said, is that markets will stabilize and even rebound as housing and remodeling activity pick up - as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't move to raise interest rates too much. Fed policy makers increased interest rates one-quarter percentage point yesterday. 

  ""This industry ebbs and flows according to what the general market does,"" said Karl Lindberg, president of the Southern Forest Products Association, an industry trade group in Kenner, La. 

  As of Friday, the composite price per 1,000 board feet of framing lumber had fallen to $391 - a 20% drop from the record level of $490 reached in mid-July and the fifth consecutive weekly decrease, according to Random Lengths, an industry newsletter in Eugene, Ore. Prices also have been falling in other forestry products such as structural paneling, which dropped 26% to $333 per 1,000 board feet as of Friday from a high of $453 on July 16, according to officials at Random Lengths who add that these are the most precipitous drops in six years. 

  The price drops come as something of a surprise in the industry, which has watched prices increase for 10 months in a row on demand fueled primarily by a robust U.S. housing market. That trend led to unexpectedly strong earnings reports by many of the timber companies, such as Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Portland, Ore., and Plum Creek Timber Co., Seattle, in the second quarter. 

  Although the housing market remains strong, industry executives say the supply of wood products recently exceeded demand in part because of the unusually hot summer weather in many parts of the country. That led to construction delays that backed up timber products in the distribution pipeline, they say. 

  Timber production, meanwhile, has ramped up rapidly. The amount of timber products made on the West Coast jumped 11% through June from the same period last year, while they rose 7% in the South and 5.6% in the Mountain West over the same time, according to estimates by industry trade groups. 

  ""The numbers have been spectacular in terms of production, exceeding everyone's expectation,"" said Mike O'Halloran, president of the Western Wood Products Association, a trade group based in Portland. 

  Timber manufacturers aren't expressing too much concern over the price drops just yet. While few will predict when prices might bottom out, most people in the industry view the situation as a temporary setback to a recovery they say could last for two or more years. During the second quarter, the industry pulled out of a two-year slump that was prompted by an oversupply of wood products and slackened demand from Asian markets. 

  ""You have to remember where prices were when they started coming off,"" said Keith Matheney, vice president of core businesses at Louisiana-Pacific. ""This is in my view a normal correction."" 

  Indeed, manufacturers report continued strong demand in the U.S. for lumber and other wood products. 

  ""The other thing helping us is that Europe is getting better and is likely to continue improving over the next five years,"" said Rick Holley, chief executive of Plum Creek. ""I think the overall industry is going to have an excellent year."" 

  Analysts pointed out, though, that the timber industry remains a highly volatile sector whose fortunes can change overnight. Aside from being prone to the vagaries of economic cycles, analysts said the industry suffers from being fragmented into thousands of producers who frequently manufacture excess quantities. ""We are sort of guessing where we go from here,"" said Burrle Elmore, editor of Random Lengths.

158,"Venezuelan Official: Oil-Price Rise May Obviate New Debt

 

  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Venezuelan Planning Minister Jorge Giordani suggested Tuesday that the country may not issue foreign debt, or simply reduce the amount it originally sought in overseas capital markets this year. 

  The sustained rise in oil prices could mean windfall revenues of up to $1.2 billion, Giordani said in answer to questions on whether Venezuela still plans to raise $1.4 billion to $2 billion abroad. 

  He didn't elaborate. 

  The executive branch is looking to finance a 1999 budget deficit equivalent to 9% of gross domestic product, or about $9 billion. 

  Giordani said the economy is still on course to meet the official 1999 inflation target of 20% to 24%, which is down from the near 30% rise in prices last year. 

  Venezuela's consumer price index rose 1.6% in July, up from the 1.5% rise posted in June but down from the 2.1% increase in July of last year. 

  Inflation for the first seven months of the year amounted to 11.9%, down markedly from 18.2% the year before, the Central Bank of Venezuela announced Monday. 

  Giordani said the executive branch believes the economy will recuperate ""soon,"" and added that the recovery in demand wouldn't fuel inflation. He didn't, however, explain why. 

  But economists point out that the collapse in demand is precisely the reason inflation growth has been moderating. 

  Economists reckon the economy will contract by between 4% and 9% this year.

159,"WSJ(8/31): Major Makers Of Cigarettes Raise Prices

 
  By Gordon Fairclough 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos., maker of Marlboros, raised prices on all of its major cigarette brands by 18 cents a pack, and other tobacco companies immediately followed suit. 

  Discounts offered by the cigarette makers may help soften the blow to smokers in the near term. But David J. Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York, estimates the retail price of a pack of cigarettes next year will average about $2.65, nearly $1 more than in 1997. 

  The price increase is the second largest in history, after a 45-cent-a-pack boost last November, when tobacco companies agreed to pay $206 billion to 46 states that had sued seeking to recover money spent caring for people with smoking-related diseases. 

  Cigarette makers confirmed the 18-cent-a-pack increase, but declined to comment further. Analysts said the latest jump will cover an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes, which goes up by 10 cents a pack starting Jan. 1. Another four cents of the per-pack increase is needed to pay tobacco companies' obligations under various legal settlements, they said. The remaining four cents a pack amounts to a fairly standard annual price rise for the industry. 

  ""If they didn't take this price increase, profits would have been under pressure,"" Mr. Adelman said. 

  Besides Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette maker, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc., maker of Camels, British American Tobacco PLC's Brown & Williamson unit and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco Co. subsidiary also boosted their prices, a move that is likely to widen profit margins through the end of the year, analysts said. 

  In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Philip Morris shares were up 18.75 cents to $37.75; R.J. Reynolds shares fell 12.5 cents to $28, and Loews shares fell 87.5 cents to $78.625. American depositary shares of British American Tobacco were unchanged at $17.5625 on the American Stock Exchange. 

  The higher prices could further damp demand for cigarettes. But low unemployment and the buoyant economy, which have put more disposable income in the hands of smokers, may blunt any decline, said Martin Feldman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. 

  The price increase came earlier than expected by wholesalers, preventing them from stocking up on cigarettes at the old, lower prices. ""It was a big surprise when we got the telegram last Friday afternoon,"" said Del Peterson, president of Moreland Wholesale Inc., in Cheyenne, Wyo. Mr. Peterson complained that wholesalers will get pinched, since they have to start paying the new prices before they can raise the prices they charge retailers. 

  The timing of the price rise, well ahead of the tax increase and settlement obligations that will kick in next year, also gives tobacco companies plenty of flexibility to offer discounts to customers, Mr. Feldman said. ""Consumers will only gradually feel the price increase,"" he predicted. 

  After last year's sharp price rise, cigarette makers used aggressive discounts and promotions to keep smokers from abandoning premium brands in favor of lower-cost alternatives. The strategy worked, Mr. Feldman said, preventing serious erosion of the big-name brands' market share. 

  Even so, some cigarette sellers caution that sooner or later, the price increases will turn off smokers. ""They're going to drive everybody to lower priced brands and roll-your-own,"" said Michael P. Washo, owner of Carolina Tobacco Emporium in Enfield, Conn. He said he has seen a sharp increase in sales of loose tobacco and rolling paper to customers who now prefer to make their own cigarettes.

  Turning to inflation, McDonough, who arrived in South Africa Friday morning, said he hadn't had a chance to digest Friday's batch of U.S. labor data - which analysts said was clearly inflationary. 

  Nevertheless, the Fed deputy chairman said the U.S. central bank had to be ""attentive"" to a situation where labor costs rise beyond productivity gains. 

  Late this week, the U.S. economy was presented with clear evidence of this, through a series of government data. 

   McDonough refused to be drawn on the monetary policy implications of the most recent figures, but said ""by far, the best time to do anything about inflation is early."" 

  On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said employers added 310,000 more workers to their payrolls in July - well above expectations of a rise of 206,000. At the same time, workers' average hourly earnings rose by 0.5%, or six cents, last month, higher than predictions for a 0.3% increase. It was the fastest monthly wage climb in six months. 

  The set of figures followed data showing a softening in productivity improvement. 

  Global markets were spooked Friday by these worse-than- expected numbers and sold off. 

  McDonough offered no view on whether the latest inflationary figures warranted a tightening of U.S. credit. 

  The Fed last raised interest rates in late June, lifting the Federal Funds rate 25 basis points to 5%.

161,"WSJ(9/7): Foreign Exchange: Dollar Regains Some Strength

 
  By Marianne Sullivan 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  The dollar seemed back in fashion Friday as investor sentiment did an aboutface, following signs U.S. inflation might be less threatening than feared. 

  ""Market sentiment has swung away from expecting a rate hike,"" said Marc Chandler, currency strategist at Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank. However, Mr. Chandler still expects the dollar to trade lower in the early part of this week, from 108.80 yen to 110.50 yen. He expects the euro to trade in a range of $1.0500 to $1.0700 in the early part of the week. 

  The dollar has tended recently to follow movements in U.S. stocks and bonds, which have been pressured by expectations of tighter monetary policy. Friday, the U.S. currency shared a relief rally with stocks and bonds after the August employment report showed less overheating in the economy than expected. 

  In late-afternoon trading Friday, the dollar was at 109.93 yen, up from 109.13 yen late Thursday. The euro was trading at $1.0613, down from $1.0690. Sterling was at $1.0620, down from $1.0675. 

  The New York exchange markets were closed yesterday to observe Labor Day. 

  With the market living from indicator to indicator and comment to comment, a firm commitment to bid the dollar higher or lower against either currency will be stymied by the anxiety ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech tomorrow in Michigan, Japan's long-awaited gross-domestic-product numbers Thursday and U.S. producer prices Friday. 

  ""A lot will depend on the other side of the equation, with rising optimism about the euro zone and Japan, "" said Kathy Jones, currency analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. 

  The euro, she said, should be the beneficiary of the uncertainty surrounding both U.S. and Japanese fundamentals. 

  Since the dollar began its decline in mid-July, the euro has moved about 5% higher since bottoming out July 13 at $1.0108. The yen, however, has moved more than 10% higher since its July 8 low of 122.75 yen. Ms. Jones said the euro has more room to move higher. 

  Investors wanting to get out of dollar holdings are reluctant to buy yen due to the currency's potential for a quick decline if Japan intervenes to halt its appreciation or next week's GDP numbers fail to validate Japan's recovery story. 

  The yen, which has been a favorite for investors and hedgers, is considered overbought, Ms. Jones said. 

  Last Wednesday, it posted a seven-and-a-half-month high of 108.73 yen against the dollar. But at these higher levels, she said, the currency is vulnerable and could decline rapidly if the Bank of Japan opts to limit the currency rise or Friday's growth numbers disappoint investors. Mr. Chandler said positioning in preparation for central-bank intervention and Japan's growth numbers should be the driving force behind the dollar's trade this week. 

  Meanwhile, financial problems brewing in emerging markets-debt restructuring in Ecuador, Chile's float of its currency and renewed currency woes in Thailandcould eventually lead spooked international investors back into the dollar. 

  A lingering political wrangle over the Taiwan Strait has already weighed considerably on the yen against the dollar in several Asian sessions this week. 

  Any development interpreted as bringing Beijing and Taipei closer to armed conflict would buoy the dollar. The New Taiwan dollar was at NT$31.750 late Friday, unchanged from Thursday. 

  The U.S. dollar was at 1,191 won, up a bit from 1,190 won. 

  Steven Xu, a treasury economist at the Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong, said although developments in corporate sector will continue to drive volatile swings in the dollar-won exchange rate this week, the U.S. currency should remain within a broad 1,180 won to 1,200 won band. 

  But South Korean Friday pledged to defend five Yellow Sea islands after North Korea threatened to use military force to gain control of contested waters around them. If shooting breaks out, the dollar would rise on ""flight to safety"" buying.

162,"Thai Fin Min: Oil Prices Higher On Global Mkt, Not Baht

 
 

  BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Thursday the government shouldn't take immediate action to ease domestic oil prices, because the increases in oil prices are due mostly to global market factors, rather than local or currency factors. 

  Tarrin told reporters after a speech to foreign businessmen and the Thai Customs Department that the government should wait for the results of an upcoming meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries before deciding to take action. 

  Industry Minister Suwat Liptapanlop said earlier Thursday that domestic oil prices were at their highest levels this year, and the government was looking at what it could do to stem further increases. 

  The retail price of unleaded premium gasoline is up 0.30 baht (THB) on last week's levels to THB13.29. 

  Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar had risen to around THB39.70 midday Thursday, from less than THB39 last week. 

  Tarrin said high oil prices shouldn't affect growth prospects this year. The government recently revised its 1999 gross domestic product growth target to 3%, from 1%. 

  But with much of the population still suffering from the effects of a two-year recession, the government has been under pressure to cut taxes on oil as a means of easing the burden of higher prices. 

  Private refining and retailing firms, on the other hand, have been complaining that the state Petroleum Authority of Thailand's, or PTT, retail gas stations have only been able to maintain such low prices because of state subsidies. The private firms have to match PTT to maintain market share, but say they are losing money.

  But according to a survey released Tuesday, Australian manufacturers expected the economy will continue to grow strongly in coming months, creating the most positive outlook for employment growth in more than four years. The survey was carried out by the Australian Chamber of Commerce & Industry and Westpac Banking Corp. 

  Cost pressures are expected to rise in the next six months due to a tightening labor market and higher oil prices, the survey said. 

  The Bureau of Statistics will release its wage cost index for the second quarter at 0130 GMT Wednesday. 

  Analysts on average forecast a modest 0.6% rise in the index in the second quarter from the first quarter, down from a 0.9% rise in the first quarter. 

  The index measures movements in underlying wages by calculating the change in the wage and salary cost of a sampling of jobs. 

  Grant Fitzner, an economist at HSBC Market, said annual wage costs are stuck around 3.0%, which is very modest wage inflation and ""quite easily affordable."" 

  Assuming a consumer price inflation of 2.0%, then productivity growth of only 1.0% is needed to pay for 3.0% wages growth, Fitzner said. 

  The Reserve Bank of Australia previously has said it expects the consumer price index to rise to about 2.0% in the first half of 2000. The consumer price index rose 1.1% on year in the second quarter of 1999.

164,"Vietnam Electricity Price -3: Money Needed For Development

 

  Vietnam's electricity charges are subsidized by the state in order to ensure that customers can afford a steady supply of power for their homes and factories. 

  But the World Bank and other development agencies have long pushed Hanoi to increase its power prices. They say the government must increase the amount it charges end-users in order to raise the funds needed to improve Vietnam's still-basic power supply structure. 

  Power failures are common in Vietnam's major cities, and many rural areas still have no access to electricity other than through the use of local generators. 

  ""It is necessary to apply (higher electricity) prices so that the power industry can have more money for development,"" the pricing committee official said Thursday. 

  According to the new government decree, urban households from October 1 will pay a minimum of 500 dong ($1=VND13,984) a kilowatt hour for the power they use, while rural residents will pay VND360/kwh. Previous residential power prices weren't stated in the decision - a copy of which was obtained by Dow Jones Newswires - but the pricing committee official said Hanoi's new price structure represents an average 6% increase over previous power costs. 

  He said businesses and administrative offices will from next month pay an average of 10% to 12% more for their power than they pay now. 

  The pricing committee will outline different costs for electricity use during the day and during the night, in a bid to help spread demand for power over each 24-hour period and prevent power shortages during peak hours, he added.

  Similarly, the Ecuadorean sucre was weakening 5.5% to ECS12,915 against the dollar, as nervousness over the country's ability to meet an upcoming payment on its Brady bonds led to a selloff in the beleaguered currency, according to local traders. 

  Government officials have yet to make an official statement on whether the country will be able to make the payment, leading to speculation on scenarios ranging from Ecuador restructuring its debt to the country declaring a debt moratorium. 

  Ecuadorean officials are expected to discuss options with IMF officials next week during the annual IMF meetings. 

  Meanwhile, the Mexican peso rose to its strongest point in nine weeks, on the back of positive economic numbers and higher oil prices. 

  Banking leader Banamex quoted the Mexican peso at MXN9.285, compared with Tuesday's close of MXN9.302. 

  Mexico is expected to release positive preliminary trade figures for August later in the session. 

  ""Fundamentals are strong and (the Mexican peso) is increasingly less affected by the Dow,"" one U.S.-based trader said, referring to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has been slipping in the past few sessions. 

  Higher oil prices have also helped to boost the Mexican currency, as oil is a major export and source of the country's foreign currency revenues. 

  Meanwhile, the Brazilian real was nearly unchanged from Tuesday's close, as the central bank sold about BRR500 million in dollar-linked notes ahead of an expected rate cut later in the session. 

  At 3:00 p.m. EDT, the Brazilian real was trading at a mid-rate of BRR1.887, compared with Tuesday's close of BRR1.886. 

  The auction had served as a hedging device for market participants, in turn supporting the sliding currency since the real nearly hit BRR2.00 in Aug. 20. The bank is expected to offer more dollar-linked notes Friday. 

  The U.S.-based trader said he expects the central bank to slice the benchmark Selic interest rate target by 25 basis points from its current level of 19.5%. Market consensus on the expected cut ranges from 25 to 50 basis points. The bank has been steadily reducing the Selic target since peaking at 45% in March. 

  Meanwhile, smaller Latin American currencies were weaker. 

  The Peruvian sol ended slightly higher as corporations bought the local currency to pay off taxes, one local trader said. 

  The Venezuelan bolivar and Chilean peso both weakened.

166,"Australian Wages Growth -2: Labor Mkt Isn&apos;t Tight

 
 

  With the Australian economy growing at a rapid pace, economists have brought forward forecasts of interest rate rises ahead of the introduction of an inflationary 10% goods and service tax next July. 

  Many analysts are now predicting a 25-basis-point or 50-basis-point rise in interest rates after the Reserve Bank of Australia meets for its next monthly policy meeting Nov. 2. 

  But Giltrap doesn't expect a sharp rise in interest rates over the next year. The key overnight cash rate now stands at 4.75%. 

  ""The unemployment rate has blipped up so we don't have the labor market tightness that they do in the U.S.,"" which is part of the reason the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 50 basis points since June, she said. Australia's unemployment rate stood at 7.4% in September, compared to 4.2% in the U.S. 

  Giltrap predicts that wages growth will remain well below 4.5% over the next 12 months, ""below what the Reserve Bank of Australia would be concerned about."" 

  Earlier Tuesday, a report released by HSBC Markets in Australia found that major Australian federal wage agreements reached in the third quarter rose by an annualized average of 3.4%, down from 3.5% in the quarter before. 

  Federal wage agreements are certified by the Australian Industrial Relation Commission. About one-fifth of the Australian workforce is currently covered by federal agreements. 

  Commenting on the report, John Edwards, chief economist with HSBC Markets, said benign wages growth will limit the central bank in raising interest rates to between 50 basis points and 75 basis points over the coming year.

167,"WHITE HOUSE WATCH: Spooked By Jittery Stock Market

 
 

  By Alex Keto 

  A Dow Jones Newswires Analysis 

 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--It took a teetering stock market Friday to get the Clinton administration to drop some of its budget bluster and take the threat of a partial government shutdown off the negotiating table. 

  For the first time, White House officials promised publicly that U.S. President Bill Clinton will sign a new continuing resolution, or temporary spending bill, when the current one expires at the end of next week. 

  ""The president is not interested in shutting any of the government down,"" said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 

  Until now, White House officials had repeatedly said maybe Clinton would sign a new CR, or, maybe he wouldn't. The tactic was designed to put maximum pressure on the Republicans in Congress to move forward with passing the spending bills needed to fund the entire federal in fiscal year 2000. 

  However, after remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and poor inflation outlook figures frightened investors, the White House apparently figured that adding another element of instability to the financial markets was unwise at best. 

  What spooked investors was the combination of Greenspan's cautioning banks they need to set aside reserves for any downdraft in stock prices and the news the producer price index jumped 1.1% in September from the month earlier. 

 

  Treasury Secretary Summers Gives Marching Orders 

 

  With early indications showing the Dow Jones Industrial Average would open sharply lower, the White House mobilized quickly Friday morning to do what little it could to prevent a retreat from becoming a stampede. 

  Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers gave White House officials explicit instructions on what they could say and what the couldn't say to restore a semblance of confidence. 

  ""I think it is important to remember the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. While we monitor all economic indicators, we base government policy and economic policy on overall long-term economic trends,"" Lockhart said parroting Summers' message. 

  Asked if he could comment directly on the prospect for inflation in the economy, Lockhart said he couldn't because remarks along these lines hadn't been cleared by the Treasury secretary. 

  National Economic Council Chairman Gene Sperling was given greater latitude and used it during a brief appearance with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on a separate matter. 

  Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing, Sperling said the administration expects continued growth coupled with low inflation. 

  In a surprise move, Sperling also gave an early indication of what the third quarter gross domestic product will look like to support his forecast. 

  ""The third quarter GDP numbers should be quite solid,"" Sperling said. He didn't elaborate on this prediction, but administration officials rarely if ever offer previews of economic figures. 

 

  Trying To Find A Sanction To Slap On Pakistan 

 

  William Milam, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, met Pakistani Army Chief of Staff Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf for two hours Friday but found the general unwilling to make any commitment to return Pakistan to civilian rule soon. 

  Rebuffed, the White House began a search for an economic sanction to slap on Pakistan but was stymied by the fact that it has already slapped a number of sanctions on Islamabad because of its nuclear weapons tests. 

  ""The lawyers are looking at this now....In practical terms, there's already a wide range of sanctions applied against Pakistan,"" Lockhart said. 

  Likewise, the U.S. will have little success in trying to put pressure on Pakistan by seeking to block the International Monetary Fund from giving Islamabad loans. The IMF has already suspended its loan program to Pakistan anyway. 

  ""At this point, it's a bit of a moot point,"" Lockhart conceded. 

  ""If they get to the point where they come into compliance, we'll take a look at whether the behavior of the military government there warrants the United States' looking at blocking further loans,"" Lockhart said.

168,"REPEAT:Iraq Al-Anbari Sees $22 As &quot;Reasonable Oil Price&quot;

 
 

  BAGHDAD (AP)--The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should work towards ""a reasonable price"" for crude oil in the range of $22 a barrel, Iraq's candidate for OPEC secretary general said Monday. 

  Abdulamir al-Anbari, in a telephone interview from Paris, also dismissed reports that Iraq will drop his nomination in return for political concessions from Saudi Arabia. 

  ""$22 is a reasonable price...If prices shoot to $28 or $30 that will be too high,"" al-Anbari said. 

  The 1999 average of OPEC's basket price is currently $15.49 a barrel. 

  The value of the reference basket of seven crude oils used by the OPEC as a gauge of world oil price levels averaged $22.85 a barrel Friday. 

  Al-Anbari's remarks contradict those by Iraqi parliamentary speaker Saadoun Hammadi Sunday in which he called on OPEC to cut production further to raise oil prices to more than $33 a barrel. 

  They also run contrary to those by President Saddam Hussein who was reported as telling his cabinet last month that the price was still too low and accused the U.S. of manipulating the market. 

  OPEC ministers, who met in Vienna last month, agreed to keep their oil cutbacks in place through the end of March 2000. But they were deadlocked on the issue of selecting a new secretary general with Rilwanu Lukman remaining in place until next March. 

  Al-Anbari now competes with candidates from OPEC's two biggest members - Saudi Arabia's Suleiman Jasir al-Herbish and Iran's Hossein Kazempour Ardebili. 

  ""What political concessions my government can expect from Saudi Arabia? Nothing. Regarding sanctions, that is in the hands of America,"" al-Anbari said. 

  Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid, in a news conference last week, described al-Anbari as ""the most qualified"" among OPEC's candidates. ""The Iraqi candidate,"" he said, ""is the one who will guarantee OPEC's independence...and safeguard it against external influences."" 

  Iraq has repeatedly accused Saudi Arabia of producing more crude than what it should in a bid to flood markets and lower prices to serve U.S. strategic interests in the region. 

  Rashid said Iraq had no intention of dropping al-Anbari's nomination. 

  Al-Anbari, however, said he was certain the Saudis and others will block his nomination but added many in OPEC opted for ""the most efficient, the most qualified"" to take the job. 

  And since OPEC rules require a unanimous decision in appointing a secretary general, al-Anbari suggested the formation of a high-level committee to decide who is better-placed to win the top job among the three candidates. 

  ""Many (OPEC) ministers have agreed to this proposal,"" he said. 

  Iraq nominated al-Anbari just before the OPEC talks last month, a move many saw as a maneuver to block a Saudi or Iranian winning the job following the withdrawal of Algeria's Oil Minister Yousef Yousefi. 

  Oil Ministry officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had nothing against the qualifications of the Saudi candidate. ""He's a good man but our candidate is also of a high caliber,"" said one. 

  Anbari holds law degrees from Baghdad University and Harvard University and has held many posts in the Iraqi oil industry in the late 1960s through the 1970s. He also served in the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries and was director of the OPEC legal department for more than 25 years ago. 

  He has been Iraq's ambassador to Britain and the U.S. and was Baghdad's U.N. envoy during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In 1992, he became Iraq's envoy to UNESCO in Paris and led the Iraqi team in negotiations for the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal.

169,"Treasurys -2: Rate Uncertainty Main Theme Of Market

 
 

  Despite the recent spike in oil and other commodity prices, investors and brokers have become so impermeable to bad inflation news that the market showed little reaction to a slew of data showing consumer spending remains rampant and the labor market remains tight. 

  The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose an unexpected 10,000 to 312,000 in the week that ended Oct. 2, partly reflecting the lingering effects of flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd. 

  The increase surprised Wall Street, which had expected claims to decline after a big gain in the previous week, yet the market didn't seem to take notice. 

  Meanhwile, job cuts for September increased 7% from August, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm attributed the monthly rise to ongoing efforts to shut down unprofitable units and reduce staff. 

  At the same time, an analysis of sales at 69 retailers by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi places September same-store sales 6.7% above year-ago levels, equaling August's gain. 

  This was consistent with a similar survey run by Salomon Smith Barney, whose chain store index was up 6.3% in September from a year ago, also matching August's gain. 

  Yet a third report Thursday showed U.S. consumer credit expanded sharply in August, making for another sign of Americans' willingness to continue spending. 

  The Federal Reserve said Thursday that outstanding consumer credit advanced at a 9.6% annual rate, or by $10.8 billion, in August - the fastest increase in dollar terms since January, which saw a $15.3 billion increase, the Fed said. 

  The number underscores the strength in domestic consumption, which is what worries Federal Reserve officials. The Federal Open Market Committee announced Tuesday it was leaning toward tighter monetary policy ahead, noting that ""growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply."" 

  This consumption news will become an irritant factor for the voting members of the FOMC, as this survey suggests consumers have not slowed down their spending spree despite recent monetary policy tightening. 

  Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and CNBC are calling for an increase of 220,000 in payrolls in September, and for the unemployment rate to remain steady at 4.2%. 

  Yet, despite all of the potentially negative news late, the market didn't react, preferring to mark time ahead of the payroll number. This is because the market has already adequately priced in the potential rate move. 

  For example, Treasury market observers noted that the yield curve has flattened since the Federal Reserve adopted a ""tightening bias"" Tuesday, with the yields of longer-dated maturities moving closer together with the shorter-dated Treasurys. 

  But even though the market has rebounded off of its lows Thursday, analysts say that investors remain extremely cautious and defensive. 

  ""The market is directionless and it's searching for a theme,"" said David Greenlaw, money market economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. Inc. in New York. 

  ""But it's unlikely it find direction in Friday's number,"" he added, ""as there's a series of data due out between now and Nov. 16 that could potentially steer the Fed one way or another.""

170,"Kazakstan Forced To Sell Tengiz Oil Stake - Official

 

  ALMATY, Kazakstan (Dow Jones)--The government of Kazakstan is forced to sell a part of its stake in international oil operating consortium, Tengizchevroil, because of its cash crisis, a top official said Monday. 

  ""The general economic situation is forcing"" the government to sell a part of its holding in the consortium, which operates the country's biggest oil field, Tengiz, said Kananbek Zhumin, director at state oil company Kazakoil. 

  Like several top Kazak officials, Zhumin said he is against the plan to reduce the government's stake in the company, possibly the state's most valuable asset. The plan, initially announced by the then-Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, has prompted unusually vocal opposition in Kazakstan's government circles. 

  Analysts say the government needs a massive privatization deal before the end of this year, to plug a budget gap, largely caused by low world oil prices early this year, as well as the financial crisis in neighboring Russia last year. 

  Zhumin said Monday the government has approached 20 major oil companies with an offer that is thought to involve 10% of the operating company. 

  ""Officially, I can say there have been such talks, but as far as I know, there has so far been no final decision,"" Zhumin said. 

  Kazakstan is in the middle of a government crisis after Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev resigned Friday, officially to return to Kazakhoil as the company's president. The country, where the powerful president appoints the ministers, is now run by an acting government. 

  The Kazakoil official Monday declined to name the government's asking price. 

  ""It is in the billions,"" Zhumin said. 

  Press reports have put the asking price between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion. Last week, Russia's biggest oil company, OAO Lukoil, said it is interested in acquiring the stake but called the Kazak government's asking price ""excessive."" 

  The other members of the consortium - Chevron (CHV) and Mobil (MOB) - are also thought to be considering the Kazak government's preliminary offer. 

  France's Total Fina S.A. (TOT), which is a stake holder in another Kazakstan-based consortium, the Offshore Kazakstan International Operating Company (OKIOC), has also announced its interest in the stake. 

  Tengizchevroil produces 220,000 barrels oil crude oil a day, with an output of 260,000 b/d targeted by the middle of next year, according to the consortium. 

  Large-scale privatization sales have become the government's recurrent resolution to its wide budget deficits. 

  Late last year Kazakstan helped balance its budget by selling its stake in OKIOC to the U.S.'s Phillips Petroleum and Japan's Inpex. 

  This year, Kazakstan's cash needs will also depend on the government's ability to reach a new loan deal with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 

  After talks at last week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, the loan negotiations are expected to resume later this month. 

  Kazakstan targets an oil output of 28.5 million metric tons this year, compared with 26.0 million tons in 1998, a senior official from the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Trade said, also speaking at the Monday press conference.

171,"Verbatim Text Of The FOMC Decision On Interest Rates

 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The following is the verbatim text of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announcement Tuesday afternoon. 

  The Federal Open Market Committee today voted to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1/2%. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate to 5.0%. 

  Although cost pressures appear generally contained, risks to sustainable growth persist. Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity, the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential. As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue. 

  Today's increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy actions in June and August and the firming of conditions more generally in U.S. financial markets over the course of the year, should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward. As a consequence, the directive the Federal Open Market Committee adopted is symmetrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term. 

  In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and Kansas City. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

172,"WSJ(11/11): US Oct PPI Declines 0.1%; Core Rate Up 0.3%

 
  By John McKinnon 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Producer prices fell in October for the first time in eight months, but underlying the good news were some potentially troublesome trends. 

  The Labor Department said the producer-price index declined 0.1% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, helped by big drops in food and energy costs. But the so-called core rate of prices, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, was up by 0.3%, a lot more than the 0.1% economists had projected. 

  That number was affected largely by big one-month increases for autos (1.1%) and prescription drugs (1.2%). Although observers in both industries said the jumps likely were exaggerated by statistical factors, some economists couldn't help but suspect that real-world price pressures also are at work. That could draw the attention of Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet Tuesday to decide whether the hot U.S. economy needs an interest-rate increase to cool off. 

  Of the two widely noted factors in yesterday's numbers, the drug-price increase attracted more attention, because of recent drug-industry merger activity as well as the political heat being generated by the issue. 

  On Tuesday, the House Democratic leadership and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton held a Capitol Hill rally to tout President Clinton's proposed prescriptiondrug benefit for Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and the disabled. In addition, some consumer advocates worry about the possible impact of growing concentration in the industry. 

  Several analysts noted that drug companies often implement price increases toward the end of the year, in hopes of affecting orders placed for the new calendar year. In addition, the analysts noted that some new drugs with fewer side effects are being priced at significant premiums. 

  The analysts added that some genericdrug makers have been more aggressive about raising prices in recent years, a trend that could have contributed to the October drug-price jump. The drug categories that saw the largest increases include some with a significant generic-drug presence, including hormones (5.3%), antiarthritics (4.5%), analgesics (2.6%), and dermatologicals (2.5%), said William Snyders, a Labor Department economist. 

  Still, several industry analysts viewed the October drug-price jump as an anomaly. In general, price increases in recent months ""are nothing different than what we've seen the last four-five years,"" said Hemant Shah, pharmaceuticals analyst for HKS & Co. 

  The increase in auto prices appeared to be affected in part by record-breaking demand for cars this year, analysts said. That put more year-2000 models into the sales mix as soon as they were available, said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, McLean, Va. 

  From October 1998 to October 1999, prices for new cars are up only 0.3% on a nonseasonally adjusted basis, he said. The producer-price report reflects ""an anomaly in the inventory of new cars,"" Mr. Taylor said. 

  A record total of 16.8 million units (cars and light trucks) are likely to be sold in the U.S. in 1999, Mr. Taylor said. The old record of 16.04 million units was set in 1986. 

  David Littman, chief economist at Comerica Inc. in Detroit, also pointed to the weakening dollar as a key factor, as it makes foreign cars more expensive in the U.S. ""Competition remains a restraining factor, but nothing is more powerful than a reversal of the strengthening dollar,"" he said. 

  But major foreign auto makers insist the fierce pricing battles in the marketplace mean they have little room to pass the effect of a weaker dollar on to consumers. 

  The producer-price report comes in time to influence Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Fed officials have said the producerprice numbers don't matter much in their decision-making about interest rates because they are so much narrower than the consumer-price index, which doesn't come out again until Wednesday. Some economists said the PPI number will carry more weight this time. 

  ""The greater-than-expected rise in the core PPI has swayed our expectations for a Nov. 16th rate hike,"" said analysts at Warburg Dillon Read, Stamford, Conn. ""We now put a 60-40 probability"" on a one-quarter point rate increase. 

  Overall, the October producer-price numbers were a big improvement over September, when the core rate jumped 0.8%. Excluding the increase for autos and light trucks, in fact, the Labor Department said that the core rate would have been in line with expectations. Still, policy makers aren't likely to dismiss the auto- and drug-price increases as mere statistical noise, Warburg analysts said. ""We don't believe the Fed is going to play this game,""said Joe Carson, a Warburg economist. 

  Analysts also noted that price pressures seem to be building further back in the producer pipeline. For example, prices for intermediate-stage goods other than food and energy were up 0.4%, said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C. Also, of the more than 60 core intermediate-stage materials, prices of more than two-thirds increased, he said. ""I see a continuation of the gradual but consistent upturn in inflationary pressures,"" Mr. Orr said. 

  Other analysts made much less of the latest report. Over the past 12 months, in fact, producer-price growth remained relatively tame at 2.7%. ""This is marginally negative news that shouldn't fundamentally alter inflation expectations,"" said Jay Feldman, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. 

  As for any rise in pipeline pressures, he said, that probably will take a backseat to recent statistics showing decelerating wages and accelerating productivity. 

  Adding to the picture of a bustling economy was a new weekly report on unemployment claims. It showed that for the week ended Nov. 6, initial claims were down 6,000 to 285,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis.

  That's the principal finding of this year's edition of the Index of Economic Freedom, jointly published by the Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal. Of the 161 countries rated, many more (57) expanded economic freedom during the past year than curtailed it (34). 

  If this trend continues, the world-wide growth in economic freedom will be measured by the increase in prosperity of more and more of the world's people. In future centuries, people may come to marvel over the concept of ""poverty"" and how some governments relegated their citizens to that awful state when they might instead have lifted them into prosperity. 

  But for now, poverty is still with us. Despite the gains recorded in this year's Index of Economic Freedom, the bad news is that a majority of the world's economies remain unfree. Overall, the economies of 73 countries are rated this year as ""free"" or ""mostly free,"" while 88 earned ratings of ""mostly unfree"" or ""repressed."" The freest economies are concentrated in North America and Europe, while a majority of the repressed economies are in Asia and Africa. Latin America showed the most improvement. 

  The Index of Economic Freedom is now in its sixth edition. Every year we rank the world's economies according to 50 economic variables in 10 broad categories: banking, capital flows and foreign investment, monetary policy, fiscal burden of government, trade policy, wages and prices, government intervention in the economy, property rights, regulation, and black markets. Each year the data point to the same important conclusion: Countries with the most economic freedom also have higher rates of long-term economic growth; their people are better off, at all income levels. 

  Here, region by region, are the principal findings of the 2000 Index of Economic Freedom: 

  North America and Europe 

  This remains the most economically free region in the world, containing five of the 10 freest countries. Nineteen countries achieved better scores than last year, while only five saw their scores worsen. 

  The dominant trend this year is the improvement in monetary-policy scores: 10 of the 43 countries saw their ratings go up. In fact, this region can generally be characterized by its low inflation: half of the countries in Europe and North America have inflation rates below 6%. 

  The reasons for overall progress in economic freedom are threefold: First, some formerly communist countries have enacted policies that have yielded remarkable achievements since they gained their independence. Estonia (No. 22), Hungary (41), and Armenia (84) illustrate the economic success that can come from free-market policies: Armenia's real gross domestic product has averaged 5.7% growth since 1994, while Estonia has grown by 4.2% and Hungary by 3.3%. 

  Second, present-day Europe bears the marks of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set strict monetary and fiscal disciplinary requirements for would-be member states of the European Monetary Union. This commitment to the economic union presented a policy challenge to signatories. Some nations have struggled to meet the Maastricht requirements or have barely tried to adhere to them, while others, such as Luxembourg (No. 4), have seized the opportunity to enact structural reforms. All 11 countries in the EMU rate the highest possible monetary policy score of 1. Nonetheless, many of these countries continue to struggle with a high fiscal burden of government. 

  The third thread evident in Europe and North America this year is the success of the Anglo-American pattern of capitalism in promoting economic freedom. While mainland Europe tends, in broad terms, to adhere to market socialism, the United Kingdom (No. 8), Ireland (7) and other countries with British roots such as the U.S. (4) and Canada (11) follow a more capitalist approach to economic policy. While not the only valid route, Anglo-American capitalism by and large has led to a high level of economic freedom, as this year's index indicates. 

  Latin America and the Caribbean 

  For the second year in a row, this region made the greatest overall progress toward economic freedom. Of the 26 countries graded, 13 improved and only three worsened. The dominant story in this region is the number of countries that are controlling inflation; one-third received better monetary policy scores. 

  Chile and El Salvador (tied at No. 11) are the freest economies in the region, followed by Argentina (17), the Bahamas (22), Trinidad and Tobago (31) and Panama (33). Argentina's improved score reflects the effects of deregulation and remarkably lower inflation rates over the past few years. Brazil's score (No. 110) worsened due to the financial crisis and the government's subsequent policies, which resulted in higher taxes and increased government expenditures. The fate of the Brazilian government's economic reform program, enacted in response to the crisis, is in question, leaving the future of economic freedom in Latin America's largest country in doubt. 

  In Central and South America, economic freedom rose in Chile, El Salvador, Argentina, Barbados (No. 37), Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica (37), Uruguay (37), Bolivia (44), Belize (53), Costa Rica (58), the Dominican Republic (61), Honduras (99) and Cuba (157). Guatemala (46), Ecuador (84) and Brazil regressed. The rest remained the same. 

  North Africa and the Middle East 

  Economic freedom improved in this region as well. Of the 18 countries graded, seven improved their scores and two worsened. The improvements were largely a result of lower inflation rates and less government intervention in the economy. Bahrain (No. 4) is the economically freest country in the region. Its high score is chiefly the result of a lack of taxation on personal income and corporate profits. Bahrain also has one of the world's lowest levels of inflation, as well as a strong and efficient court system that upholds the rule of law. 

  The United Arab Emirates (No. 19) has the second freest economy, followed by Kuwait (37), Israel (49), Morocco (49), Oman (53), and Jordan (61). Other mostly unfree countries are Tunisia (74), Qatar (81), Lebanon (90), Algeria (108) and Egypt (110). Yemen (134), Syria (139), Iran (134), Iraq (160), and Libya (159) have unfree economies. 

  Sub-Saharan Africa 

  Sub-Saharan Africa remains the least free -- and by far the poorest -- area in the world. Of the 42 countries graded, none received a free rating. Only seven received a rating of mostly free, 28 were rated mostly unfree, and seven were rated repressed. Overall, 13 countries improved their scores this year while 15 nations saw their scores decline. 

  On a per capita basis, many sub-Saharan African countries are among those receiving the highest levels of economic assistance in the world. The index demonstrates that sub-Saharan Africa's poverty isn't the result of insufficient levels of foreign aid; rather, the main cause of poverty is the lack of economic freedom embodied in policies these countries have imposed on themselves, and the rampant corruption systemic there. 

  Asia and the Pacific 

  The Asian financial crisis has had a profound effect on the region. Countries that just a few years ago uniformly prospered now have gone in different directions due to policies pursued in reaction to the crisis. It's fair to say that for analytical purposes Asia as a whole no longer exists as a cohesive entity; it has fractured into subgroups of the economically free and unfree. Three of the four freest economies in the world are in Asia -- but so are eight of the world's 24 repressed economies. 

  Regionwide, five countries earned better scores this year but nine received worse ones, an overall regional decline in economic freedom. The decline was largely due to two factors: more government intervention in the economy and higher inflation. Taiwan (No. 11), Japan (19), South Korea (33), Thailand (46) and Indonesia (110) all declined, still reeling from the after-effects of policies enacted in the wake of the financial crisis. China's score (No. 100) rose due to significant improvement in inflation rates, but it still remains one of the most economically unfree countries in the world. 

  New Zealand (No. 3) and Australia (8), two of the brightest spots, represent the new, divergent Pacific region. Like other former British colonies that have adopted the Anglo-American capitalist model, they have experienced the success that comes from establishing an institutional backdrop for economic freedom -- such as the rule of law. This helped them weather the Asian financial crisis. 

  Hong Kong and Singapore still rank first and second, as they have in every past index. The editors of last year's index warned that Hong Kong might forfeit its top spot because of the government's intervention in the stock market in August 1998, but this year the government announced a plan to sell off its holdings. Singapore, which remains a close second, saw its score decline this year due to an increase in the marginal tax rate paid by the average taxpayer. 

  The fact that Hong Kong and Singapore have long ranked at the top of the index is testimony not only to their overall good policies, but also to the greater policy errors of other governments. Happily for the peoples of the world, more and more governments are adopting policies that promote economic freedom and long-run economic growth. Competition for the top rungs in the index ranking is increasing. 

  We look forward to chronicling this healthy competition to be the world's freest economy as we enter the 21st century.

174,"WSJ(11/15): REPEAT: `Emerging&apos; Bonds Rally Much Sooner Than Expected

 
  By Pamela Druckerman 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  NEW YORK -- The rally that was expected to sweep emerging-market bonds early next year has happened ahead of schedule. 

  Several months ago, conventional wisdom on Wall Street was that emergingmarket bonds wouldn't come into favor until 2000, once fears about potential computer glitches had passed. But on Friday, the main emerging-markets index hit its strongest level in 15 months, capping a 6.7% total return since the beginning of October and the index's strongest year-to-date performance in three years. 

  ""I think the first-quarter rally is beginning to happen right now,"" says Joyce Chang, head of global bond research at Chase Securities Inc. 

  The jump reflects a rosier economic outlook for emerging markets and the perception that governments and big companies are reasonably well prepared to stave off year-2000 problems. Developing Asian countries are expected to see about 5.7% growth in gross domestic product this year and next, thanks partly to an economic uptick in Japan and the rebound in global-commodity prices. Russia, whose bonds have seen the sharpest gains this year, appears to be moving toward a long-awaited domestic-debt restructuring and the release of additional money from the International Monetary Fund. 

  And Latin America, whose government bonds comprise the bulk of J.P. Morgan's EMBI+ index, sidestepped the potentially nasty consequences of Brazil's sharp currency devaluation earlier this year. Although the region's major markets should contract slightly in 1999, they are expected to grow as much as 4% in 2000. 

  ""Most of the big macroeconomic blowups have already happened,"" says Peter Petas, chief emerging-markets debt strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. He says debt from weaker-credit countries such as Algeria and Nigeria has already begun to draw interest as overall confidence in emerging markets grows. 

  So far, emerging-market bonds have mostly attracted investors who specialize in the asset class, although traders say they are getting inquiries, and some orders, from nonspecialists drawn to the high yields. However, trading volume remains low. In the third quarter, emerging-market bond trading was 48% below levels of the same period in 1998, according to the Emerging Markets Traders Association, an industry group. Brazil, Argentina and Mexico accounted for more than two-thirds of all trading, EMTA reported. 

  If interest from the generalist investors turns into more than a nibble, the bonds could rally even more. David Sekiguchi, head of Latin American debt strategy at J.P. Morgan & Co., said interest rates on some emerging-market bonds will fall 2.7 percentage points by the end of next year, a sign of improved confidence. When investors assess the markets at year end, he expects them to recognize that developing-country debt outperformed every other major category of bonds, as well as many equity markets. 

  There is also hope that the rally in government bonds will spill into other emerging-market securities. Ms. Chang says Mexican corporate bonds, which yield three to five percentage points more than the country's sovereign debt, could be next in line for a price surge, as investors take more risks in search of higher yields. She is keen on companies with strong trade ties to the U.S., which she says have been overlooked due to general trepidation about the developing world. 

  It could also spread to better-rated countries that have been left behind by the rally, often because their bonds are less liquid. Ms. Chang says debt from smaller countries such as Colombia, Panama and Peru, which are better rated than Argentina and Brazil, should be destinations for ""crossover"" buyers, although they are inherently limited by the small amount of bonds outstanding.

175,"WSJ(11/15): Romania Faces Tough Decisions Over Economy

 
  By Cristi Cretzan 
  Dow Jones Newswires 

  BUCHAREST -- The Romanian government faces an almost impossible task: balancing mounting protests from workers over the sharp deterioration in living standards with demands for budgetary discipline from international lenders. 

  As the government undertakes increasingly desperate attempts to revive its ailing economy, market observers say the International Monetary Fund should step in to help. 

  ""The IMF must do something if they want to maintain relations with this government,"" said Matthew Vogel, senior economist at Merrill Lynch International Ltd. in London. 

  Social pressures are rising as austerity measures have resulted in a dramatic drop in living standards. 

  In the past week, workers at truckmaker Roman SA stormed a local government building in the city of Brasov, railway workers blocked trains for hours in the capital's main rail station and steelworkers blocked a major road in northeastern Romania. Students took to the streets and declared strikes to demand higher grants. 

  ""It is normal to have these protests as the government must do so much in so little time,"" said Sonja Gibbs, a London-based economist at Nomura International. 

  The IMF has taken a first step toward releasing more funds to Romania by agreeing to ease the requirement that Romania has to raise $470 million from the private sector before a second tranche of a $547 million standby loan is released. 

  Although no new amount was set, National Bank of Romania officials hope a loan of about $100 million, underwritten by foreign banks active in Romania, will be enough to satisfy the IMF board. 

  ""We will have details on the loan in a few days and we will have this condition fulfilled,"" central bank chief economist Valentin Lazea said. 

  The release of the $200 million second tranche would trigger the release of loans worth $500 million from the World Bank and European Union. 

  But budgetary concerns remain for the IMF, particularly after the government of Prime Minister Radu Vasile approved a pay raise for army and police and fuel subsidies for the agricultural sector. 

  The IMF has asked for clarification on the measures, although government officials claim they won't affect this year's budget. The budget deficit is still seen at 3.9% of gross domestic product, as agreed with the IMF. 

  The government has tried to defuse tensions by offering other kinds of compensation than money, although this could trigger more criticism from the IMF. 

  At debt-ridden Roman, the government decided to offset part of the company's government debts by taking delivery of 420 trucks for the army and police. It also exempted Roman from paying duties on imported spare parts in 2000. 

  Romania is scheduled to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in the fall of 2000, and the opposition leftist Social Democracy party, together with ex-President Ion Iliescu, a former communist leader, enjoy a comfortable lead in opinion polls. 

  Merril Lynch's Mr. Vogel argues that the IMF should continue to encourage the government even if it doesn't immediately release the second tranche. 

  ""It is necessary to show that they believe in the [government's] program,"" he said. ""They must come back in Bucharest and work on the 2000 budget."" 

  However, Mr. Vogel said Romania should qualify for the tranche considering its good work this year. Foreign-exchange reserves at the central bank stood at $1.56 billion at the end of October, after falling below $800 million in June. 

  The current account deficit should be halved this year to $1.5 billion from $3 billion in 1998, helped by the gradual depreciation of the leu. The Romanian currency is expected to depreciate in real terms by 10% to 15% this year. 

  Still, the government will fail to meet its inflation target of 40.6% as agreed to with the IMF. But the central bank's Mr. Lazea said this will have little impact on the IMF's decision. He said Romania will work to keep the year-on-year inflation rate at the end of 1999 at below 50%, meaning a monthly inflation rate of about 2% in the remaining two months of 1999.

176,"WSJ(12/27): McTeer Joined Others In Vote On Fed-Funds Target

 
  By John D. McKinnon 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Evidence of inflation might still be scant, but the risk in November was enough to convince even the most reluctant Federal Reserve policy maker of the need to raise rates. 

  According to minutes of their Nov. 16 meeting -- which were released Thursday after the customary delay -- Robert McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, voted with all other Fed policy makers to increase the target for federal funds by a quarter point to 5.5%. Mr. McTeer had cast the sole vote against two previous rate increases, in June and August, based on his desire to test the economy's growth limits. 

  This time, according to the minutes, Mr. McTeer joined other policy makers who worried that the red-hot economy's increasing demand for workers could force labor costs to rise, while some of the factors that had held down other costs -- such as low energy prices and low demand overseas -- were turning around. 

  ""On balance . . . the unsustainable pace of economic expansion along with the reversal of factors that previously had held down overall price increases suggested a significant risk that inflation would strengthen over time given prevailing financial conditions,"" the minutes say. 

  Against that background, all the members supported ""a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy""the minutes say. 

  The officials also expressed ""broad agreement"" on ""tentative recommendations"" to change post-meeting statements of the policy-making committee concerning its ""bias"" on the direction of interest rates, though the minutes don't mention any specific proposals. The Fed has been issuing such statements since May, but critics say they're confusing. Fed policy makers are expected to clarify their procedures regarding the statements before their next meeting in February.

177,"WSJ(12/13): US Wholesale Prices Tame In November

 
  By Sarah Lueck 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Wholesale prices rose moderately last month, despite a sharp jump in energy prices, further evidence that inflation pressures remain tame. 

  The producer-price index rose 0.2% in November compared with the previous month, the Labor Department said Friday. But energy prices climbed 1.8%. Food prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.1%. Overall producer prices jumped 2.7% compared with November 1998. 

  The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was flat for the month. Since the core rate is often what economists examine when trying to predict the scope of price pressures, they took Friday's report as another sign that Federal Reserve policy makers won't raise interest rates when they meet Dec. 21. 

  ""It will suggest to officials that although inflation risks are on the high side, we have not seen any stirring yet on that front,"" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. 

  Even before Friday's report was released, analysts had predicted that Fed officials would be reluctant to raise interest rates this month because of concerns about possible Y2K-related glitches. ""The Fed probably prefers to stay on the sidelines,"" said Jeffrey Palma, economist at Warburg Dillon Read, Stamford, Conn. But Fed officials may switch their so-called bias -- their declaration of which way they are leaning on interest-rate policy -- toward tightening, he said. 

  Mr. Palma also said Fed policy makers will give more weight to upcoming reports on retail sales and consumer prices than to Friday's producer-price data. ""So far, consumer and producer prices have been very well behaved,"" he said. 

  Many finished goods that caused concern in the October report showed smaller increases in November. Prices for passenger cars, for example, rose 0.2% after a 1.1% increase in October. Prescription drugs, light trucks and household furniture all fell in November after rising the previous month. Durable manufacturing materials rose 0.2% last month after a 0.6% increase the previous month. 

  For all the good news, the new report contained some evidence of price pressure. Prices of intermediate goods rose 0.3% for the third month in a row, while crude-goods prices rose 4% after falling 1.6% the previous month. 

  As for energy prices, intermediate energy goods rose 1.8% in November, after increasing just 0.2% in October. Crude energy materials shot up 8.8% last month, after falling 4.8% the previous month. Electric power rose 0.7% and liquefied petroleum gas jumped 2.3%. 

  Even when the more volatile sectors are excluded, producer prices are inching up. The core rate of inflation for finished goods was up 1.9% for the 12 months ended in November, compared with an increase of 1.7% for the 12 months ended in October. Among finished-goods prices, eggs rose 22% last month following a 16.3% drop in October. Passenger-car radial tires rose 3.6% in November after a 2.5% decline the previous month. 

  Mr. Moran sees higher inflation on the horizon. ""You're seeing some important changes take place-foreign economies are improving, which will lift demand all over the world,"" he said. ""You could see the inflation rate in the U.S. creep higher."" 

  Meanwhile, although consumers remain positive about the economy, their enthusiasm appears to be slipping from recent highs. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment decreased to 104.2 in November from 107.2 the previous month. The mid-December index for consumer expectations declined to 100.2 from 101.0 in November.

178,"Politics, Not Econ, May Still Occupy Venezuela&apos;s Chavez

 

  By Charles Roth 

  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Now that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is armed with a new constitution that enhances his powers and enables him to serve up to 12 more years, local business leaders hope he'll turn his attention to economics. 

  And while the vast majority in the business community say the new constitution is laden with costly social guarantees and raises the state's already heavy presence in the economy, they're still holding out hope for the drafting of market-friendly laws and amendments. 

  Despite the possibility of a fiscal stimulus package in early 2000 to give at least a temporary boost to the sagging economy, however, politics may continue to dominate Chavez's agenda well into the new year. 

  The new constitution approved Wednesday opens the door to new elections for practically all public offices beginning as early as February. As a result, the president may soon start yet another round of campaigning - not just for the presidency, but for his coalition members who aim to land seats in federal and state legislatures, governorships and municipalities. 

  At the same time, Venezuela's economic problems are severe. Despite a tripling in the price of its oil basket from year lows in the first quarter, some believe the petroleum-rich country's economy will still contract 5% to 7% this year. 

  Unemployment stands at 20%. But the figure actually masks just how dire the country's labor situation really is: Only 36% of Venezuela's labor force is fully employed with benefits, according to Cenda, a labor market research house. 

  ""It's not possible to wait any longer to confront such problems,"" Domingo Maza, a central bank director, told Dow Jones Newswires. 

  Fiscal Faucets Seen Flowing Ahead Of Elections 

  While by no means a long-term solution, a quick-fix may be in the offing. 

  Thanks to oil, and the revenues it generates for the government, analysts reckon the Chavez administration has the resources to stimulate the economy. And with elections ahead, it also has the incentive. 

  Government officials project economic growth of 2.2% next year. Luis Vicente Leon, a director at Datanalisis, an economic and social polling firm, says growth will be higher, perhaps even 4%. 

  Leon is convinced that the government will open the fiscal faucet ahead of the elections to kick-start the economy, so that Chavez and his coalition allies will be able to bank on the improved sentiment that increased cash flow usually produces. 

  But analysts and business leaders alike say an intravenous money line for public works isn't enough to revive the ailing economy. Sustained growth, they argue, can only come if the private sector is permitted to flourish. For that to happen, the laws needed to apply the new constitution will have to provide a solid margin for the private sector to operate, they say. 

  While the private sector had its objections to the new constitution, it now has hopes that future legislators will also promote ""the important role of the private sector recognized in the constitution,"" said Pedro Carmona, vice-president of Fedecamaras, the country's largest business chamber. 

  Fedecamaras and other business chambers are urging the drafting of laws to mitigate articles relating to high severance pay, restrictive labor laws, a stiff tributary regime and a pervasive presence of the state as participant, planner and regulator in a slew of economic sectors. 

  The new constitutional articles relating to social security and education are meanwhile phrased to suggest that the state assumes full and exclusive responsibility, with even non-contributors to social security being guaranteed benefits. 

  Economists point out the state-run social security system is already effectively bankrupt and public health services notoriously poor. They say the added costs of honoring all the social guarantees in the new constitution could rise to 30% of gross domestic product over the next few years - outlays they maintain the government can't begin to afford. 

  Central Bank Hopes For Legally Defined Autonomy 

  Leading proponents of the constitution, including constitutional assembly President Luis Miquilena and Alfredo Pena, the head of the assembly's economic commission, have already said amendments can be made. 

  On Tuesday Chavez told foreign reporters that the constitutional guarantees wouldn't be applied overnight, and that employers and employees would have to join the state in making the new social and labor systems work. 

  Yet hopes for legislative changes aren't limited to the private sector. Maza said the central bank is also hoping for modifications. 

  For instance, while one constitutional article provides for the bank's autonomy, another stipulates that it must coordinate its monetary policy with the Treasury's fiscal policy. The constitution also requires the legislature to approve not only central bank directors but also its budget. 

  ""We hope the Central Bank Law, to be drafted within a year, will correct the inappropriate aspects (of the constitution) which could affect the bank's autonomy and monetary policy,"" said the bank's Maza. 

  That autonomy, he added, ""is fundamental in the fight against inflation."" 

  Social Program Can't Advance Without Economic Growth 

  But broadly speaking, Maza said he's optimistic that with the vote on the new constitution over, the country's political and economic paralysis should end. 

  ""The political panorama is clearing in good measure,"" he said. ""So now the economic action of the government will have priority."" 

  He added that upcoming political campaigns will have a ""different tonality"" than the one preceding the vote on the constitution. ""There is now a national consensus as to the necessity to reactivate the economy,"" he said. 

  In Maza's view, at least, that consensus supercedes the elections. Thus when financial markets reopen Friday after having stayed closed Thursday because of massive flooding in several parts of the country, he expects improved performance in both the bourse and the country's debt. 

  In New York Thursday, Venezuelan Brady bonds had a muted reaction to the passing of the constitution. The country's DCB bonds were up 1/4 to 79 bid in late activity, while bonds maturing in 2027 were off 1/8 to 65 7/16 bid. 

  Fedecamaras' Carmona wouldn't speculate on how local financial markets might react to Wednesday's vote. But most dealers and analysts say Venezuelan asset values should rise in the short term, now that the country's political and institutional framework has been in large part defined. 

  In the long term, however, financial markets will reflect performance in the broader economy. And that will depend, analysts say, on how much of a role the private sector is ultimately allowed to play. 

  Without a vibrant economy, they add, Chavez's ""peaceful revolution"" could quickly lose steam.

179,"WSJ(12/14): Unsung Officials Get Credit For Savvy Bond Sales

 
  By Gregory Zuckerman 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  At a family gathering this year, Sean Lannan was asked by his wife's cousin what he did for a living. Mr. Lannan, who works for telecommunications giant Lucent Technologies Inc., answered with pride: ""I'm the director of capital markets at Lucent."" 

  Uncomfortable silence. Blank stares. The conversation quickly shifted to the weather. ""People always think the title sounds important, but they don't know what I actually do,"" says Mr. Lannan. 

  Mr. Lannan and other executives who decide when companies should sell bonds to investors, and how much they should sell, will never be the life of the party in the real world. But in corporate America, and to an extent on Wall Street, they're increasingly getting respect. 

  That's because the bond market has been as tough on the nerves as a fourth cup of coffee, and executives who guessed right and sold a ton of bonds at just the right time saved their companies hundreds of millions of dollars. 

  Consider AT&T Corp.'s decision in March to sell $8 billion of bonds, shattering the record for the biggest bond deal on record. Some on Wall Street questioned the wisdom of raising so much money then, after interest rates had already moved higher. But rates have continued to climb, and the move now looks like a savvy one: If AT&T were to sell the same amount of bonds today it would have to pay $86 million a year more in interest payments over the next 30 years, a whopping $680 million in today's dollars. 

  Lucent itself sold $1.4 billion of bonds at a yield of 6.50% in March, after Mr. Lannan's team, together with Chief Financial Officer Don Pederson, determined that the economy would keep growing, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to keep inflation at bay. 

  The Fed proceeded to raise interest rates three times this year, and bond investors have gone through periods in which they fled from all kinds of bonds, including Lucent's. In fact, to get the same deal done today, the company would have to pay investors a yield of about 7.20% on its bonds, meaning Lucent saved about $11 million a year for the next 30 years, or about $138 million in today's dollars. 

  Treasurers, directors of capital markets and even chief financial officers often make these gutsy bets and can save their companies piles of money. But while chief executive officers get lots of credit for savvy strategic decisions, and many are even household names - think Michael Eisner, Bill Gates and John Welch - finance executives are often only recognized within their own households. 

  ""It's not as bad as being a proctologist, but it's right up there,"" says Mr. Pederson of Lucent. Capital-raising is ""taken for granted if it's done well, but if we screw up everyone knows about it."" 

  To be sure, a growing number of chief financial officers have made a name for themselves and gone on to high-profile jobs heading or helping to run companies. Douglas Ivester was the CFO of Coca-Cola Co. before eventually becoming chief executive. Jerome York was the chief financial officer of Chrysler Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. before leaving to become vice chairman of Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. 

  And thanks in part to savvy financing moves, Daniel E. Somers, AT&T's chief financial officer at the time of its bond deal, last week was named president and chief executive of AT&T Broadband & Internet Services, which manages the company's cable initiatives. Some even see him as a possible successor of AT&T Chairman Michael Armstrong. 

  To executives charged with running capital-raising efforts, the stakes are high. ""I live and die on these decisions,"" Mr. Somers said in an interview earlier this year, noting that his boss, Mr. Armstrong, encouraged AT&T's decision to jump into the bond market. 

  Roy Guthrie, chief financial officer at Associates First Capital Corp., says: ""In my chair, you sweat"" having to decide when to issue bonds and how much to sell. 

  Mr. Guthrie should know. He says some investment bankers second-guessed Associates' decision to sell $7.3 billion of fixed-rate bonds between October 1998 and June of this year. But the company has saved $77 million a year over 20 years, $383 million in today's dollars, by acting before rates jumped and investors turned lukewarm to corporate bonds. 

  ""Many companies got caught by paying up for financing in the third quarter but we didn't have to,"" he says. 

  Companies with heavy financing needs that go to the bond market regularly don't have the luxury of timing the bond market. They usually pay Wall Street firms to swap their interest-rate payments for floating-rate payments that move with interest rates. But companies without pressing needs can be choosier. Finance executives like Mr. Lannan gather intelligence on the future of rates, polling investors, Wall Street traders and analysts, with the goal of getting to the bond market when bonds are selling like hotcakes, and yields are low, rather than hot potatoes. 

  ""We're involved in various parts of the economy so we have a view"" of the future of interest rates, says Scott McCarthy, senior vice president of capital markets at Associates. 

  The task is crucial, Wall Street analysts say. The stock market tends to focus on high-profile acquisitions and new-product announcements, says Blake Bath of Lehman Brothers, ""but AT&T can save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of its bond issue and people don't appreciate that."" 

  So what should companies eager to raise money do now? Head for the bond market, say top financing executives. The economy shows few signs of slowing and the Fed may have to raise rates several times next year to keep inflation under wraps. Unless you can wait until the economy slows, perhaps during the second half of the year, sell your bonds now. 

  ""Rates are heading higher and we see several more Fed [rate increases] in the cards,"" says Mr. Lannan of Lucent. ""There's good demand from investors right now"" so companies should sell bonds now, rather than later. 

  Adds Mr. Guthrie of Associates: ""Pricing power will manifest itself in inflationary biases"" in the next year, forcing the Fed to raise interest rates and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond above 6.50%. 

  Associates is set to follow its own advice. ""We're going to be pretty aggressive out of the gate in year 2000 about raising money,"" says Mr. Guthrie.

181,"WSJ(1/18): Defying West, OPEC Cuts Output 5.6%

 
  By Bhushan Bahree and Thaddeus Herrick 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  VIENNA -- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries moved to cut oil output by 1.5 million barrels a day, or 5.6%, after a last-minute move by some members seeking a bigger reduction failed. 

  Coming after four successive output increases in the span of a year, the cut underscores OPEC's determination to keep oil prices high, even at the risk of pushing the slowing U.S. economy closer to recession. 

  OPEC undertook what is widely seen as a sizable cut despite pleas for restraint from the U.S. and the European Union. Libya, Iraq and Iran, all price hawks on production matters, mounted a short-lived campaign for a cut of 1.7 million barrels a day. But Saudi Arabia, which accounts for nearly a third of OPEC output, prevailed. 

  Lower production quotas are intended to keep oil prices at about $30 a barrel for the U.S. benchmark, West Texas intermediate crude. But uncertainties in global oil markets, including how much oil Iraq actually exports in the next few months, mean OPEC's action is probably just the first of several output adjustments it will make this year. ""We may have to do more, or we may have to do less,"" said Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister. 

  Mr. Naimi and other OPEC ministers contend that the slowing U.S. economy, coupled with a downturn in demand that accompanies the end of the northern winter, will lead to a drop in demand by as much as three million barrels a day. That could mean another cut when OPEC meets here again on March 16. ""We were forced to cut at this meeting in order to avoid a price crash in the second quarter,"" said Ali Rodriguez, OPEC's secretary-general and a former Venezuelan oil minister. ""And we will cut by one million barrels a day in March if prices continue to fall."" 

  With the latest cut, OPEC output, excluding Iraq, will decline to 25.2 million barrels a day. Oil futures fell yesterday on the news of the cut. West Texas intermediate crude dropped 69 cents to $29.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

  Analysts say yesterday's meeting illustrates OPEC's willingness to make risky decisions to prevent a price collapse. ""If OPEC is going to take risks, it's going to take them on the upside rather than the downside,"" said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst at Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. 

  OPEC's success in managing markets hinges heavily on Iraqi oil exports, which have been disrupted since the beginning of December. Iraqi officials say their country will resume exports of as much as 2.4 million barrels a day by the end of January. In the meantime, the intermittent nature of Iraqi exports since December -- because of spats over sales terms with buyers and the United Nations, which regulates Iraqi oil exports -- has made it difficult to ascertain just how much oil Baghdad is pumping. 

  But many in the industry figure Iraq has been exporting fewer than 500,000 barrels a day on average. When Iraq resumes its full exports, it alone will more than offset the reduction that OPEC agreed to yesterday. 

  Should Iraq resume exports, the U.S. economy continue to slow and seasonal demand drop as expected, OPEC may in fact see a glut. Industry experts expect non-OPEC oil output -- the North Sea, the U.S., Latin America and elsewhere -- to meet demand growth this year. That would mean OPEC, which added 3.7 million barrels of oil a day in the past year, would almost certainly have to keep cutting production to keep prices up. 

  OPEC oil ministers say they won't allow prices to drop just to give a boost to the U.S. economy. In fact, OPEC ministers say higher oil prices are not contributing to the slowdown, even while industry experts argue the opposite. 

  ""Economies go up and down,"" said Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, oil minister for the United Arab Emirates. ""I don't think oil is responsible.""

182,"Cargill Halts Production At Corn Processing Plant

 
 

  FARGO, N.D. (AP)-Cargill Inc. (X.CRG) has stopped production temporarily at the ProGold corn processing plant north of Wahpeton, citing high natural gas prices and a seasonal drop in demand for corn sweeteners. 

  Plant general manager Richard ""Red"" Geurts said production would be shut down indefinitely until conditions improve. 

  Cargill's 126 ProGold employees will report to work on maintenance and training during the plant's idle period, Geurts said. He said processing could resume by spring, when bottlers produce more soft drinks and use more corn sweetener. 

  ""We'll know more in a few weeks,"" he said. 

  The plant stopped receiving corn Tuesday. It will take about six days for workers to process the corn already there, and the plant will keep delivering corn sweetener from its inventory to some customers, ""maybe even for the duration of the idle,"" Geurts said. 

  Cargill will continue to make lease payments to the plant's owners - Golden Growers Cooperative of Fargo, Wahpeton's Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative and Moorhead, Minn.-based American Crystal Sugar Co. 

  The $261 million plant had a rocky start, opening in 1996 just as market prices for its high-fructose corn syrup dropped sharply. A 10-year lease signed with Cargill the next year brought stability to ProGold's operation and allowed Golden Growers to post profits for the last two years. 

  Letters were mailed Tuesday to Golden Growers shareholders informing them of the decision to idle the plant, said Mark Dillon, executive vice president of the co-op. 

  Dillon said the decision to idle production would not affect income for Golden Growers and the plant's other owners. But that may not be the case for co-op members, who are committed to sell to the ProGold plant 49% of the corn it processes.

183,"Syria State Bk: Hard Currency Buys Up After Rate Loosened

 
 

  DAMASCUS (AP)--Days after Syria loosened its exchange rate, the state-run Commercial Bank of Syria said Saturday that purchases of hard currency had doubled. 

  ""Purchases of foreign currencies, which in the past have stood at $60,000 a day, have become $130,000 a day during the past three days,"" the bank's director general, Mahmoud Mithqal, said. 

  Mithqal predicted that the figure will soon be three to four times the old daily quantity. 

  Syria started issuing daily exchange rates Monday, basing them on the current rates in Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries. Previously, the government had set the U.S. dollar rate at 46 pounds (SYP) for buying and SYP46.5 for selling. 

  Mithqal said for the time being, the bank wouldn't sell dollars and other hard currencies at market prices to finance commercial dealings. However, it would make foreign currency available for personal needs such as paying for air tickets, medical treatment abroad and Muslim pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia. 

  Bureaus of change are banned in Syria, but clandestine moneychangers do exist and there is a black market. 

  Mithqal said change bureaus would be legalized, but he didn't give a date. 

  He said the government is keeping an eye on the black market and the official rate would vary so that citizens get a valid price. 

  He added the government would keep its rate of SYP46  to the dollar as this figure has been used in the budget. 

  He said the government aims to create a better climate for investment in Syria.

184,"Treasurys Rally Amid Falling Stocks, Bets On Lower Rates

 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Treasurys rallied Friday as investors continued to fret about a slowing economy, falling stocks and the state of credit. 

  The broad-based buying in the government bond market benefited shorter-dated securities the most. It drove the two-year note's yield to its lowest level since the beginning of January, 1999. 

  Traders reported the across-the-board buying also steepened the slope of the yield curve. The spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond stood at around 83 basis points by early afternoon, versus Thursday's closing spread of 67 basis points. 

  Bond prices are increasingly moving to price in much lower interest rates ahead, even after the Federal Reserve's surprise half-point cut in its overnight interest rate target to 6% earlier in the week, participants said. They are increasingly expecting the Fed to cut rates another half point when it meets in a two-day policy meeting ending on Jan. 31. 

  At 1:45 p.m. EST, the 10-year Treasury note stood at 105 31/32, up 18/32 to yield 4.96%. The 30-year Treasury rose 3/32 to 111 29/32, yielding 5.43%. 

  The five-year soared 20/32 to a 4.68% yield, while the two-year was up 10/32 to yield 4.61%. 

  ""The bond market is doing very well today"" as participants move the market to price for big interest rate cuts ahead, said Richard Gilhooly, market strategist with Paribas in New York. ""The theme is more of the same: equity market implosion and concern over the California power situation"" - and the chance that difficulties there will spill over into the rest of the economy, he said.

  South Korea's December 2000 crude import cost rose to $2.05 billion from December 1999's import cost of $1.82 billion, KNOC said. 

  A KNOC official said the steep rise in the crude import cost was due to higher crude oil prices compared with the December 1999 cost.

186,"WSJ(2/8): California Sheds Light On Regulation

 
  By David Wessel 

  MAYBE PEOPLE THINK better in the dark. When the lights went out in California, a lot more people understood that how electric utilities are regulated matters to how we live, work and play. 

  In the darkness, however, some people rushed to familiar ideological corners. 

  One corner says that only if prices go high enough for long enough will consumers use less electricity and investors build more power plants. Painfully high prices now, this argument goes, will allow California to live happily ever after as demand and supply meet at a lower price in the future, however distant. 

  The other corner says the California mess proves that the market doesn't work. Never mind that California hardly let market forces act unfettered. This camp looks longingly for restored government control. 

  Believing firmly in one or the other school can blind you to workable solutions. Two examples: 

  First, should the federal government set ceilings on wholesale electric rates in the West? The market camp says, ""No!"" Backed by the Bush administration, it argues that temporary controls inevitably become permanent and that controls always discourage new supply. All good arguments, but not the right answer in a half-regulated, half-unregulated market for electricity. 

  ""If the price goes to $100,000 a megawatt, is that going to increase the speed with which they build a new power plant in California?"" asks Paul Joskow, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology energy economist. Not likely. 

  Second, should customers have to pay more for electricity at those moments when it costs more to make or buy it? The reregulate camp says, ""No!"" Yet experience in other states shows that answer is wrong. 

  What happens in California will shape the way the rest of the U.S. approaches electricity regulation. If California gets much messier, any remaining political support for deregulating elsewhere will vanish. 

 

  THE CASE FOR MARKETS is strong: They are better than bureaucrats at getting goods to those who will make the best use of them because they are willing to pay the most. That insight may finally dawn on Sacramento politicians as they wrestle with the fundamental issue: California is short of power. 

  Electricity is hard to store; it is produced as needed. Customers want it instantly and without restriction; no busy signals allowed. And utilities need generating capacity to meet demand at the one moment of peak usage, the summer afternoon when everyone turns up his air conditioner. Utilities save the least-efficient plants for those peaks. 

  For more than 25 years, clever economists and clearheaded regulators have been urging utilities to charge lots more during peak hours so big business customers shift demand to other periods, when power is cheaper than average. The lower the peak, the less need for new power plants. 

  ""It's pretty much in everyone's interest,"" says Severin Borenstein, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley. He is pushing California to adopt this ""real-time pricing"" technique and sees a pinprick of light in the darkness. 

  Although the technology is available, few U.S. utilities have moved aggressively to real-time pricing. California has been especially reluctant. ""Under the old regulatory regime,"" Mr. Borenstein says, ""the more real-time pricing and reduction of demand on peak, the fewer generation facilities you got to build."" And utilities existed to build plants. 

 

  THAT DAY IS GONE. And the success of pioneering utilities is instructive. At 4 p.m. this afternoon, Southern Co.'s Georgia Power Co. will send 1,600 big customers 24 separate prices for each hour tomorrow. For very big, and very flexible, customers, it offers a new price every hour; at 10 a.m., it tells them what power will cost between 11 a.m. and noon. At crunch time, prices can be as much as 50 times normal. 

  ""At first, many customers say, `There's nothing I can do to change my consumption,' "" says Michael O'Sheasy, the utility's project-design manager. ""But after a while, the creativity is amazing."" 

  An insulation maker shifted production to a Wednesday-Sunday schedule. Grocers turned their freezers on extra cold before a peak period, and turned them off when power was pricey. A factory built inventory in anticipation of a price peak so it could turn off an energy-greedy machine during the expensive hours. Others used their own generators when Georgia Power's electricity was expensive. Georgia Power routinely sheds 800 megawatts of demand when prices get high -- a big deal for a utility with a 15,000-megawatt peak. 

  In the same spirit, Exelon Corp.'s ComEd unit pays big Chicago customers to voluntarily turn off the power at peak periods, much as airlines offer bribes to surrender seats on overbooked flights. The payment is linked to the price of power on the spot market. Other utilities have similar programs but don't offer big enough bribes or do enough marketing to lure substantial numbers of customers. When necessary, ComEd can shed 1,200 megawatts of demand, the output of a big nuclear plant. 

  While electricity was cheap, few top executives were interested in experimenting. New energy retailers were more interested in market share than managing demand. Old utilities were worried about the thinner profit margins that come with shifting risk from supplier to customer. 

  California changes everything.

  ISTANBUL (Dow Jones)--The rapid devaluation of the Turkish lira since its float Thursday is threatening to empty the shops. 

  Just two working days after its free float, the lira has lost 36% against the dollar, and many international companies have stopped supplying goods to local retailers until the currency stabilizes, and they can plan a sensible pricing policy. 

  ""We stopped shipping to the local chains,"" said the Istanbul executive of a major multinational fast-moving consumer goods company, who declined to be named. ""Supplying in this environment doesn't make sense."" Many international suppliers typically spend dollars on imports and are then paid in lira by local retailers 90 to 120 days after shipment. 

  ""There's too much risk of selling below cost and remaining exposed to the currency,"" said the executive, who predicted that the existing stocks in the supermarkets would last about two weeks. 

  On Saturday, famous retail chains at a mall in Istanbul were offering 30% to 50% discounts for cash purchasers. 

  ""We need to revise our pricing policy; maybe we'll issue monthly prices,"" another leading international company retail executive added. ""We did the same in Mexico during their crisis...But first the dust needs to settle before we can see ahead."" He also declined to be named. 

  The dust is far from settling. The Turkish government still has to come up with a plan to support the currency. Sunday, Tunca Toskay, state minister in charge of foreign trade, predicted a ""fair"" exchange rate of TRL850,000 to a dollar, but that view isn't shared by the markets, even with the International Monetary Fund in town to help the government. Interbank rates Friday were around TRL1,250,000. 

  So far the casualties of the crisis have been restricted to monetary officials and Central Bank governor Gazi Ercel, who has already resigned. The markets are waiting to see if there will be political scalps, too. 

  Oil companies, which don't want to shoulder the political risk of locking the country out with a fuel shortage, have been extending credit to retailers, however. 

  ""We are continuing to supply fuel to the stations,"" said an executive of an oil major, who also asked for anonymity. ""We're selling at the pre-crisis prices."" 

  Another food retail executive said: ""Next week is crucial, as it will give us a sense on how things may develop."" 

  From March 2 through March 12, Turkey enjoys a long religious holiday. The government is expected to use that period to try and restore stability while the markets are closed.

188,"Ghana Raises Fuel Prices; 60% Hike In Gasoline

 
 

  ACCRA, Ghana (Dow Jones)--Ghana's government announced a 60% hike in gasoline prices in a bid to keep its debt-ridden national refinery from collapse. 

  Gasoline, which formerly sold for GHC6,400 a gallon, will now sell at GHC10,500 ($1=GHC7,000), Energy Minister Albert Kan-Dapaah said Friday. 

  Diesel fuel, which is commonly used throughout the country, will sell at GHC8,800, up from GHC6,000 a gallon, the minister said. 

  The increases took effect Friday. 

  Since taking office in January, President John Agyekum Kufuor has stated the need to raise fuel prices to save the Tema Oil refinery, which processes all of Ghana's crude oil imports. The refinery has accumulated nearly $350 million in debts, Finance Minister Yaw Osafo-Maafo said recently. 

  Despite the increase, fuel prices in Ghana remain the lowest in West Africa and the government is still subsidizing the cost of fuel, Kan-Dapaah said. Earlier this month Kufuor told parliament that the previous government spent GHC6 billion a day subsidizing petrol. 

  Ghana's economy has deteriorated badly over the past 18 months, as increases in world prices of oil, its main import, coincide with a sharp fall in international cocoa and gold prices, its two main exports. 

  The government alleges former President Jerry Rawlings delayed increasing fuel prices in order to win votes for his party in December elections. 

  Last week, Kufuor led a team to Abuja, Nigeria, to negotiate for fuel imports under a 90-day repayment agreement. 

  The country's main trade union body, the Trade Union Congress, warned Thursday that any price increases in fuel should be done gradually and should be accompanied by a raise in workers' salaries.

189,"Charting Europe: April IPE Brent Crude Capped At $29

 
 
   By Axel Rudolph, MSTA 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The charts are pointing to at least a short-term consolidation for the Brent crude price on the International Petroleum Exchange. 

  Currently trading at around $27.65, April Brent has been coming off its recent relative high at $29.15 and is probably going to retrace towards at least $26.50 within the next few days. 

  The combination of a loss in momentum, a bearish crossover in the highly overbought modified stochastic and a ""Bearish Engulfing"" pattern in a high probability trend-reversal time zone all indicate lower prices to come. 

  Following the rally from $22.90, Brent Crude came close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $29.42, taken from the all time high to December low. The fact that it only briefly traded above $29 without reaching the Fibonacci level and then closed below the $29 mark points to a spike reversal having formed. 

  Furthermore the ""Bearish Engulfing"" pattern on the daily Japanese Candlestick chart Friday, formed a day after the spike to $29.15, is a potential trend-reversal pattern. 

  For the time being no reversal of the medium-term trend is anticipated. 

  A correction towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracements of last year's October to December decline as well as of the current advance, at $26.92 and $26.76 respectively, are likely, however. 

  This price zone also encompasses the Dec. 11 and Dec. 12 highs, adding further support and making it a target on the chart. 

  Since Brent is still within its December and January uptrend channels, technical analysis favors the trend to continue and the market to simply correct to the lower boundaries of these channels. 

  They currently come in around $26.00 and $25.50. Only a daily close below the $25.50 major support zone, at $25.00 or lower, would reverse the current uptrend. 

  A consolidation is probable though, as the recent high has been made at a critical juncture in time from where at least short-term corrections to a trend have occurred in the past. 

  This time zone is where the duraction of the November to December 2000 bear move has been multiplied by 1.618 to provide the next possible high. 

  In the case of April Brent crude, the November to December decline lasted for 23 days. The recent high was formed after 37 days (1.618*23), taken from the Dec. 20 closing low. This time level coincides perfectly with the Feb. 8 high. 

  Furthermore the daily momentum has slowed over the past few days after having reached extreme levels from where recent corrections or trend-reversals have been made. 

  Also the %K and %D lines of the modified stochastic have just crossed in the highly overbought 80% zone and are now pointing down, further adding to a probable consolidation. 

  All relative highs since June 2000 have been made from the 75%-90% overbought zone in the modified stochastic. Therefore, the probability of another relative high having just taken place above $29 is high and a correction is in the making.

190,"UK Npower To Up Domestic Gas Bills By 4.5% From April 13

 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Npower, retail arm of the U.K.'s Innogy Holdings PLC (IOG), Friday said it will increase domestic gas prices by 4.5% from April 13 due to ""volatile market conditions."" 

  However, the company said new customers signing up for dual fuel before April 13 would be protected from rising gas prices until March 2003. 

  The company's decision follows similar price increases announced by the U.K.'s two largest suppliers Centrica PLC (U.CTR) and TXU Europe, a unit of TXU Corp. (TXU) of the U.S. 

  All companies attributed the retail price increases to price hikes of 80%-100% in the wholesale market in 2000. 

  The wholesale gas price rises came mostly on the back of increased gas flows through the U.K.-Continent Interconnector. 

  Under pressure from U.K. industrial users, whose bills have increased by up to 100% this year, the U.K. government and the European Union Commission have separately announced inquiries into the functioning of the wholesale gas market. 

  At 1410 GMT Friday, Innogy shares were trading at 204.5 pence, up 1.5 p from Thursday's close of 203 p.

191,"US Beef Prices Soar After Tough Winter, Drought

 
 

  WASHINGTON (AP)--Retail beef prices are soaring -reaching a record $3.21 a pound for USDA-choice cuts in January -because of a harsh Plains winter that has been tough on cattle. 

  Prices are likely to dip by the summer, but then rebound because of tight cattle supplies. Producers are only starting to rebuild herds that they thinned because of drought and low prices in the late 1990s. 

  The winter has been so cold and damp that cattle are taking several months longer than usual to fatten up. In bad weather, cattle in feedlots don't eat as much and use up energy staying warm. 

  ""We have basically had one of the harshest winters that we have seen in a very long time,"" said Chuck Levitt, a meat analyst with Chicago-based Alaron Trading Corp. ""The last time we had a winter this severe across the major cattle feeding areas was in 1993."" 

  The previous record for retail prices was in September, at $3.13 a pound. In the late 1990s, they were averaging about $2.80. 

  Live cattle are selling for 82 cents a pound, up from 78 cents last month and about 68 cents in February 2000. 

  ""We've definitely seen the beef prices go up big time,"" said Rickey Figueroa, executive chef of Atlanta's Chops Steakhouse. 

  The price the upscale restaurant is paying for beef tenderloin has gone from $15 to $20 a pound in recent weeks. So far, the restaurant isn't changing its menu prices, in hopes of negotiating better deals with another supplier, Figueroa said. 

  Americans have rediscovered a taste for beef at the same time that U.S. meat exports are up and many producers have been sending all of their calves to slaughter, rather than holding females back for breeding. 

  Experts say it's too early to assess the impact on U.S. prices and supplies from outbreaks of mad-cow and foot-and-mouth diseases in Europe. 

  Beef sales plummeted in the European Union after an upsurge of mad cow cases in several countries last year. Since October, beef prices in Europe have fallen by about 27%. 

  The European Union doesn't buy most U.S. beef because the cattle are treated with growth hormones. 

  In the United States, ""The prices are up because the stock of cattle in the country is way down,"" said Mark McLaughlin, who ranches near Sweetwater, Texas, in a region that has been through several years of drought. ""I bet in this area of Texas we've gotten down to 30%"" of normal herd sizes. 

  McLaughlin sent 450 calves to feedlots this winter so they could be fattened for slaughter. That's about half the cattle he was selling a few years ago when his herds were larger. Last fall, however, he kept some female calves so he could start rebuilding his herd over the next two years to take advantage of the higher prices. 

  U.S. cattle supplies are down 1% this year and 6% from a peak in 1996. 

  Beef consumption, meanwhile, reached 99.5 pounds per person last year, up from 98.7 per person the year before and 95.6 pounds in 1997. U.S. beef sales to Japan and other export markets rose 11% in 1999 and another 4% last year. 

  ""Demand is holding up very strongly,"" said Agriculture Department analyst Ron Gustafson. 

  Retail prices will likely moderate as the weather warms and more cattle head to slaughter, but then cattle supplies will tighten over the next two years as ranchers retain their female calves, rather than send them for slaughter, he said.

192,"Calif Assembly OKs Investigating Power Plant Outages

 
 

  SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)--The California Assembly took several steps Thursday to cope with California's energy crisis, passing bills that would regulate power plant outages and expand utility programs that cut rates for big power users who turn off electricity when needed. 

  A measure by Assemblywoman Carole Migden would give the overseer of the state power grid authority to coordinate plant outages to prevent too many from going off line for maintenance at any one time. 

  If a power plant seemed to have too many outages or was shut down for a suspicious length of time, the grid manager, the Independent System Operator, could investigate and the state Electricity Oversight Board could order fines. 

  ""We have suspected that in some instances these generators have shut down and this has not been in the public interest,"" said Migden, D-San Francisco, adding that she was not accusing anyone of wrongdoing. ""What we're trying to do is create an audit and accountability system."" 

  The bill largely puts into state law an executive order issued last month by Gov. Gray Davis and goes further by giving the Electricity Oversight Board the power to issue fines. The fines would be based on the cost of power the ISO had to buy as a result of a plant's shutdown. 

  Senate leader John Burton on Wednesday announced a Senate committee will investigate whether electricity wholesalers illegally withheld power to drive up prices. 

  He cited plant outages for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance that have contributed to supply shortfalls, forcing the ISO to scramble for power at premium prices to meet demand. 

  Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Reliant Energy (REI) will be among major providers included in the Senate inquiry, said Committee Chairman Joe Dunn. 

  Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers industry group, said wholesalers will cooperate, but warned that if it becomes a ""witch hunt"" it could discourage them from building plants in California. 

  A similar Assembly panel has been formed to look into natural gas prices. The probes could lead to action by the state attorney general. 

  The Federal Regulatory Energy Commission on Wednesday ordered Williams Cos. (WMB) unit Williams Energy Marketing & Trading and AES Corp. (AES) unit AES Southland to show why they should not be forced to refund $10.8 million to California utilities for taking generating units in Long Beach and Huntington Beach off line last April and May. 

  That follows a FERC order last week directing wholesalers to refund $69 million in California electricity charges or demonstrate why the charges were justified. FERC, a strong supporter of deregulation, has given the companies until March 23 to appeal that decision. 

  The Assembly approved Migden's plant outage bill 57-5 and sent it to the Senate. 

  The Assembly also sent the Senate two measures on investor-owned utilities' interruptible-service programs, which give non-residential utility customers discounted rates if they agree to shut down during periods of tight power supplies. Both votes were 67-0. 

  The programs are considered key tools for avoiding rolling blackouts this summer, when air conditioning and other power use is expected to further strap the state's electricity supply. 

  The Assembly approved a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, that would extend the programs until the end of 2002 and require investor-owned utilities to offer customers more ways to participate. 

  It also passed a measure by Assemblywoman Lynn Daucher, R-Brea, that would let those in such programs for at least a year that have been barred by the state Public Utilities Commission from getting out of them opt out without penalty. 

  Customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers found themselves shut down frequently in January. Several schools and businesses asked to be let out of the programs, saying they couldn't function due to the frequent outages. 

  The PUC on Thursday was expected to discuss a new plan for interruptible-service programs.

194,"WSJE: ECB Keeps Rates Steady On Concern About Inflation

 
  By G. Thomas Sims 
  Staff Reporter 

  FRANKFURT -- Unfazed by falling stock markets, the European Central Bank, as expected, left interest rates steady because the bank still detects some inflation risks. 

  The ECB didn't explain the decision taken at a regular policy meeting, but recent comments from officials indicate the ECB still fears workers may demand higher wages that could stoke inflation. The trickle-down effect on consumer prices from last year's oil-price increase and a weaker euro still concerns the ECB, as does increased government spending. 

  Unlike in the U.S., dramatic falls in European share prices have little bearing on the broader economy here. European firms don't rely as heavily on stock markets for financing. Stock market capitalization in Europe is only 66% of ouput, half the level of the U.S., according to ECB figures. 

  European households don't have that much money invested in the stock market either. German households' equity holdings, as a percentage of disposable income, are five times less than for U.S. households, a working paper for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says. A 20% fall in share prices would only knock 0.1 of a percentage point off output in Germany, France, and Italy - eight times less than the effect of such a stock fall in the U.S. 

  ""The macroeconomic impact of movements in the stock exchanges is much more limited indeed than in the U.S.,"" Wim Duisenberg, the ECB president, said last week. 

  The ECB has been the only major central bank in the world not to ease borrowing costs, with growth slowing nearly everywhere. Over the past two months, however, the ECB has admitted that inflation risks are deteriorating, but some caution is necessary and justifies a wait-and-see policy. This has caused economists to expect the ECB to cut interest rates in the second quarter of this year. 

  Inflation reports from France, Germany and Spain earlier this week suggest annual inflation quickened in February after a two-month slowdown to perhaps as much as 2.6%, well above the 2% maximum rate the ECB permits. The European Union issues the report Friday. Oil, meat and tobacco were behind the price increases in those countries. 

  Unlike the U.S. and Japan, the euro-zone economy is showing only moderate signs of slowing. The ECB expects growth to slow to just under 3% this year from about 3.4% last year. 

  Confirming views of a slowdown, Italian industrial production in January fell a seasonally adjusted 1.8% from December, according to government report Thursday.

195,"Calif To OK 20% Rate Hike For Utils -Commissioners

 
 

  (This article was originally published Saturday) 

 
   By Jason Leopold 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission will likely approve a 20% rate increase for two of the state's largest utilities Tuesday,  ending a three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Saturday. 

  The rate hike would let the state recoup money it spent buying power since January, said the commissioners, who asked not to be named. The increase also would let utilities start paying small independent power producers on a forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, the commissioners said. 

  PUC also may approve a trigger mechanism. The move would allow utilities PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison additional rate increases of 5%, if needed, to cover future power costs. Rates could go down if the future price of power stabilizes, the commissioners said. 

  A PUC administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed order that does not support the rate increase and end to the rate freeze. As a result, PUC Commission President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue an alternate proposal that will call for a rate increase of about 20%, the commissioners said. 

  Both proposed orders are expected to be issued Sunday afternoon. 

  ""There is just no way we can extract 10 cents from a nickel,"" said one Democratic commissioner, who asked not to be named. ""Unfortunately, we are going to have to grant the utilities an increase."" 

 

  SoCal Ed To Present Rate Arguments Monday 

 

  The commission is expected to hear oral arguments Monday by SoCal Ed executives regarding the company's rate stabilization plan. When first presented to the commission in November, the plan called for a 10% rate increase. PG&E also filed a rate stabilization plan at the time asking for a similar increase. 

  Both utilities argued last November that their costs exceeded their revenues because wholesale power prices spiked during the summer. The utilities' customers' rates were frozen, but wholesale prices continued to soar, surpassing the roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour and 6.5 cents/KWh rate the utilities were legally allowed to charge their customers. 

  In December, PG&E and SoCal Ed revised their rate stabilization plan, requesting rate increases of as much as 30% because wholesale power prices failed to stabilize and the utilities were getting deeper into debt. The commission denied the request in January and approved a temporary rate increase of 9% for residential consumers and 14% for large industrial customers. 

  PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their ratings downgraded to junk-status by Wall Street credit agencies and have defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank loans. 

  Gov. Gray Davis was in Palm Springs over the weekend for a fundraiser, and his staff was unavailable for comment. Representatives for PG&E and SoCal Ed were also unavailable for comment. 

  Earlier this month, Davis told Wall Street analysts that he would not allow a rate increase because he feared a ballot initiative by consumer advocates in the state, who would call for an end to the state's deregulation law. 

  ""Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in 20 minutes,"" Davis said at a March news conference. 

 

  Group Pledges 'Ratepayer Revolt' If Prices Rise 

 

  Harvey Rosenfield, executive director of consumer advocacy group The Foundation of Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, promised a ""ratepayer revolt"" and 2002 ballot initiative if electricity rates are increased. Consumer advocates are also expected to testify at Monday's hearing about why the utilities should not be permitted to raise consumer electricity rates. 

  Legislative sources said the rate increase is needed so the state Department of Water Resources, which in January started purchasing power for the cash-strapped utilities, can be repaid. Moreover, the utilities can begin paying the state's so-called qualifying facilities for electricity. PG&E and SoCal Ed have not paid the QFs in full since January, and the companies owe the generators about $1 billion. 

  In hindsight, one key Democratic state senator said, if the state allowed the utilities to raise rates in January, the DWR would not have had to spend nearly $4 billion from the general fund buying power. Further, said the senator, who asked not to be named, the state would not have had to negotiate a deal to buy the utilities' power lines in an effort to restore the companies to financial stability. 

  ""Think about it. PG&E and Edison could have regained access to loans and would have been able to restore their credit,"" the senator said. ""We ultimately spent more than $5 billion than we should have if a rate increase is approved. That's not counting, the billions of dollars more we spent and are going to spend on long-term contracts, transmission assets and revenue bonds. People are going to want answers and I don't know what we're going to tell them.""

196,"FERC Considers Cap On Calif Pwr Prices During Top Alerts

 
 

  WASHINGTON (AP)--Federal energy regulators are reviewing a proposal to restrict wholesale electricity prices in California during the severe power shortages expected this summer. 

  The proposal, which is to be taken up at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting Wednesday, also would require producers to sell power for California's grid during power emergencies. 

  The commission has faced growing political pressure to find new ways to address allegations of price gouging in the Western power markets, where wholesale costs have been ten times what they were a year ago, and likely will go higher in the coming months. 

  The agency, reflecting the views of its Republican chairman, Curtis Hebert, has refused repeated requests by West Coast officials to impose price caps on wholesale electricity sales in the West. 

  The staff proposal aims to avoid the term ""price caps"" and views the plan as limited ""price mitigation"" that would seek to blunt severe price increases but not threaten supplies, according to a staff summary. 

  The proposal ""recognizes that (power) scarcity ... will exist for the near term and that, during such periods, some extraordinary measures must be considered,"" said the summary provided to commissioners. 

  It proposes that price restrictions be limited to California and only at times of so-called Stage 3 emergencies, when electricity reserve margins virtually disappear, raising the prospects of rolling blackouts. 

  At the same time, the commission is expected to discuss a proposal to officially endorse plans where industrial power users curtail or close facilities and sell back electricity during severe shortages. 

  The commission has reviewed thousands of wholesale power transactions during the first three months of this year and has singled out $124.5 million in alleged overcharges. California officials say many times that amount should be recovered in refunds because of price gouging. A recent California report put alleged overcharges during the past year at more than $6.2 billion. 

  The new ""price mitigation"" plan is aimed at preventing the most severe price run-ups ahead of time, instead of having to seek refunds later, according to several of the commissioners. 

  But the staff proposal is short of what even some members of the commission have wanted, since it limits price intervention to only the most severe emergency periods. It also does not address escalating prices elsewhere in the West, particularly Washington and Oregon, where prices at times have been higher than in California. 

  While Hebert, the Republican commission chairman, has stood firm in his opposition to price controls, he has indicated he might go along with some very limited form of price mitigation if it can be shown not to inhibit producers from expanding power supplies. 

  At the same time, Linda Breathitt, one of two Democratic commissioners, has indicated in recent weeks that she is increasingly leaning toward some price intervention. 

  It is ""important that we place all options on the table for serious consideration,"" including some ""price mitigation plans,"" she said during a recent FERC meeting with state utility regulators from Western states. 

  The third commissioner, William Massey, also a Democrat, has all along argued for across-the-board price caps, based on cost of production, and said they should apply to all 11 states in the Western power grid. 

  The FERC has been operating with three commissioners and two vacant seats. President Bush has announced two nominees to fill the vacancies, but both still await Senate confirmation and are not likely to be on board before the summer's power crunch hits. 

  When the two nominees - Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, both state utility regulators - come up for confirmation, they are expected to be questioned sharply by Senate Democrats about their views on price controls and the free market. 

  Last week, Democratic Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Jean Carnahan of Missouri asked the General Accounting Office to investigate whether FERC has complied with its duties under the Federal Power Act to ensure that wholesale electricity prices in the West are fair and reasonable.

197,"Meat Byproduct Shortages Hit Array Of Goods In Europe

 
 

  FRANKFURT (AP)--Fruit chews pulled from store shelves in Poland. Price hikes for Italian shoes and French handbags. Animal fat abandoned by global makers of face cream and soap. 

  Europe's effort to rein in its bout of livestock disease isn't just hammering world supplies of lamb chops and prime rib. It's starting to hit the 40% of a cow, pig or sheep that never makes it to a store refrigerator shelf. 

  Consumers around the world may soon develop a newfound appreciation for these uneaten animal parts, which are skinned, ground up or melted down into ingredients used every day in a dizzying array of goods. 

  With fewer animals slaughtered in Europe due to fears of eating meat, hide prices are soaring. Shoppers could pay more for this summer's lineup of items like leather furniture, high-end car seats, clothing and shoes. 

  Costs also are rising for tallow, or animal fat, which is used in candles, soap and beauty products - though consumer prices appear unaffected for now as manufacturers absorb higher costs or use substitute ingredients. 

  European suppliers of meat byproducts, meanwhile, face millions of dollars in losses. 

  ""Our byproduct industry has taken a hammering,"" said Martin Grantley-Smith at Britain's Meat and Livestock Commission. ""In straight exports, Britain will be losing millions of dollars a year in terms of byproducts."" 

  British slaughterhouses used to get GBP5 per ton of byproduct material from companies eager to turn it into tallow, leather or bone meal. But with a host of new restrictions against using those parts, slaughterhouses are now having to pay up to GBP90.50 a ton to have it hauled away. 

  Bans imposed by nations around the world because of mad-cow and foot-and-mouth diseases have halted 94% of the European Union's beef exports and 73% of its pork exports. They also have slowed Europe's weekly livestock slaughter from a half million head to just 350,000 head, according to Hidenet.com, an Internet market report. 

  Restraints on using nonedible beef byproducts have been around since the mad-cow outbreak in the mid-1990s. But a mad-cow scare that peaked in the fall and the current food-and-mouth crisis have led countries to fortify or extend those laws. 

  Europe is trying to halt the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, which unlike mad-cow poses no human health threat, by incinerating the animals, hides, hooves, bones, fat and all. 

  Europe's mass culls have torpedoed the local supply of leather, by as much as 75% in Britain, and have lifted the price of local leather by about 20%. Worldwide, the supply squeeze has pushed up cowhide prices 15% in the last two months, Hidenet.com reported. 

  The market claimed its first U.S. victim last month when Irving Tanning Co., a small 390-employee firm in Hartland, Maine, filed for bankruptcy protection. 

  Irving Tanning doesn't buy European hides, but vice president Paul Larochelle said the company was pinched by a blitz of overseas demand for U.S. skins that pushed stateside prices up 66%. 

  ""You can only absorb so much before you have to turn around and say, 'Enough is enough,""' Larochelle said. 

  To counteract tight demand, the European Footwear Confederation has petitioned the E.U. to order member countries to remove pelts and skins before animals are destroyed. 

  But what's a crisis to one region is often an opportunity to another. 

  Increased European demand for leather is fueling a mini-boom in Brazil, where ranchers are boosting their 2001 export forecast to 1.83 billion reals ($1=BRL2.14) from an earlier prediction of BRL1.61 billion, says Jose Roberto Scarabel, president of the Brazilian Tannery Industries Center. 

  U.S. hide exports shot up 25% to $2 billion last year after the mad-cow scare struck, according to Leather Industries of America, another trade group. And January exports were 12% ahead of last January's. 

  In other byproduct markets, the impact is less direct. 

  About 12% of an animal is usually ground down and melted to make tallow. The animal fat is widely used in consumer and industrial goods despite a shift to substitutes in the mid-1990s by makers of cosmetics and other products seeking to address health concerns raised in earlier mad-cow scares. 

  But the current outbreak has forced countries such as Japan to institute full-fledged bans against animal products in such consumer goods. 

  That has ramifications in Europe for companies like Cognis, a Netherlands-based chemical company that makes raw ingredients for body care products as well as industrial lubricants. 

  Just a few years ago, it used animal tallow in nearly half of its cosmetics. Today, virtually none of its health care line uses animal products, although tallow still accounts for 20% of its industrial chemicals. 

  Cognis calculates it costs 10% more to make vegetable-based products. But the shift may be paying off, because tallow prices have spiked in the last month as European restrictions crimp supplies. 

  ""If foot-and-mouth disease lasts for one or two years, we could see a possible increase. But right now, it's really just a short-term phenomenon,"" said Albert Strube, one of the Cognis' top chemists. 

  At the same time, German cosmetics giant Welle AG, maker of Ultrasheen hair care products, has tripled its research budget to find plant-based alternatives to tallow - in part because consumers scrutinize ingredients more carefully than they used to. 

  Gelatin, derived from ground bone and cartilage, is a common ingredient in yogurt, soft cheese, medicine capsules and jelly. It's also used in candy, which it makes soft and chewy. Recently, the German makers of the Mamba fruit chew pulled them off supermarket shelves in Poland when customs officials said they posed a possible health risk. 

  British candy maker Cadbury hopes to avoid a similar fate by importing its gelatin from South America, where the mad-cow risk is lower. Kurt Bohlen, general manager of Leiner Davis Gelatin, Latin America's largest gelatin producer, expects Brazilian exports to jump 10% this year. 

  Meanwhile, German candy giant Haribo, inventor of the gummi bear, is taking a different tact. Just last month, it rolled out its first batch of gelatin-free gummi candies, a new product that gets around similar beef bans in countries like Malaysia and Singapore. 

  The situation could ease as foot-and-mouth disease comes under control. As the continent slowly turns the tide against the outbreak, E.U. agriculture ministers met this past week to discuss broadening limited immunization programs already authorized in the worst hit areas of Britain and the Netherlands. 

  A turn for the worse could be foot-and-mouth disease finally hitting U.S. shores. The last U.S. outbreak occurred in 1929, and the leather industry says it could prove disastrous for the nation's 98 million head of cattle. 

  ""If we get it here, heaven forbid, there's no telling where prices could settle,"" said Charles Myers, president of Leather Industries of America. ""I just hope and pray it doesn't come this way.""

198,"WSJ(4/3): Commodities: Crude-Oil Futures Slip To Yr Low Mon

 By Marie C. Sanchez 
  Dow Jones Newswires 

  NEW YORK -- Crude-oil futures started off the second quarter at the lowest price of the year. 

  May crude futures skidded 70 cents to $25.59 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. A flurry of late selling briefly sent the contract to its lowest level since May 2000. 

  ""There's a general oversupply of crude right now,"" said Ed Silliere, vice president of risk management at Energy Merchant, an energy-marketing firm. ""It's just the posture of the cash market. You call out for buyers, you get one or two. You call out for sellers, you get three or four."" 

  The steep decline in prices was a nod to conventional wisdom: The usual seasonal decline in oil demand during the second quarter is likely to be exaggerated by the slowing economy, causing a glut and sending oil prices crashing. 

  Crude-oil inventories have been climbing steadily during the past three weeks and added more than 11 million barrels during the latest week reported, according to a report last week by the Department of Energy. 

  Yesterday's retreat in the stock market also frayed nerves over the state of the economy. 

  Chris Schachte of brokerage firm GSC Energy said there is a general sense of an economic slowdown: ""In that environment, demand is going to ease. 

  ""We're waiting to see if the stock-market problems will affect the economy,"" he said. ""There are worries that demand will fall off the table if the economy gets bad."" 

  Yesterday's weak performance in crude oil sets the stage for further losses, perhaps to $24 a barrel, Mr. Schachte said. 

  Although refined-products futures plunged, with heating oil losing three cents and gasoline sliding two cents, it was crude oil that pressured the petroleum complex lower, analysts said. 

  ""This is the tail wagging the dog,"" Mr. Silliere said. 

  Analysts also said an article in The Wall Street Journal contributed to the pessimism with a report that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries isn't likely to live up to its promises to cut output. 

  OPEC has cut production quotas twice this year - by 1.5 million barrels a day in January and one million barrels last month - in an effort to keep the group's reference price basket of crudes near its target of $25 a barrel. 

  The latest output cut went into effect Sunday. However, OPEC was overproducing by 500,000 barrels a day in February, The Wall Street Journal reported, and analysts said it won't be long before OPEC members are cheating in earnest. 

  The OPEC basket price slipped to $22.79 a barrel Friday. To avert a price plunge in the second quarter, OPEC members have agreed informally to reduce production quotas by an added 500,000 barrels a day if the price basket stays below $22 a barrel for 10 consecutive trading days. 

  ""Even if OPEC production dropped by one million barrels a day over the weekend as previously announced, the market can still be confident of a supply surplus of roughly 1.5 million barrels a day [during the second quarter],"" said Tim Evans, analyst at IFR Pegasus, a research firm. 

  ""It's not going to hold the price here or move it higher,"" Mr. Evans said. 

  In other commodity markets: 

 

  HOGS: Prices soared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, fueled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's hogs-and-pigs report. The June contract rose by its two-cent limit to 71 cents a pound. The report, released after 4 p.m. Friday, showed that at 58.8 million head, the number of hogs and pigs in the U.S. on March 1 was up 2% from last year's figures, but 1% below Dec. 1, 2000. 

 

  GOLD: Futures fell at the Comex division of Nymex on the strength of the dollar, a weakening of the lease rates charged for lending gold and reduced demand for physical gold. The June contract fell $2.60 to $256.60 a troy ounce. Dollar strength is ""taking away physical demand"" and may be encouraging selling from producers in Australia and South Africa, whose currencies are way down, said Dave Meger, senior metals analyst at Chicago-based Alaron Trading Corp.

  Mileage Marathons 

 

  HERE'S ONE corporate-travel cutback you can still salvage: your frequent-flier account. 

  The slowing economy is forcing business fliers to fly less or even switch to cheaper flights on carriers that don't boost their frequent-flier accounts. But travelers looking to keep upping their miles should consider so-called cash-for-clicks programs, such as FreeAirMiles.com or MyPoints.com, which reward users for purchases as well as for looking at online sites and their advertising. One site, WebMiles.com, offers fliers universal ""WebMiles"" that can be swapped for travel on any airline with no blackout dates or seat restrictions. 

  But that doesn't do much to help your stranded miles. ""Most online shopping and other ventures will only give you one or two miles per dollar spent,"" says frequent-flier expert Randy Petersen. ""You would have to spend a lot of money clicking and shopping."" He says ""mileage runs,"" where travelers take a quick trip solely to accumulate miles, are becoming the best way to cure a mileage deficiency. Indeed, FlyerTalk.com has a Mileage Run forum where frequent-flier fanatics share secrets to add the most miles and other tricks of the trade.

  LOOKING FOR CHEAP deals on the Web? Try picking up the phone. 

  ""A lot of suppliers don't want to post a discounted fare where all their competitors will see it and match,"" says Sam Galeotos, president of Cheap Tickets Inc., which sometimes offers deals only through its call centers. For example, a round-trip fare from Richmond, Va., to Oakland, Calif., costs $376 via the call center, but $438 if you book online. That's 16% less. 

  Online discounters have long boasted that they had the cheapest deals around. While the Internet drives down prices by making it easier for consumers to shop for the best bargain, it also lets online merchants monitor and match each others' prices without overtly colluding. 

  Other online Web sites like Expedia and Travelocity insist their Web deals are still the lowest. ""Expedia prides itself on getting the best rates online,"" says a spokeswoman. ""The low fares are the online fares."" 

 

  Good News 

  Behind the Wheel 

 

  HAS ANY PART of traveling actually gotten better? 

  Yes -- rental-car companies have improved their customer service and car quality, according to a new J.D. Power & Associates survey. In a poll of 2,900 customers, business travelers gave Avis and National top marks, while Enterprise ranked highest among leisure travelers. 

  Wait times haven't improved from last year: Business renters reported average waits of 10.5 minutes for shuttle buses and 5.5 minutes for returns. Leisure travelers waited a little longer: 11 minutes for a bus and seven minutes to return cars. But customers forgave long waits when customer service was good, says Michael Taylor, director of travel services for J.D. Power. For business customers, Avis didn't score highest in speed, but compensated by having cars at the ready with their trunks open. 

  On the leisure side, Enterprise led the way on both speed and service. Overall, customers were happier with the cars themselves, with only 22% reporting problems such as engine failure or unclean cars. That's down from 33% last year. 

  Improvements have been ""trending upward"" for the last five years, Mr. Taylor says. That's ""opposite what we've seen in the rest of the industry.""

Energy prices moved lower today following yesterday?s gains, with lingering concern about demand given slower economic growth again weighing on prices. Today?s payroll data added to concern over slowing growth, while a pullback of 
US equities also added to the negative sentiment.   Similar issues also placed pressure on the industrial metals sector. 
 
Grains prices moved moderately lower today, with high stock levels continuing to cause resistance to price gains.  The ongoing dispute with China is also providing a negative backdrop given the potential for a decline in US exports to 
this region.   Supportive elements include: poor U.S. wheat conditions, expectations for a tighter world wheat balance sheet, and wet U.S. weather forecasts which could potentially reduce total corn plantings. 
 
Livestock futures moved moderately lower despite slightly higher wholesale meat values.  Speculative long liquidation in both live cattle and lean hogs pressured prices today. Expectations for lower wholesale beef prices in the near term may have also placed pressure on live cattle prices. 
 
Coffee prices continued trending lower with high stock levels continuing to indicate that producer retention plans have failed to halt significant exports.

201,"WSJ(5/2): Column: The Recession That Wasn&apos;t

 By Thomas J. Bray 
 

  (Editor's Note: This is an opinion piece from Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. Mr. Bray is a staff columnist at the Detroit News. He writes a column every Tuesday for OpinionJournal.com, where this article first appeared.) 

 

  DETROIT -- It's possible, of course, that the preliminary figures showing 2% economic growth in the first quarter are just plain wrong. But out here in the industrial Midwest, some of us are wondering if this will be the recession that never happened. 

  While the high-tech ""new economy"" may indeed be suffering from an acute inventory overhang, the ""old economy"" appears to be adjusting rapidly -- in part thanks to inventory controls made possible by the new economy. A large backlog of unsold cars, for example, has been quickly whittled down. Vehicle production is now rising at double-digit rates. 

  Consumers also are showing a certain amount of exuberance. Durable-goods sales were up 3% in March, while single-home sales rose 4.8%. Pressure on profits remain intense, and highly visible layoffs are still taking place. But there are still profits to be made, and the employment picture remains relatively strong. 

  Maybe it's a false dawn. The stock market, perhaps the best single indicator of economic expectations, has recovered some of its losses but still bounces around uncertainly, well below its 1999-2000 highs. Classified advertising at most newspapers has fallen sharply. As higher energy prices feed through the economy -- the result mainly of a lack of generating and refining capacity -- it's hard to imagine a quick return to the florid growth of prior years. 

  But if the growth number holds up, it will nonetheless present the Bush administration with the best of political scenarios: a slowdown that won't seriously threaten its rising popularity but will leave the Federal Reserve chastened by the threat of deflation and Congress focused on the need for serious tax and regulatory relief. 

  The Democrats, eager to exploit economic fears, have launched an advertising blitz designed to show Mr. Bush as little more than a pawn of corporate interests bent on protecting obscene profits, poisoning America and jeopardizing health benefits to give huge tax cuts to the very rich. 

  But the mere prospect of tax and regulatory relief may have helped stabilize the economic picture somewhat by persuading Americans that the slowdown wouldn't get out of hand. 

  Yes, consumer confidence is down, but as The Wall Street Journal revealed Monday, a clear majority of investors now think they will earn substantial returns in the coming 12 months. Indeed, the Bush team may now be in a position to argue that the stock-market collapse and brief slowdown represented little more than a return to reality after the Clinton years. 

  Mr. Bush has succeeded in establishing his presidential credentials, which may have lifted a big psychological weight from the economy. Mr. Bush has made some compromises, but the Democrats have made bigger ones -- going from opposition to any tax cut to yesterday reaching tentative agreement with congressional Republicans on a $1.35 trillion deal. 

  In so doing, they also concede Mr. Bush is not an accidental, much less an illegitimate, president. After all, he is a man who seems to know what he is doing. The malaise of the contested election has largely passed, and with it the uncertainty that the country might find itself consumed by a political firestorm, which would make it difficult to deal with unexpected crises. 

  In 1993, Bill Clinton's response to a perceived slowdown was to raise taxes and invoke the need for government ""investments."" Republicans lost some of their credibility with scare talk about how the tax increase would lead straight to economic disaster, when in fact they should have argued more prudently that the tax hike would retard recovery -- as indeed it did. 

  But in his first 100 days, President Bush resoundingly won the big economic argument -- that growth comes from improved incentives in the private sector, not more redistribution of income. Not even the far left is arguing for a reprise of the Clinton economic strategy. 

  With the economy apparently still growing, Mr. Bush can continue to move forward with his aggressive agenda. If Democrats persist in their increasingly frazzled attempts to paint Republicans as nothing more than corrupt interlopers, they risk looking just as blindly partisan as Republicans ever did.

202,"WSJE: WEEKEND JOURNAL: Collecting: Tracking The Art Markets: Next Stop, Basel

 By Margaret Studer 

  Some 262 galleries from Europe, the Americas and Asia will show this year around 5,000 works from 1,000 artists at Art 32 Basel ( June 13-June 18), the world's leading fair for 20th century and contemporary art. And if your body revolts at the thought of tramping around an art citadel of that mass, the fair does offer the services of a Wellness Center for the first time in its 32-year-old history. Visitors can have a massage for two Swiss francs (1.30 euros) a minute to ""recover from fair-induced physical stress,"" notes the fair's arm-breaking 652-page catalogue. And paying tribute to the growing number of young collectors, the fair also has installed for the first time a kindergarten, thus relieving parents for an undisturbed art hunt in the jungle of stands. This younger group has become increasingly important as ""involvement with cultural assets enjoys a rising popularity,"" says Dresdner Bank art analyst Wolfgang Wilke in the bank's latest issue of ""Trends."" What's more, there is a new gourmet restaurant in the VIP collectors' club manned by the city's star chefs: Pierre Buess of Restaurant Bruderholz (2 Michelin stars) and Evelyne and Werner Martin of Restaurant Martin in Flueh (1 Michelin star). Indeed, there's nothing like a good lunch to open a collector's wallet. 

  For six days each year, this Swiss town on the Rhine, becomes the commercial center of the global contemporary and modern art world. ""No other fair comes close to Basel. Dealers actually keep back works for the Basel fair,"" says Cheyenne Westphal, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's Europe. From the around 900 galleries that apply, only a third are chosen by the fair's selection committee. And they are a careful mix of galleries offering classical modern pieces that are priced in the millions of dollars and young art that is sold for a few thousand dollars or less. In this year's vast so-called ""Art Unlimited"" hall will be the trendy young Atelier van Lieshout's compost toilet in the form of  a fisherman's house, offered by Amsterdam's Galerie Fons Welters, for around $20,000 (23,100 euros) or the equally trendy team of Markus Muntean and Adi Rosenblum with ""Untitled"" (2000), an installation with two lost figures standing uncertainly beside a large bed priced at around $30,000 at Galerie Susanna Kulli in St. Gallen. 

  Coming after last week's round of benchmark contemporary-art auctions in New York but before London's big contemporary-art sales in the last week of June, the fair is the next major sales event on the art circuit. And whereas auction results are what reveal the state of the market for most of the year, Basel is the galleries' showcase where they become the barometer of the market's health. Among the trends illustrated at the New York sales is a growing interest in cutting edge, figurative art such as portraits by Karen Kilimnik and John Currin. In New York last week, a standing nude portrait of a woman by Currin was estimated by Christie's at up to $200,000 and went for $336,000. There's also a return to craftsmanship through painting, drawing and watercolors, says Sotheby's Ms. Westphal. And while the prices of stars such as Jeff Koons are nearing those of Andy Warhol, buying is very selective, she adds. For example, at Sotheby's last week Koons's ""Michael Jackson and Bubbles"" (1988) sold for a record $5.6 million, but at Phillips auction Koons's stainless-steel flower sculpture failed to sell. Demand for photo art continues, led by stars including Cindy Sherman, Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth, notes Ms. Westphal. At Christie's in New York, a work by Gursky ""N.Y. Mercantile Exchange"" (2000) was estimated at up to $180,000 and sold for $292,000. But on the other hand there were works by Gursky at last week's auctions that didn't sell. 

  A look through the Basel fair's catalogue shows all these trends and more. ""It will be a real mix with a lot of photography,"" says Mr. Vetsch. 

 

  Chelsea Fair 

 

  Although ArtLondon founder Ralph Ward-Jackson admits that his event with 50 exhibitors of 20th century and contemporary art is modest in comparison with Basel, he asserts the event is hard to beat for charm. The London fair takes place between June 6 and June 10 in an outdoor marquee on the King's Road, with lots of champagne on tap. Mr. Ward-Jackson encourages one-man shows. ""You tend to go gaga in Basel with all those artists. I have to take a rest,"" he says. To be included in this year's one-man shows is one devoted to British artist L.S. Lowry at the John Martin Gallery. In the same week, Christie's will auction nine Lowry paintings from the Frederick Forsyth collection at King Street on June 8. The paintings are expected to fetch a total of more than GBP 1 million (1,648,396 euros). 

  Prices generally range between GBP 500 and GBP 500,000. Although the fair's strongest contingent is British with top names such as Terry Frost, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, Graham Sutherland, Christopher Wood, Roger Hilton and Ivon Hitchens, collectors can also pick up top non-U.K. artists. The Coskun Fine Art Gallery will offer Andy Warhol's ""Playboy Bunnie"" (1985) for $55,000. And there will be a strong representation of Asian art. ""On the contemporary front, Asian art seems to be very strong in London at the moment,"" says Mr. Ward-Jackson. Asia Contemporary Art will offer political pop artist Wang Guang Yi's painting entitled ""Great Criticism - Elle"" (1997) for GBP 15,000. 

  Nevertheless, in a British election week, attention is likely to go to a set of 15 papier-mache dogs decorated in the currency of the 15 members of the European Union by Britain's Justine Smith. The Rebecca Hossack Gallery will ask GBP 1,000 per dog plus the face value of the notes on the dog's surface.

NEW YORK STOCKS: 
 

  Major market averages stumbled in thin trading Friday, after government data released Friday renewed concerns about the pace of the economy's recovery. 

  Shares of several home builders struggled in the session with Pulte declining US$2.07 to US$40.09, while Centex lost 69 cents to 37.78, and Toll Brothers retreated 1.02 to 30.97. 

  The decline followed a Commerce Department report that showed existing home sales fell more sharply than economists had anticipated, which itself trailed a surprisingly weak new home sales report Thursday. 

  Other data released Friday, including a look at durable goods orders last month and a revision to the estimate of gross domestic product last quarter, also showed weaker-than-expected conditions in the economy, suggesting that the economy's response to the recent cycle of interest-rate reductions has been sluggish. 

  Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in a speech in New York late Thursday, indicated that the economy's slowdown hasn't abated, which would suggest more rate hikes would be in the offing, something that, had the data Friday been more favorable, might have been taken a bit more constructively. 

  ""Fed Chairman Greenspan's speech last night signaled more easing ahead,"" Maury Harris, an economist at UBS Warburg, said in a report Friday, ""but didn't answer 'how much more?' or 'when?""' 

  Shares of capital-goods makers, which tend to weaken in response to sluggish economic conditions, declined, with United Technologies off 98 cents to 83.25, while Boeing lost 1.87 to 63.33. 

  Retailers also faded on concerns that consumer spending, which has been weak, won't tick up until the economy begins to flourish again. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores lost 1.69 to 51.20, while Home Depot fell 1.17 to 52.28. 

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 117.05 points lower, a decline of 1.05%, to 11005.37. The Nasdaq Composite fell 31.01, or 1.35%, to close at 2251.01. 

  Some market watchers argued that the economic data, and Greenspan's speech, which, at least arguably holds the promise of more stock-friendly rate cuts, had less to do with the outcome of Friday's trading than did the casual nature of pre-holiday trading, especially given the market's big gains coming into the session. 

  Share volume fell markedly, with 818 million shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 1.1 billion Thursday, which itself wasn't an especially busy session. 

  ""As we ease into this holiday weekend, the stock market is acting very normal,"" Don Hays, of Hays Research, said in a report Friday. ""Stocks that broke out of consolidation or bottoming formations have been spending the last couple of days consolidating back to those break-out patterns."" 

  On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,389 issues advancing, 1,637 declining and 218 unchanged. 

  NYSE volume totaled 816,082,120 shares, compared with 1,098,168,430 Thursday. 

  The NYSE Composite Index was 647.13, down 5.85. The average price per share fell 35 cents. 

 
 
NEW YORK PRECIOUS METALS: 
 

  Precious metals were trading mixed late Friday, with gold futures giving back another chunk of their gains on long liquidation by funds and other speculative players, yet bouncing back from lows, participants said. 

  ""It was long liquidation, end of week. A lot of people have had decent P&L (profit and loss),"" said a bullion dealer at a major investment bank in New York. ""Open interest is still up, so the funds are not completely out of their (long) positions.""

  Open interest in the June contract fell by 10,132 contracts on Thursday, while August open interest swelled by 13,671 contracts. 

  ""The only thing I read into it was the rollover, which isn't a surprise. That's going to be normal,"" said Dave Meger, senior metals analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. ""I assume they're longs in the market rolling. The shorts are under no pressure to do so."" 

  June gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange finished trading US$1.20 lower at US$278.20 a troy ounce. 

  He cited an abundance of fund selling Friday, but emphasized that people had been looking too hard for reasons behind the collapse of the rally, when funds are motivated mainly by technical considerations. 

  ""You get weak longs buying up near US$290 (an ounce) and you (drop to) US$280, you're going to see long liquidation. There's no big reason behind it,"" he explained. 

  Everyone was now focusing on the US$275 level, which he imagined would be taken out if only because sell-stops were accumulating under there and they were likely to be targeted next week. 

  The bulls still might have a chance at extending the rallying back up again if they managed to wash out the weak longs and prepare to advance again, he noted. 

  While it was clear to him that the absence of producer selling due to reduced returns for selling forward had been a key factor in the rally, he doubted the market coud count on them remaining sidelined for a prolonged time span. 

  The bullion dealer predicted more volatility next week, potentially leading to prices covering much the same range seen this week. He said a US$5 move to either side of the curent price was probable. 

  Comex July silver fell back, ending 3.7 cents lower at US$4.583 an ounce, after testing and failing again at the 200-day moving average of US$4.62 an ounce. 

  The 5.0% drop in durable goods orders for April, released Friday morning, hurt silver because it boded badly for industrial demand, the bullion dealer said. 

  Silver hasn't been as vulnerable as gold to liquidation of speculative long positions, said Alaron's Meger, but he had little confidence it could sustain itself above US$4.55 support or even the earlier high of US$4.515 an ounce. It was stil trading on the back of gold, he added. 

  Commission house buying pushed Nymex July platinum into buy-stop territory above US$623, a floor trader said, but the market came off to finish at US$622, up US$3 from Thursday. While he saw the gains as likely to attract more buying from funds, they are already quite long. 

  June palladium rose US$5.00 to US$660 an ounce, looking stronger and possibly preparing to head back toward US$680-$700 after the long holiday weekend, another trader said. 

 
 
NYMEX: 
 

  Refined products futures retreated Friday at the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders locked in profits ahead of Memorial Day weekend, but rose from the day's lows at the close. 

  Crude futures closed as they had opened, trading on either side of unchanged. 

  Nymex closed at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) Friday, and will be closed Monday for Memorial Day. 

  The decline in refined products contracts extended a sell-off that was sparked by gasoline futures Thursday. The sell-off came after what traders called ""panicked"" short covering Wednesday exhausted itself early Thursday, ending a sizzling rally in which futures rose 17% in a week. 

  ""That took the pressure out of the market,"" a floor trader said. ""We had a good move Thursday. We aren't getting much of a bounce. That sets the tone for the next two sessions."" 

  Crude futures could lose US$1 next week, traders said, barring refinery problems and other fundamentally bullish news. 

  Crude is being driven by declining gasoline futures and pressured by its own weak technicals and the weight of continued builds in crude stockpiles on surging imports. The nearby July crude oil contract has fallen US$2.50 from its high Wednesday. 

  Nearby gasoline futures trimmed most losses on short covering and bargain hunting at the close. June gasoline futures are 6 cents off their high from Thursday: an all-time record of US$1.1750 a gallon. The contract is seen expiring May 31 near US$1.065. Deferred gasoline contracts retreated sharply. 

  Booksquaring ahead of Memorial Day was the dominant feature of trading Friday. Volume was thin and many players were absent. 

  Concerns over thin supplies and regional shortages just ahead of the traditional Memorial Day kickoff to the summer driving season, coupled with refinery problems and a drop in reformulated summer gasoline stocks, may continue to support the petroleum complex. Tightness in the supply situation is making traders wary of aggressively selling the market short. 

  ""One refinery glitch and prices could pop 4 cents,"" an analyst said. ""Especially over a long holiday weekend."" 

  A draw in key summertime inventories triggered the latest leg up. Stocks of reformulated gasoline fell 1.4 million barrels to 39.9 million barrels in the week ended May 18, the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. That substantiated an earlier report by the American Petroleum Institute. 

  Last year, stocks were 42 million barrels.

204,"Survey: Teachers&apos; Salaries Don&apos;t Keep Pace With Inflation

 

  WASHINGTON (AP)--Teacher salaries have risen slightly in the past several years, but have failed to keep up with inflation, according to surveys released Thursday by teachers' unions. 

  The American Federation of Teachers said the average teacher salary in the 1999-2000 school year was $41,820, up 3.2% from the previous year but just short of the 3.4 inflation rate. AFT said the rise in salary was among the smallest in 40 years. 

  ""The teacher shortage plaguing school districts nationwide will not abate unless salaries improve,"" AFT President Sandra Feldman said. ""Better wages aren't the only way to retain and recruit teachers, but they sure make a difference."" 

  The National Education Association's survey found that, adjusting for inflation, teacher salaries in half of the states dropped in the last decade. 

  The NEA said teachers in West Virginia, Arkansas and Alabama saw the largest drops in real earnings, from 12 to 16%, since 1989. 

  The surveys used data from state departments of education. The unions had slightly different calculations on state-by-state salaries, but both said Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania paid teachers the most, between $48,300 and $52,400 on average. 

  Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Dakota were at the bottom of both lists, paying teachers, on average, about $30,000. South Dakota, at $29,072, paid the lowest average teacher salary in both lists. 

  AFT said the average salary increase for new teachers was actually lower in 1999 than in 1998. New teachers last year earned, on average, $27,989, up 4.2% from the previous year. In 1998, their salaries jumped 4.4%, AFT said. 

  The NEA report said that, between 1989 and 2000, average salaries rose by less than 1%, adjusted for inflation. It also said spending on K-12 education increased but didn't keep pace with the nation's economic growth. 

  While education revenue per student increased 3.6% from the 1998 to 1999, NEA said, total personal income in the United States grew 5.9%. 

  ""It's inexcusable that during a decade of unprecedented economic growth in this country, students were left behind. What does that say about the real value we place on education?"" said NEA President Bob Chase. 

  New teachers' salaries also lost ground to starting wages in other white-collar professions, the NEA said. 

  While a new teacher could expect to earn about $27,989, college graduates could expect an average starting salary of $47,112 for engineering jobs, $46,495 for computer science jobs and $40,242 for jobs in business. 

  ""I don't think there's anybody who doesn't wish teachers could be paid more, said Bruce Hunter, director of public policy for the American Association of School Administrators. ""It really gets down to, 'Can you?""' 

  Hunter said many states are watching good teachers leave for states that pay higher salaries. 

  ""In some places the taxpayers have been very generous, and in some places they haven't,"" he said.

205,"WSJ(5/30): Brazil Proposal To Boost Thermal Power Comes Late

 By Jonathan Karp 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The government is poised to remove a key obstacle to the construction of thermoelectric-power plants in a move that foreign investors said is welcome but two years too late to avert the country's energy crisis. 

  Brazil urgently needs thermal power to reduce its almost-exclusive dependence on hydroelectricity. But many foreign investors have balked because of the high foreign-exchange risk involved in paying dollars for natural gas, used to fuel the plants, but being able to sell the electricity at prices set in Brazil's currency. Under a new plan, the government will set natural-gas prices annually and state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, which will supply most of the gas, will absorb foreign-exchange variations. 

  ""This is one step forward. Gas is 50% of a power plant's cost,"" said Luiz David Travesso, head of AES Corp.'s Brazil unit. The Arlington, Va., utility, one of the largest U.S. investors in Brazil, suspended $2 billion in planned power projects earlier this month in a warning to the government to clarify investment and regulatory rules. 

  Mr. Travesso said it is too early to resume talks over the plants because there are other issues to be resolved, such as long-term financing and provisions for electricity distributors to raise consumer rates in line with rising energy prices. 

  Drought and rising demand have drained Brazil's reservoirs. The country is to begin rationing energy this week in an attempt to reduce consumption by 20% and prevent blackouts. The crisis has revived efforts to accelerate the construction of power plants fired by plentiful natural gas from Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina. 

  A two-year-old government plan envisioned 49 new thermal-power plants, but just nine are under construction, said Paulo Feldmann, head of Ernst & Young's energy practice in Sao Paulo. ""It's a pity. If the government had resolved the gas issue a year-and-a-half ago, these thermal plants would be operating,"" he said. 

  The new natural-gas scheme won't satisfy all 49 planned projects, because Petrobras managed to cap its supply so as to reduce its financial exposure. 

  Separately, the Brazilian unit of Canada's Alcan Inc. said it is preparing to cut aluminum production in the next six months by almost 25% because of power rationing.

206,"WSJ(6/29): Column: Argentina&apos;s Econ Measures Are Pro-Growth

 
  By Domingo F. Cavallo 
 

  (Editor's Note: Mr. Cavallo is Argentina's economy minister.) 

 

  Two weeks ago the Argentine government launched a new package of measures aimed at improving fiscal solvency, enhancing competitiveness, and reigniting domestic demand and economic growth. 

  No economic recovery can take place without an improvement in Argentina's macroeconomic fundamentals. This is why our earlier policy changes, announced over the past couple of months, have focused on this objective. New tax measures and cuts in public spending were designed to consolidate fiscal matters. A successful debt exchange, carried out last month, will create a substantial reduction in financing needs over the next five years. Competitiveness plans focus on reducing tax pressure on domestic producers so as to encourage investment, employment and growth. 

  Now we have moved to strengthen these policies. On the fiscal side we are declaring an all-out war against tax evasion and privatizing the collection of tax arrears. In terms of competitiveness, we are moving to protect domestic producers from adverse external shocks and boosting domestic demand through additional measures aimed at encouraging consumption and investment. 

  This government is committed to building a tax system with only two taxes: the value-added tax (VAT) and the income tax. This new tax system will require mechanisms to reduce the current levels of tax evasion. To tackle these objectives the government is establishing a uniform payroll tax of 16%. If this new rate increases an individual's tax burden, the difference may be credited toward his or her VAT. Only those who were previously evading income tax will pay more. We are also changing the VAT payment regime to a cash basis -- from an accrual basis -- in order in order to facilitate taxpayers' financial management and also compliance control. 

  The new measures also include the implementation of a privately managed system to collect tax arrears. The private manager will establish a trust fund, which will be made up of unpaid taxes as its assets and tax credits owed as its liabilities. The liabilities will be securitized as bonds and given to corporations that are due the credits. This will convert tax credits, previously immobilized on balance sheets, into liquid instruments. It is expected that a private manager will collect tax arrears more efficiently than the government. And collection improvements will reduce the incentive for tax evasion. 

  To enhance competitiveness and encourage exports the government is implementing a comprehensive set of trade-policy instruments that we call the ""convergence factor."" Exports will be rewarded with an adjustable reimbursement equal to the difference between the present exchange rate -- one U.S. dollar -- and the rate under the enhanced convertibility law, which is a simple average of the dollar and the euro. At the present time that difference is approximately 7 cents. 

  Similarly, imports will pay a tariff, also adjustable, and of the same magnitude. In order to compensate for the short-run price effects associated with the convergence factor, the maximum import tariff on consumer goods and the maximum reimbursement on exports are reduced 7 percentage points. 

  It is worth noting that the new mechanism has nothing to do with old-fashioned dual exchange-rate regimes. It preserves dollar convertibility in its present form for peso holders, fully respecting their property rights, and does not imply a modification of the exchange system of the Argentine peso. The payments will be done through current trade-policy practices with no participation whatsoever of the Central Bank or monetary authorities, which will continue to exchange one peso for one dollar as required by the convertibility law. Reserves of the Central Bank play no role in the scheme, which in no way is related to currency transactions. 

  The convergence factor fluctuates on the basis of the dollar-euro exchange rate and, to the extent that these currencies approach parity, it would converge to zero. When dollar-euro parity is reached, the new dollar-euro method of valuing the peso will take effect, and therefore the need for the convergence factor will disappear. 

  The new mechanism also generates resources for the government. Since fuels will be excluded, and our trade has a significant surplus in this area, income will be larger than payments. The elimination of reimbursements adds to the fiscal savings of the measure. In all the government expects to collect almost $600 million from these trade-related measures. 

  The strengthened competitiveness of the tradable sector is a key element for sustaining long-run economic growth. However, the government recognizes that an economic recovery requires domestic demand. In order to boost domestic demand (consumption and investment) the government has designed two measures. First, to underpin recovery of domestic consumption, we have implemented an income-tax cut for families with medium and low incomes. The cut increases disposable income by about $500 million. Second, to strengthen the infrastructure plan, and to enhance its execution capacity, a Road Network Fund will be created, financed by a modification of the toll system and fuel taxes. The fuel-tax adjustment will sharply reduce gasoline prices, putting another $500 million in consumers' pockets. This will be financed by an increase in diesel taxes that can be counted as prepayment against the VAT. 

  The fiscal impact of these measures is estimated to be above $600 million, yet improving fiscal balance is not the main purpose of the latest policy changes. The focus is improving competitiveness and reducing tax evasion, thus increasing fairness and making it possible to lower rates for everyone. 

  In this sense, we address not only social concerns but also market concerns: to improve the fight against tax evasion, to consolidate fiscal resources, and to shield the economy from additional appreciation of the dollar. This completes our short-run economic policy measures, which were made in installments because of the constraints produced by the need for congressional approval of specific legislation. 

  We will now move to long-run structural measures such as social-security reform, the improvement of the health-care system, and even stronger trade liberalization. Friday's decision to set up a single trade negotiator for Mercosur is a good starting point. This negotiator will be given the task of working to open the markets of the European Union and the U.S.

207,"WSJ(6/25): US Faces Fight For &quot;Smart&quot; Sanctions Against Iraq

 
  By Neil King Jr. and Bhushan Bahree 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Bush administration officials enter a week of tough diplomacy at the United Nations today on fears that international opposition could thwart efforts to build a new ""smart"" sanctions system for Iraq. 

  Facing deep resistance among Iraq's neighbors and its allies Russia and China, the U.S. and Britain say they will continue to push for a Security Council vote on a new Iraq resolution before a July 3 deadline. But senior U.S. officials concede that many forces are stacked against them and that a vote is likely to be put off for a month or longer - and could be scrapped altogether. 

  Iraq hasn't exported any oil under the U.N. oil-for-food program for three weeks in protest over the sanctions initiative, depriving the world market of an average flow of about 2.1 million barrels a day. Further delays at the U.N. could keep that oil off the market for months, although Baghdad's punitive move has so far done little to affect prices or squeeze supplies. 

  Defeat at the U.N. would be a sharp blow to Secretary of State Colin Powell, who plunged into Iraq diplomacy in his first weeks in office in a bid to rebuild an international consensus to contain Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Failure would also leave the current sanctions system in a shambles and give weight to those within the administration who favor launching a U.S.-backed armed insurgency to topple the Iraqi government. 

  The U.S. and British plan, now into its third draft resolution, aims to allow a free flow of goods into Iraq except for a core list of items whose import would need U.N. approval. The administration also has promised to find ways to crack down on the import of illegal military goods into Iraq and to cut off the smuggling of Iraqi oil, an effort that has largely run aground due to opposition among neighboring states like Jordan and Syria. 

  Much of the diplomatic skirmishing still swirls around a list of dual-use items that would require U.N. approval before Iraq could buy them. Russia and China want a much leaner list to allow Iraq easy access to telecommunications and other equipment that they argue pose no military threat. 

  France and Russia, who like Security Council member China can veto any resolution, also want to open the way for some foreign investment, particularly in Iraq's decrepit oil industry. The U.S. says it will oppose any provision that could end up enriching Saddam Hussein. 

  U.S. officials admit they underestimated the difficulty of squeezing so many clashing interests and proposals into a three- or four-page resolution that would then win the support of all 15 Security Council members. But other developments have gone against them since the effort began. The fighting between Palestinians and Israelis got bloodier, spreading anger through the Arab world. And Iraqi threats to cut off the flow of cheap oil to its neighbors made countries like Jordan and Syria less than keen to sign onto a new sanctions system. 

  U.S. officials, though, say their largest obstacle now is Russia. Moscow would prefer to get rid of the 11-year-old sanctions on Iraq altogether and views the latest round of U.S. diplomacy as little more than a stalling tactic. Still, one U.S. official said the administration still hopes to win Russia over, though it remains unclear what concessions the U.S. might offer to get Moscow's support. 

  Russia successfully pushed for an open debate on Iraq within the Security Council for tomorrow afternoon in what many predict could be a lively session. U.S. diplomats have criticized the debate as a time-consuming distraction, but say they hope to use the forum to sway skeptics. 

  On the oil side, the market has largely been calmed by repeated pledges from Saudi Arabia that the kingdom will raise output if the loss of crude from Iraq begins to squeeze the world market. The Saudis have said they would boost exports if necessary in a coordinated move with others in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC's ministers have called a ministerial meeting for July 3 in Vienna, less than a month after they last met following the Iraqi shutdown and decided to hold output steady.

  SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--Meeting market expectations, Brazil's key consumer price index slowed in May thanks to an easing in food inflation. 

  But the deceleration was partly offset by a pickup in transportation costs. 

  The government-run IBGE statistics institute Tuesday said the IPCA Broad Consumer Price Index advanced 0.41% in May, compared with a 0.58% increase in April. 

  According to a Dow Jones Newswires' survey of 15 economists, the average forecast pointed to a 0.41% rise in the IPCA Broad Consumer Price Index in May. Projections ranged from increases of between 0.21% to 0.45%. 

  The May figure put the 12-month inflation rate at 7.04% and the year-to-date increase at 2.42%. 

  The easing in food price inflation is on the back of the arrival of crops on the market following harvest, combined with a drop in beef prices on the market following a series of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the southern prime cattle-raising state of Rio Grande do Sul. 

  IBGE said food prices in May rose 0.58%, compared with an increase of 1.80% in April. The turnaround in food price inflation comes after months of pressure from the category on the overall index. 

  The slowdown in the May rate, though, was partly offset by the city of Sao Paulo boosting bus fares by 22% last month, the IBGE said. 

  Despite the easing in the pace of inflation, the matter continues to be a big concern as Latin America's biggest nation now deals with a six-month electricity rationing plan that is likely to cut into economic growth and push prices higher. The rationing program, which started June 1, requires industry, commerce and retail users to cut electricity use by an average 20% a month. 

  The slowdown in May comes ahead of electricity distributors raising fees between June and July and that this factor, combined with high international oil prices and the sharp depreciation of the local currency, is expected to drive inflation higher in coming months. The weak real, which has lost some 19% of its value since the start of the year, so far has mainly affected prices on the wholesale level. 

  The falling currency is also making Brazilian oil imports more expensive and the energy crunch could also send housing costs higher, as the government plans to levy a surcharge on those consumers that fail to meet their energy-saving targets. 

  Opinion is divided among analysts over whether the central bank, which has a 4% IPCA target for this year, will further hike interest rates to keep inflation in check. The goal has a two-percentage-point leeway either side and central bank governor Arminio Fraga recently said inflation could reach 5.5% this year. 

  While some advocate more hikes as inflation remains a threat, others believe that more monetary tightening this year would be useless as the moves would only affect 2002 prices. Inflationary concerns led the central bank to raise the country's benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 16.75% between March and May. That reversed a two-year policy of monetary easing. 

  The hikes and the energy crisis are expected to shave between one to two percentage points of the initially forecast 4% to 4.5% growth rate for 2001, while also slowing growth next year.

209,"BoE Watch: Growing Imbalances May Cause Econ To Wobble

 
 
   By Gonzalo Vina 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

  (This story was originally published Friday) 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The Bank of England are becoming increasingly concerned that different parts of the British economy are moving at varying speeds. 

  As trade figures indicated only too clearly earlier this week, exports are being hurt by the strength of the pound and the global economic downturn while imports are soaring to meet the insatiable appetites of British consumers. 

  The central bank has also been confronted with trying to insulate the U.K. from the effects of a global economic downturn by cutting interest rates, at a time when the housing market, retail sales and consumer borrowing could do with the opposite. 

  And if that weren't enough, the big public spending increases pledged by the government will pump extra money into the economy over the next few years. 

  During his annual Mansion House speech, the governor of the Bank of England Eddie George, warned that these imbalances can't go on forever and the ""elastic is likely to break - possibly through an exchange rate adjustment"". 

  And having recently deliberately stimulated domestic demand to offset the effects of the global downturn, that demand will have to be reined back, even though the momentum could prove hard to stop, he added. 

  While the governor also said that this moment is not yet here, it explains the rate stetting Monetary Policy Committee's reluctance to drop rates more sharply in recent months. 

  For Danny Gabay, an economist at JP Morgan in London, George's comments are a clear signal that interest rates will stay on hold at 5.75%. 

  ""His (George's) key theme was the twin-speed economy: external weakness and domestic strength - the latter partly deliberately engineered by the MPC to offset the former. However, in an emphatic statement of rates on hold, he noted that this policy could do little to offset external weakness, but ran the risk of exacerbating the growing imbalances within the economy,"" said Gabay. 

  The central bank's deputy governor also did much to highlight these imbalances during a lecture in Cardiff and, while mentioning that he was keeping an eye on creeping inflation, he did much to play down any worries attributing the recent rises to seasonal food and gasoline price rises. 

  The central bank is in tight spot. It faces rising inflation and an overactive consumer sector which it can do little to curb because of uncertainty still surrounding the U.S. and now euro-zone economies. 

  Furthermore, the political necessities of the current government could also make these imbalances worsen. The Labour Party was voted in for a second term with what Prime Minister Tony Blair regards as a clear mandate to improve public services above all. 

  Geoffrey Dicks, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland believes that government spending pledges will add fuel to an already roaring fire. 

  He looks back to 1987, the last time a Chancellor loosened the country's' purse strings at a time when consumer demand was strong. 

  ""The parallels with 1987, when a reelected government found itself having to deliver on election promises, will worry those on the MPC with long memories,"" he said. 

  Dicks notes how the Conservative Chancellor of the day, Nigel Lawson, was reelected on the promise of further tax cuts. Lawson thought the public sector surplus was structural and expected consumer spending to slow. In the event, neither proved true. 

  Dicks says that with public accounts in similar shape but, like the '80s, the economic resources aren't there. 

  ""The economy is operating at, or close to, full employment; consumer spending is booming on the back of Budget tax cuts and lower interest rates, though once again the Treasury is pinning its colors on deceleration which as far as retail sales are concerned are nowhere in sight,"" he said. 

  For him, the MPC has run out of room for maneuver. ""At some stage they will have to rein the consumer back in - earlier if sterling falls or later if the euro weakness persists"".

210,"Saudi Arabia Expected To Achieve 2001 Budget Surplus

 
 

  By Abdulla Fardan 

  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

  MANAMA, Bahrain (Dow Jones)--Saudi Arabia looks set to achieve another budget surplus this year because of firmer-than-forecast oil prices, regional analysts say. 

  In December the government had estimated a balanced budget of $57.30 billion for the current year, having run its first surplus for 18 years of $12 billion in 2000 on the back of higher oil prices and petroleum production. 

  Based on these figures, analysts predicted the kingdom had factored in a conservative price for Saudi oil of $21-$22 a barrel for 2001. 

  In the event, the country's oil sold for an average $26/bbl in 2000 (about 45% above expectations) and has averaged close to this level so far this year. 

  But analysts cautioned that with another six months to go, the picture could change unexpectedly and that, in any case, they don't expect last year's huge surplus to be repeated. 

  ""The Saudi economy is benefiting from firm oil prices now, but if something (unfavorable) were to happen in the oil market, the outlook will change..."" said Sa'id Al-Shaikh, chief economist at the Saudi National Commercial Bank in Jeddah. 

  He added that the government is currently earning at least $3/bbl above what it estimated for its 2001 budget. 

  ""I would expect that if they are disciplined on expenditure, there will be a small surplus - not as much as last year, but there will be a surplus,"" Al-Shaikh said. 

  Brad Bourland, chief economist at the Saudi American Bank in Riyadh, said if oil prices stay the same, the government could run a surplus of ""several billion riyals."" But on average, they are expected to be lower than in 2000, he added. 

  Last month, the country's Finance Minister, Ibrahim Al-Assaf, said the government had already achieved its budget target for the first half of 2001, factoring in expected revenues from June oil contracts. 

  Last year, Saudi Arabia increased its oil output by more than one million barrels a day, in line with increases by other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 

  So far this year, OPEC has cut production by 2.5 million b/d, with Saudi Arabia's share of this just above 800,000 b/d. 

  However OPEC is widely expected to increase output in the third quarter, which will impact both on global oil prices and Saudi revenues. 

  Oil receipts account for about 75% of total Saudi government revenue. 

 
           Real 2001 GDP Seen At Around 2.5% 
 

  Al-Assaf recently said he expects economic growth this year to be no less than in 2000, at a real rate of 4.5%. 

  But local economists predict that real GDP this year will be closer to 2.5% because of expected lower oil prices and production. The oil sector makes up about 40% of total GDP. 

  Other parts of the economy are expected to achieve good growth this year on the back of healthy oil prices. 

  The Saudi government owns around 70% of the domestic petrochemical industry, the largest in the Middle East. The construction sector, whose performance has traditionally tracked the price of oil, has shown consistent growth since the third quarter of last year.

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Precious metals were trading mostly lower late Wednesday, with gold futures slipping on fund and trade selling, turning their back on the euro's gains, participants said. 

  Initial pressure came from funds choosing to liquidate some of their stagnant long positions in August gold rather than rolling them forward into later months, a trader at an international bank in New York said. 

  Later, ""gold got sold down by the trade into some sell-stops below $268 (an ounce),"" said broker John Fimat at Fimat in New York. ""When stops are discovered to be someplace, the market will usually go to them.""

  With just three more active days remaining for the August contract, more long liquidation - and further easing in gold prices - is likely, Geneva-based MKS Finance SA said in its daily report. 

  Precious metals strategist Kevin Crisp at CSFB in London saw the stronger euro sustaining European consumer buying - especially by jewelry fabricators in Italy. But even though the euro was trading near $0.88, gold prices came off. 

  The $265-$270 range remains intact, however, due to physical demand, and MKS Finance expected the more robust euro to lead gold higher again once the rollover has finished.

215,"Dollar Has A Bad Week Vs Majors; Future Cloudy Vs Euro

 
 
   By John Hardy 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The dollar is used to having its own way in the currency markets, particularly against the euro, but this past week told a very different story. 

  Against the dollar, the euro is up 2.4% for the week, the yen is 1.4% firmer and the Swiss franc, the biggest mover of all, is up 2.9%. Even the pound has gained 2%. 

  The last time the dollar slipped on this scale against the euro was back in early April, when the single currency rose by more than 3% in a week and bounced above 90 cents. 

  That euro rally proved to be a fake-out and the single currency promptly fell into a tailspin which culminated earlier this month with a new low for the year at $0.8350, little more than a cent about its all-time bottom at $0.8230 last October. 

  This time, the euro may be able to sustain a recovery as the market's tone has definitely changed. 

  ""The euro is now shrugging off every piece of bad news it gets - just like the dollar used to, "" said Greg Salvaggio, trading manager at Tempus Consulting in Washington. 

  However, the foreign exchange market is still split on whether this latest euro rally is a real indication that the currency's dog days are over. 

  ""I think the euro is going to crash again,"" said Laurie Cameron, currency strategist in the private bank at J.P. Morgan in New York, voting for the euro-bear approach. 

  On the other hand, the euro is winning some supporters. In his weekly forecasting outlook, Jim O'Neill, chief economist of Goldman Sachs in London, sees the euro rising to 88 cents in the near term and then breaking above $1.00 by the end of the year. The last time the euro was at parity with the dollar was in January 2000. 

  In New York afternoon trading, the euro was at $0.8723, above $0.8715 in London and $0.8710 in New York late Thursday. The dollar was at Y122.95, down from Y123.31 in London and down from Y123.24 late Thursday. 

  Three key factors seem to have been at the root of the dollar's problems this week and they bode ill for the U.S. currency in the future. 

  First, the U.S. economy is no longer the clear winner in the international growth stakes. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave a downbeat assessment of the economy, in his closely-watched Congressional testimony, stating that risks in the coming months remain clearly to the downside. 

  Second, the euro zone is definitely doing a little better and its economic numbers are no longer as damaging as they once were. This week, French industrial production for May increased 0.3%, compared with a 0.4% decline in April. 

  Inflation, which has been seen as limiting the European Central Bank's ability to cut interest rates, seems to be abating. Euro-zone consumer prices for June came in at an increase of 0.1% for the month and 3.0% for the year, better than expected. 

  Third, and perhaps most worrying, is a lessening of the dollar's domestic and international stature. 

  Currency markets have become increasingly confused by the widely publicized debate over the U.S. strong dollar policy. 

  There are frequent and vociferous calls for a more exporter-friendly dollar policy and Gordon Richard, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, sees the currency's strength as ""a speculative bubble that refuses to burst and needs to be deflated."" 

  Both President George Bush and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have attempted to still the debate in recent days but without success. The Bush Administration has made it clear, however, it has no intention of altering U.S. sollar policy. 

  But doubts about the strong dollar's future are now haunting the U.S. currency's performance aheaqd of this weekend's Group of Seven leading nations' meeting in Genoa, Italy. 

  ""The market seems to have caught the bug that the G7 is going to successfully badger the U.S. into abandoning its strong dollar policy,"" said Salvaggio. ""Some major players honestly believe that some modification of policy may be coming - people have been very jittery,"" he added. 

  Finally, the dollar's international standing has been hurt in recent weeks by the market's dollar-negative reaction to the ongoing crisis in Argentina and its implications for other emerging markets in Latin America and elsewhere. 

  The dollar was sold as rumors of a financial crisis multiplied and the euro may have benefited by association with the Swiss franc. 

  ""The reason the European currencies are strong is that the Swiss franc is a safe haven against (problems in) Argentina,"" said Cameron. 

  This issue could easily cloud the dollar's future. ""I am still fearful that we haven't seen the end of the problems in Argentina,"" she said and added that Mexico could be hurt also.

216,"Venezuela&apos;s Oil Sector Badly Hurt By 1H &apos;01 Oil Cuts

 
 

  (This article was originally published Thursday) 

    By Fred Pals 
    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Two consecutive oil production cuts required by agreements with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had a major impact on Venezuela's oil sector in the first half. 

  President Hugo Chavez revealed Thursday that the  sector contracted 3% from January to June. 

  Despite that contraction, gross domestic product expanded 3.4% in the first half thanks to a strong performance in the non-oil economy. 

   ""As you know, we follow a strategy to defend oil prices and keep them in the price band,"" Chavez said. 

  OPEC has adopted a price range requiring members to cut production when its reference oil basket slips beneath $22 or increase it when the basket exceeds $28 for a set number of days. 

  Once a notorious quota buster, Venezuela has turned into an upstanding member of OPEC under the Chavez administration. Including a third reduction in output effective Sept. 1, the country will have removed some 416,000 barrels a day from the market so far this year in compliance with its OPEC obligations. 

  Venezuela's new quota will stand at 2.67 million b/d, a level not seen since early 1998. The country's current quota stands at 2.79 million b/d. 

  In Venezuela's $100 billion economy, oil accounts for half of government revenue and 80% of its export earnings. It represents about a third of gross domestic product. 

 
   Incipient Criticism After Disappointing Figures 
 

  But Venezuela's hawkish position within OPEC is likely to come under fire again with the release of the latest numbers. 

  According to Hugo Hernandez Rafalli, the president of the local Petroleum Chamber, Venezuela could end up losing on both market share and oil income if the price-over-production strategy continues without adjustment. 

  Industry analysts see enough output from non-OPEC producers coming onstream next year to threaten OPEC's pricing strategy. 

  Slowing U.S. and global economies coupled with growing non-OPEC production have combined to put downward pressure on prices, prompting OPEC to cut its aggregate production. 

  The 2001 running average of Venezuela's basket of crude oil and refined products stands at $21.90/bbl, down from $25.91/bbl last year. 

  Alan Viergutz, a local oil analyst, said OPEC's  strategy to keep prices at the midlevel of the $22 to $28 a barrel range will lead to the worst-case scenario: low prices, low production and much idle output capacity. 

  Analysts suggest that at OPEC's target price range, many non-OPEC producers are profitable, and that their production has been coming on stream. 

  But the price-over-supply policy is built into Venezuela's budget: the 2001 budget is based on a basket price of $20 a barrel. Officials say a high price nets the country more foreign exchange than increased output. Hence the interest in cutting output to support prices. 

  Still, several government officials have already suggested that a lower average target for 2002 would be prudent. 

  Rafalli said it would be healthy to lower OPEC's target price to prevent more cutting. ""Lowering the $22 to $28 range is an issue for OPEC to discuss at their next meeting in September,"" Rafalli said. 

  However, there are some bright spots ahead. Given an expected increase in seasonal demand, OPEC is unlikely to cut its oil production a fourth time this year. Also, state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. usually starts spending most of its budget during the second half of the year on maintenance works. 

  That should spur economic activity among the sector's ancillary goods and services businesses, which have been directly affected by the country's oil cuts.

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT 
 

  10:44 (Dow Jones) DirecTV-owner Hughes Electronics (GMH), which received a $30.4 billion unsolicited bid from rival EchoStar (DISH) Sunday, is likely to receive a sweeter offer - either from previous bidder News Corp. (NWS) or from Echostar, some market observers predict. That makes the spread - at a $1.94, or 9.7%, discount to Echostar's offer on Thursday's close - attractive, according to Lehman risk arbitrage monitor. ""The downside in GMH shares is minimal, as Hughes traded up only marginally after the offer was announced,"" the report says. Based on current spread, traders peg the chance of the deal getting done at about 50%, which matches Lehman's assessment of an EchoStar-Hughes definitive deal winning regulatory approval. (JAW) 

  10:38 (Dow Jones) The Naz Composite's four-month consolidation tentatively became at least a short-term bear market when the index slipped below 1934.67 support this morning. That's formal if the index closes below 1934.67. Ditto DJIA using its 10241.02 technical level. (SC) 

  10:26 (Dow Jones) Selling starting to pick up in stocks. For now, discount the deflation talk - it's been bandied about for awhile, but the core rate of inflation edged up 0.2% in July. Stocks are in another one of their funks, and for some good reasons: growth in profits and the economy are invisible, and hopes of some improvement keep getting pushed off. Technically, the Nasdaq is in trouble, particularly with close below 1934. Some will even suggest the index is poised for a return to April 4 low, right around 1600. DJIA off 88 at 10210, Nasdaq down 44 at 1920, and S&P 500 falls 12 to 1170. (TG) 

  10:14 (Dow Jones) Expect the calendar for high-yield bond deals to keep growing: junk bond funds took in another robust $385M in new money this week, says AMG Data Services. That follows last week's whopping $551M inflow, bringing the total for the year to around $5.5 billion. (RTB) 

  10:11 (Dow Jones) Northern Trust Co. economist Paul Kasriel says ""a weaker dollar is the last thing the U.S. should want right now."" (JCC) 

  10:05 (Dow Jones) September's not always the happiest month, with kids grudgingly heading back to school and adults back to work. But it may be even worse for some employees at securities firms. That's when analysts are expecting the next round of job cuts to start if market conditions don't improve. Firms are likely to wait until September - and even October - to see if the trading and investment banking drought lets up, analysts said. If not, they see more cuts on the way. (CWM) 

  9:55 (Dow Jones) We know earnings warnings from S&P 500 companies, particularly technology and consumer cyclicals, have jumped this year. Credit Suisse First Boston's quantitative analysis team studied these and noted that investors tend to overreact to warnings and underreact to positive guidance, and that a company that warned once had a 63% chance of warning again. So the team screened CSFB's hold-rated S&P 500 list for likely recalcitrants that had warned for the first time this year, and came up with some 20 names including Scientific-Atlanta (SFA), Sapient Corp. (SAPE), Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), Sears Roebuck (S), Network Appliance (NTAP) and TIffany & Co. (TIF). (KT) 

  9:48 (Dow Jones) Little downside in WebMD (HLTH), UBS Warburg says (with stock off 7% at $5.22, now there's even less). Disappointing 2Q revenue reflects more softness in markets for physicians software and Internet advertising, UBS says. Long-term prospects intact, though there are few near-term catalysts. Keeps buy rating, but cuts price target to $11 from $14. (TG) 

  9:39 (Dow Jones) Mykrolis (MYK), a semiconductor-related company carved out of Millipore (MIL), priced its IPO of 7 million shares at $15 each, the low end of price talk of $15 to $17. The deal is one of just two IPOs set to trade before the new-issues market shuts down for its holiday hiatus. Deal flow returns - if we're lucky - in late September. (RJH) 

  9:27 (Dow Jones) Nymex crude is expected to open 20-30 cents a barrel higher on follow-through buying. Rising tensions in the Middle East amid Israeli bombing of a Palestinian police station and US-UK airstrikes against Iraqi defense sites are seen as supportive. IEA's minor upward revision of 2001 global oil demand growth is somewhat bullish, an analyst says. Technically, Thursday's positive close is viewed as encouraging by bulls who say recent consolidation may be over. Sept. crude, up 23c at $27.87 overnight, faces resistance at $27.90-$28.05 and recent high of $28.40; support is seen at $27.10-$27.20. (MXF) 

  9:13 (Dow Jones) Now may be the time to buy American International Group (AIG), according to Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein's insurance analyst Kenneth Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg recommends buying the insurer before its acquisition of American General Corp. closes later this month, citing expected EPS accretion of 8% to 10% after the merger and the large position the deal gives AIG in the U.S. life insurance market. His price target is $100. AIG closed Thursday at $81.40. (CUB) 

  9:06 (Dow Jones) New York Times reports that Flooz.com, an Internet company that offered online currency, shut its web site and is considering ceasing operations. Evidence that there are some things, such as producing a currency, government is better suited for than private sector. (NL) 

  9:00 (Dow Jones) UAL Corp.'s (UAL) United Airlines expects to record a gain of $270 million from the pending $2.9 billion acquisition of Galileo International (GLC) by Cendant (CD). United Airlines owns 15,940,000 shares, or 18%, of Galileo, a provider of electronic global distribution services for the travel industry, according to UAL's quarterly report. United Airlines, as the largest stockholder of Galileo, has entered an agreement with Cendant to support the transaction and has provided Cendant with a proxy to vote the Galileo shares it owns in favor of the transaction.

218,"AWSJ: Toshiba Plans To Cut 20,000 Jobs In Japan

 
  By Peter Landers 
  Staff Reporter 

  TOKYO -- Toshiba Corp. announced it will cut 20,000 jobs in Japan, adding its name to a growing list of Japanese electronic manufacturers that are trimming their work forces as part of corporate overhauls. But Toshiba also followed the pack by insisting that its myriad business units are more valuable together than apart. 

  The company's move was sparked by a plunge in world-wide semiconductor prices. Toshiba expects a 94 billion yen ($782.9 million) operating loss in semiconductors in the year ending March 31, 2002, almost all of it from memory chips. Toshiba's revised outlook for the year calls for a group net loss of 115 billion yen, compared with a 96 billion yen net profit in the year ended March 31, 2001. Sales are expected to fall 3.4% to 5.75 trillion yen. 

  The specifics of the job cuts remain unclear, but no one is being fired or laid off. Toshiba said it expects attrition to account for about half of the 20,000-job reduction, while the other half would come from restructuring some of its units, and voluntary early retirement. However, the cuts, which amount to nearly 14% of the company's jobs in Japan, won't be completed until March 2004. Toshiba said it expects its domestic work force to total around 127,000 then, compared with 144,000 now, because it also plans to hire several thousand people in the meantime. 

  Investors welcomed the news, bidding Toshiba's stock price up 5.6% to 604 yen a share, outpacing a 1% gain on the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. 

  President Tadashi Okamura declined to comment on what is expected to be the biggest of the restructuring moves - a merger of Toshiba's memory-chip business with either Infineon Technologies AG of Germany or South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. People familiar with the situation said over the weekend that Toshiba is discussing a deal with the two companies but Mr. Okamura refused to confirm the talks. 

  Despite the cuts, Mr. Okamura insisted that Toshiba will remain a comprehensive electronics maker - known as sogo denki - amid the growing challenge of controlling an unwieldy array of business units. Toshiba's products include electronics parts such as semiconductors; consumer electronics such as TV sets, personal computers and mobile telephones; and heavy industrial equipment. 

  ""The biggest feature of Toshiba is that we produce synergy effects"" from the various businesses, said Mr. Okamura. He said he plans to transfer more power to the heads of company units, while at the same time encouraging those unit leaders to work more closely with each other. 

  Fujitsu Ltd., which announced 16,400 job cuts last week, also said it has no plans to abandon the sogo denki model. Fujitsu's president, Naoyuki Akikusa, acknowledged that American companies such as Intel Corp. have been successful by focusing on a single product area, but added, ""We don't think that is the ideal for our industry."" 

  The problem with the sogo denki model is the failure of Japanese electronics companies to produce consistent profits. Most made only modest amounts of money even during the information-technology bubble that gripped the U.S. last year. Recently, ratings agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of many of the major companies. 

  Monday, Standard & Poor's Corp. warned that it might downgrade Sony Corp.'s debt rating. S&P questioned whether Sony can meet its profit targets ""given the persistent downturn in demand in the electronics market.""

219,"BOJ Watch -2: Markets Listen To Govt, Not Hayami, Now

 
 

  Not only did the BOJ change policy, it broke its own taboo on expanding its JGB purchases - something it has long fretted could open the door to unlimited government spending. 

  Indeed, one BOJ source said policymaking this week was haphazard. 

  The easing was hastily arranged and, if the economy worsens sharply further, the BOJ will just have to improvise again, the source said. 

  In predicting the next step, said Merrill Lynch fixed income strategist Masuhisa Kobayashi, ""The market will pay closer attention now to remarks from Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa or Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka than from the BOJ governor."" 

  Takenaka lauded the BOJ as a ""deflation-fighter"" after Tuesday's easing and Shiokawa praised the move, but both ministers clearly want more. 

  Particularly, they want the BOJ to set a positive inflation target to obligate the central bank to actively stimulate prices. The central bank promised in March to maintain its loose policy until consumer prices - which have slid unabated for two years - clearly stop falling. 

  But the BOJ hasn't bound itself specifically to making prices turn around, only to waiting until the consumer price index stabilizes at zero or above year-on-year. 

  Hayami again this week insisted he's not considering inflation targets. The bank has long argued that targets have worked in bringing down high inflation but that setting an inflation goal for a deflationary economy would damage the bank's credibility since there are no convincing ways to achieve the target. 

  ""The BOJ governor is now against inflation targeting but it won't be surprising if he reverses that view,"" Kobayashi said. ""He used to be against buying JGBs too."" 

  How could the BOJ create inflation? 

  ""Buy more mid- and long-term JGBs and increase the reserve target by around Y10 trillion,"" said dovish former BOJ official Mitsuhiro Fukao. He thinks the BOJ should target CPI rises of 2% to 8% over three years. 

  The BOJ now limits the size of JGBs it can hold to the outstanding amount of banknotes issued. 

  ""The BOJ should get rid of that limit and flood the banking system,"" said Fukao, a Keio University professor. 

  If that doesn't work after a year, he says, the BOJ ought to go for broke and buy other assets such as certain stock indexes or real estate investment trusts. 

  ""I think the time is near when the BOJ should go ahead with these drastic measures,"" Fukao said. 

  BOJ officials, in fact, aren't saying never. 

  ""If the (BOJ and the market) can agree that the situation is so critical that taking such a reckless step is necessary, then we can go ahead and by stocks or land,"" one BOJ official said. 

  ""We wouldn't take such a step unless the economy paints an ultra-bleak picture"" said another. ""But nonetheless, it is an option."" 

  That might just happen. 

  The economy continues to head south and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's promised structural reforms - curbing government debt and cleaning up the wobbly banks - will only hurt demand and inflame deflation in the short run. 

  ""As long as the government is shrinking fiscal spending, there will always be pressure on the BOJ to ease,"" said economist Masaaki Kanno at JP Morgan Chase Asia. 

  Market watchers generally don't expect the BOJ's next move right away. 

  But, then again, they didn't expect the policy board to budge Tuesday, either.

220,"Mueller Upbeat On German Econ Prospects - Handelsblatt

 
 

  DUESSELDORF (Handelsblatt)--In an interview with Handelsblatt, German Economics Minister Werner Mueller painted a relatively upbeat picture of the prospects for Europe's largest economy. 

  ""We are seeing a turnaround in the fortunes of both the Dax-30 leading-share index and the euro, and inflation is likely to fall below 2% by the end of the year,"" he said, noting that a decline in inflation is needed to spur consumer spending and give leverage to the country's tax reform. Germany's inflation rate in July was 2.6%, down from 3.1% in June. 

  Mueller said the real problem is that signs of an economic upturn are not being properly heeded. ""The signals cannot be heard or seen if people have closed their eyes and ears,"" he said. 

  As examples of positive developments whose significance is being underestimated Mueller pointed to the situation in the construction industry. After two years of dramatic decline, the industry has now clearly seen the worst, he said. 

  And where, as at present, company's stocks are running down to the point where they need to be replenished, this is surely a clear sign that production is set to take off again, Mueller added. On top of that, there are industries, such as car assembly, that continue to boom. 

  ""There's sufficient dynamism there for real growth in gross domestic product of up to 3% in the first half of 2002,"" Mueller said. For this year, he forecast growth of 1.5%. 

  ""Essentially, we are seeing a repeat of the situation we had in 1999/2000,"" Mueller summed up. The full-year GDP growth for 1999 came out at 1.4%, short of expectations, but then the growth started to accelerate.

221,"AWSJ(9/7) WEEKEND JOURNAL: Mortgage Web Sites Can Take The Pain Out Of HomeLoans

 By Eric Bellman 
  Staff Reporter 

  Last year it took Lili Teo and her husband three weeks going from bank to bank to find the best mortgage rate. ""It was a waste of time,"" recalls the Singapore department-store administrator, who was forced to wait in long lines and often had to return more than once because she didn't have all the right documents. Last May they found a better rate in three minutes by using an Internet site, saving them $6,300 in the first five years. 

  Yes, even after the dot-com crash and in the middle of a global slowdown, there's still a way to make money off the Internet: refinance your home. As interest rates tumble, opportunities for refinancing abound. And banks are working harder than ever to woo the average homeowner to compensate for a dwindling number of corporate clients. In Hong Kong, competition has become so intense that banks have lowered mortgage rates faster than the central bank has dropped its key rate. Average long-term floating mortgage rates there were around 1 percentage point above the prime rate three years ago; now, banks are giving home loans at close to 3% percentage points below prime. 

  ""Banks are shaving their (rates) quite quickly to keep their customers from walking down the street,"" to another bank, says Alistair Scarff, regional banking analyst at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. That's where Web sites come in. 

  The last time rates were this low few people were using the Internet. Then, someone searching for the lowest rate for a new home mortgage had to do it the old-fashioned way, by comparing newspaper ads and television commercials in order to calculate the savings. 

  Many Web sites allow you to compare the rates on offer from the banks in your area. Some sites even have tools to help you calculate savings. A few will even let you join forces with other borrowers to get better terms. 

  The Singapore-based dollarDEX.com Pte. Ltd. (www.dollardex.com) for example, posts refinancing rates from more than 20 banks covering Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. In Hong Kong, the range goes from 2.75% to 4.00% for the first year of a refinancing loan. That translates to savings of as much as $12,500 on that year's payments on a $1 million loan. 

  Of course, refinancing is more complicated than the rate for the first year. You have to consider the rate of your current loan as well as any fees or penalties you might incur if you cancel it. You also have to look at how the rates and restrictions on a new loan will change in the future. The better mortgage sites help you break down all these factors to find the best loan package without having to waste a weekend calculating what your monthly payments might be five years from now. 

  With online refinancing calculators you just plug in the rate you are paying now, the amount you want to borrow and the fees you expect to pay and they tell you how much money you would save, if any, by refinancing. Five minutes with the calculator on the Singapore site Propbuzz.com.sg Pte. Ltd. will show how you can save more than $500 a year for the next five years if you refinance a three-year-old loan for $200,000. 

  The better Web sites will also list special promotions from each bank so you can compare them. Lenders are giving out freebies these days like premium credit cards and fire insurance as well as waiving legal fees and other costs of applying for a new home loan. 

  With property prices slipping in Asia, it's important to refinance your loan as soon as possible. Richard Lai, director at dollarDEX.com, says the number of applications coming through his site has surged in the past two months on concerns about falling prices. If the value of a home falls to below the amount of money owed on the mortgage, any refinancing requires the homeowner to put up more money. 

  ""Those who are refinancing want to do it quickly, otherwise they won't be able to,"" Mr. Lai says. 

  Still, you have to be careful about the sites you use. Most property sites are little more than online real-estate ads and many have outdated information and old loan rates. We found a few with information and functions useful to anyone looking into refinancing.

222,"WSJ(9/24) Latin America May Suffer Most From Slowdown

 
  By Wall Street Journal staff reporters David Luhnow in Mexico City, Matt Moffett in Rio de Janeiro and Pamela Druckerman in Buenos Aires 

  Empty beaches in Cuba; thousands of pink slips at Brazilian airlines; idle assembly lines in Mexico's border boomtowns. Welcome to Latin America. 

  Perhaps no other region in the world will suffer more from the economic shock waves of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A U.S. economic recession would practically halt growth throughout the region, especially in Mexico, which sells nearly 90% of its exports to the U.S. Uncertainty caused by the attacks will also make it harder for Latin companies and governments to borrow the money they need to pay off existing debt and to invest. And with fewer foreign visitors, tourism will be stung everywhere from Baja California to Buenos Aires. 

  Like Wall Street, Latin America's financial markets have taken a beating since the attacks. Brazil's real is at record lows, and Argentina's stock market is at its lowest level in a decade. ""We're suffering contagion from the U.S. crisis,"" says Guillermo Ortiz, the head of Mexico's central bank. Latin America may have exported plenty of financial crises of its own in the past, including Mexico's ""tequila crisis"" from the 1994-95 peso devaluation. But this time, the financial earthquake is coming from an unexpected quarter: the world's bedrock economy. 

  Following the attacks, the Inter-American Development Bank cut its forecast for regional economic growth this year by half, to a paltry 1%. Most economists expect Latin American economies to rebound only after the U.S. stages its own recovery, expected next year. Even before the attack, a slowing U.S. economy had stopped Mexico in its tracks after 7% growth in gross domestic product last year. Factories assembling TV sets and automotive parts for the U.S. market have laid off 100,000 workers in Ciudad Juarez alone this year, economists say. 

  The attacks came as Argentina's often turbulent debt crisis had reached a period of relative calm. Indeed, the region's governments have already raised the bulk of the estimated $13 billion in debt this year that they needed to refinance. Some Argentine officials even suggest the U.S. woes could make places like faraway Buenos Aires look safer. ""As a whole, I would think that local uncertainty is less than global uncertainty,"" says Mario Blejer, vice president of Argentina's central bank. 

  But borrowing next year could be difficult if the crisis drags on and investors run for cover. Since the attacks, the difference in average interest rates on Argentine and Brazilian government debt compared with those on U.S. debt -- a common measure of country risk -- has widened by about a percentage point. Acknowledging the powerlessness of policy makers in the current global environment, Brazilian Central Bank Governor Arminio Fraga said he has ""no rabbit to pull out of the hat."" 

  Companies expected to borrow in the coming months must wait, including anticipated deals like Mexican cement giant Cemex's $300 million offering of five-year debt. And companies with short-term debt could face trouble. The first warning shot came when Mexican auto-parts maker Corporacion San Luis SA skipped payment of $9.8 million on $200 million in debt. 

  Reducing perceptions of risk seems a priority. Mexico's top policy makers have agreed to push harder on a series of stalled reforms to the country's tax system and energy sector. Mexico's message to U.S. companies: ""Why go to a riskier country in a place like Asia when you can go next door to Mexico?"" says Mr. Ortiz. Even if Mexico manages to pass a tax reform to give the government more money, however, an upgrade of Mexico's debt rating by Standard and Poor's may not follow. 

  Tourism will suffer, too. Mexico takes in some $8 billion a year from visitors, and Cuba nearly $2 billion, more than half its foreign-exchange income. Taxis idling in wait for customers outside Havana's hotels are a bad harbinger for the island's communist regime, which has struggled to boost the economy since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Latin American airlines from Mexicana to Varig are shedding workers. 

  Oil is a wild card for regional players like Venezuela, where oil exports represent 40% of its total economy. Weaker demand in the U.S. and Europe could hurt oil receipts unless a Middle Eastern crisis cuts off key Persian Gulf supplies. Indeed, oil prices are already dropping from the panicky spike that followed the attack. Benchmark prices are now below their pre-attack levels.

223,"Rivlin: US Fed Risks Exhausting Ability To Boost Economy

 
 

  By Joseph Rebello 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--A former top Federal Reserve official warned Wednesday that the U.S. central bank risks running out of ammunition in its fight to boost economic growth if it cuts interest rates too rapidly. 

  Alice Rivlin, a Fed vice chairman for three years until June 1999, said she would favor a cut in the federal funds rate of just a quarter-percentage point when the Fed's top policymakers next meet Oct. 2. Most economists predict a half-point cut in the central bank's key interest rate, which would leave the rate at 2.5%, the lowest level since the early 1960s. 

  ""The Fed has to begin worrying about how fast it wants to move the fed funds rate down, because it wants to preserve the ability to keep doing (interest-rate cuts) longer,"" Rivlin said. She spoke at a panel discussion on the country's need for additional economic stimulus in the wake of devastating terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon on Sept. 11. 

  The Fed has cut the funds rate eight times this year, lowering it by 3.5 percentage points in what has been its fastest campaign of rate cuts in decades. The cuts have had little visible effect on the economy, which stalled in the spring and may have been tipped into a recession by the attacks. 

  The Fed, as a result, has said it is inclined to cut keep cutting rates. In addition, it has pumped unprecedented sums of money into the banking system. 

  Rivlin predicted the Fed will continue to cut interest rates. But she said the central bank now may need to avoid large cuts. ""The Fed doesn't want to get into the situation of the Bank of Japan, where interest rates are zero and there's nothing more they can do,"" Rivlin told reporters after the discussion. She said that if she were a Fed policymaker debating interest-cuts next week, ""I think I might do a quarter""-percentage-point cut. 

  Congress and the Bush administration are right to consider additional ways to boost the economy, through a combination of tax cuts and spending increases, Rivlin said. But she said the government should carefully consider the nature of tax cuts or spending increases it makes. 

  ""The major rule is not to make this moment an excuse for everybody's tax or spending program,"" she said. ""If we have a good case for additional tax cuts, especially at the lower end, and additional spending, then we ought to do it."" 

  She said that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's estimate that the country may need an economic-stimulus package  worth about $100 billion - including $40 billion in funds to rebuild Wall Street and the Pentagon - was reasonable. ""A hundred billion is a nice, round number,"" Rivlin said. ""It's certainly a good place to start."" But she said that it will be hard to know how much money will be enough until more information is available about the damage caused by the attacks. 

  The stimulus, Rivlin said, is unlikely to cause the economy to overheat anytime in the near future. The depth of the U.S. economic slump, the rising unemployment rate and the decline in energy prices, she said, have defused any risk of inflation. ""I think we're in a non-inflationary situation for the foreseeable future,"" Rivlin said.

224,"AWSJ(9/24)Japanese Govt Starts Crackdown On Bad-Debt Problem

 
  By Peter Landers 
  Staff Reporter 

  TOKYO -- The terror in the U.S. has delivered a big shock to Japan, the world's weakest economic giant. But events last week suggest that Japanese leaders are beginning to see it also as an excuse to make tough decisions that will help the nation break out of its funk. 

  The government on Friday announced a new crackdown on banks' bad loans, which are at the heart of Japan's decade-long economic woes. The policy calls for tighter inspections of banks and more attention to ""market signals"" - a veiled reference to plunging stock prices and credit ratings of troubled borrowers such as supermarket chain Daiei Inc. 

  ""We will greatly tighten our assessment of assets,"" said Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka, who is Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's point man for economic reform. Mr. Takenaka quoted Mr. Koizumi as telling a meeting of ministers, ""We are in the process of achieving what was thought to be unachievable."" 

  Such promises, of course, have been made before. In the past decade Japanese banks have consistently played down their bad loans, putting aside only minimal reserves even for loans to companies that were clearly on their last legs. Past governments, fearing higher unemployment and temporary economic pain, have encouraged or winked at this tactic. But it has left the economy overloaded with crippled companies too weak to do anything except go ever deeper into debt. 

  Mr. Koizumi might have an easier path than his predecessors, because he has made clear many times that his reforms will be painful and he still retains strong public support. The bankruptcy of retailer Mycal Corp. on Sept. 14, the second-largest nonfinancial bankruptcy in Japan's history, received favorable market reaction and little of the teeth-gnashing in the Japanese press that accompanied earlier big failures. 

  ""Barring strong public opposition, a bad-loan resolution looks more realistic than at any time in the past decade,"" Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., wrote in a note to clients. 

  Still, it's too early to say whether Mr. Koizumi can succeed, because many details remain unclear. The most important is how to use public funds to prop up the banking system. If banks conduct stricter assessments of their loans, many would have to record huge losses. Analysts say some banks could become insolvent as a result and most others will be undercapitalized. 

  Daiei, the supermarket operator, and some troubled construction companies are likely to be test cases of how sensitive the government is to ""market signals."" Daiei's share price fell 12% Friday, closing near a record low after it lowered its sales and profit forecasts. Daiei has more than two trillion yen ($17.23 billion) in interest-bearing debt and virtually no operating profit to repay its loans. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's credit rating Friday to Caa1, which means Daiei's bonds are in ""poor standing"" and in danger of default. 

  By the twisted logic of Japanese politics, Mr. Koizumi will have a better chance the worse the crisis gets. History has shown that Japan responds best when under severe duress - the most recent example coming in October 1998, when parliament passed a bank bailout to stave off a near-meltdown in the financial system. 

  The terror attacks in the U.S. may have also handed the Bank of Japan an excuse to wriggle out of a policy that was drawing intense criticism. The central bank has long resisted radical measures to eliminate deflation but is now beginning to adopt some steps advocated by critics because of the deteriorating global economy. 

  Several times last week the Bank of Japan conducted what is known as ""unsterilized intervention"" in currency markets as it sold yen for dollars. Normally when the bank sells yen it ""sterilizes"" the transaction by removing an equal amount of yen from circulation. In effect, unsterilized intervention means dumping a batch of new yen notes into circulation, the sort of monetary easing that proponents hope will create inflationary expectations among Japanese consumers. 

  The central bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, is a staunch foe of easing but his position appears to have weakened, in part due to attacks from a vocal group of ruling party legislators. ""The last 10 years of monetary policy by the BOJ have been a total failure,"" says Yoichi Masuzoe, a former politics professor who was asked by Mr. Koizumi to run for parliament in July elections and won easily.

225,"WRAP: Goodman Appoints New CEO, FY01 Profit Falls 4.4%

 
   By Ambereen Choudhury 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Goodman Fielder Ltd.'s (A.GMF) appointment of a new chief executive Friday eclipsed news of a 4.4% slump in 2000-01 net profit before one-time items for Australia's largest food ingredients company. 

  The company named former Southcorp Ltd. (A.SBG) Chief Executive Tom Park as its new head, effective mid-October. 

  This came as Goodman said profit before significant nonrecurring items for the year ended June 30 slipped to A$118 million, pressured by increased wheat and petroleum costs. 

  Including one-time items, Goodman recorded a A$78.3 million net loss due to a A$196.3 million restructuring charge as it looked to focus on its retail branded food businesses. 

  However, the profit before one-time items was within market expectations. Sales for the period gained 1.1% to A$3.22 billion. 

  Investment bank ABN AMRO upgraded Goodman Fielder to Add from Reduce following the appointment of Park. The investment bank believes his appointment will ""see an acceleration of business improvement. We were impressed with the improvements Tom Park made at Southcorp wines in the year he was there."" 

  Existing CEO David Hearn said earlier in 2001 he would depart before his five-year contract ended in 2003. Under Hearn's leadership, Goodman Fielder has whittled its operations to a core portfolio of branded businesses. 

  ""I love the food business, I'm thrilled to death to be back in it,"" Park told reporters. 

  Shares in the company ended up 1.8 cents, or 1.4%, at A$1.32. 

 
              Company Expects Better FY02 
 

  Turning to the latest earnings, Hearn said, ""The performance of our milling & baking business in both Australia and New Zealand was adversely affected by rising input costs, including higher wheat and petroleum prices."" 

  Still, Chairman Jon Peterson said the company is confident of improving its performance in the next 12 months. 

  ""At this early stage of the year, the business is trading satisfactorily, which gives us confidence that we will improve performance in 2002,"" Peterson said. 

  The company also said it expects to make A$90 million of cost savings in fiscal 2001-02. 

  In June, Goodman Fielder detailed a profit warning and, anticipating the market's negative reaction, said it would look for a new chief executive and accelerate restructuring plans to clean up before 2001-02. 

  The previously detailed sale of the company's Leiner Davis Gelatin business is moving through a regulatory process in the U.S., while the sale of the Germantown specialty ingredients business is expected to take place in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. 

  Goodman's Hearn reiterated that the company is keen to conduct a A$200 million share buyback, but that is mainly contingent on U.S. approval of the gelatin division sale. 

  One Sydney-based analyst said a delay in a much-expected share buyback is a minor disappointment. 

  In addition to the Leiner Davis and Germantown disposals, Goodman Fielder's restructuring plan included the integration in New Zealand of GF Milling and Baking, Bluebird and Meadow Lee into a single national food business. This was followed in Australia by the combining of Uncle Tobys and Meadow Lea into a ""billion dollar"" grocery business. 

  Goodman will pay an unchanged total dividend of 7.5 cents a share.

226,"Schroeder: EU Economic Support Plan May Be Needed In 4Q

 
   (This item was originally published Thursday.) 
 

  BERLIN (Dow Jones)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder held out the prospect of a European Union initiative to boost the economy even as he emphasized the need for budget discipline across the 15-member bloc. 

  At a press conference in Quedlinburg with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Schroeder indicated the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. could justify E.U. economic-support measures. 

  ""The task in the current situation is to observe the markets very closely, to see how the U.S., Japanese and European markets after Sept. 11 develop,"" Schroeder said. ""Then we'll see during the course of the last quarter of the year whether it's necessary to undertake something."" 

  Schroeder said any unilateral German economic-support measure would be pointless. ""We live in a globalized world, in global markets and so there's no sense in talking about any national programs,"" he said. 

  The comments follow the announcement this week of a U.S. government economic-stimulus proposal of up to $75 billion, in the form of tax cuts and new spending. 

  But the remarks also come amid relatively tight budget constraints on E.U. governments. E.U. members are committed under their 1997 Stability and Growth Pact to aim for budgets in balance or surplus in the medium term, and to ensure deficits don't exceed 3.0% of gross domestic product in any one year. 

 
   Budget Discipline Seen Key 
 

  Schroeder said Germany and its E.U. partners must heed the Stability and Growth Pact. 

  ""The agreed budget consolidation course in Europe must be continued,"" he said. 

  Those remarks come nearly two months after German Finance Minister Hans Eichel cast doubt on the E.U. budget pact, saying it didn't give states enough leeway to overshoot annual public-sector deficit targets during an economic slowdown. 

  Eichel, the architect of a budget-austerity program to tackle Germany's debt mountain, has since insisted he didn't intend to spark a debate about loosening the budget accord. 

  In any case, Schroeder appeared to rule out any imminent E.U. economic-support measures, in part because they could alarm the European Central Bank, which runs monetary policy in the 12-member euro zone. 

  ""In the current situation, I would advise against hasty announcements,"" he said. ""Hasty announcements could have negative consequences for the actors responsible for monetary policy."" 

  A German Finance Ministry official said the government remained committed to its austerity plan, which seeks to balance the federal budget by 2006 through steady cuts in new borrowing. 

  The official reiterated a ministry claim that new tax cuts and large spending programs couldn't be justified and downplayed the likelihood of any other economic-stimulus measures. 

  That said, the official didn't rule out the possibility of a modest E.U. economic-support initiative before the end of the year. 

  Many economists expect German real gross domestic product growth to slow to 1.0% or below this year, from 3.0% in 2000. The slowdown would result mainly from global economic weakness, particularly in the U.S., and recent high energy and food prices. 

  The Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. have diminished the chances of a German economic rebound later this year, and arguably have clouded the outlook for early 2002.

  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--New Zealand's third-quarter consumer price index rose an expected 0.6% from the second quarter, bringing annual inflation back under 3%, and giving the country's central bank the latitude to cut interest rates in November. 

  As expected, higher food prices were the biggest contributor to the quarterly CPI increase, making up over half the rise in the index. 

  Higher international agricultural commodity prices have pushed up domestic fruit, meat, vegetable and dairy product prices. 

  The food increase, plus rises in the prices of household construction, appliances and services, alcohol, and local authority rates, were partially offset by a fall in transportation costs due to airfare reductions and lower gasoline prices. 

  Annual inflation fell to 2.4% from 3.2% in the second quarter, which brings the CPI back within the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's official zero-to-3% target range. 

  The market was expecting a quarterly CPI rise of 0.6% and an annual increase of 2.4%, according to a Dow Jones Newswires poll of economists.

228,"Japan Govt Bonds End A Tad Up On Gloomy Econ Outlook

 

  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Japanese government bonds prices ended slightly higher Monday, thanks to small-lot buys prompted by further evidence of an increasingly gloomy outlook for the economy, traders said. 

  But as the fragility of the economy is already abundantly clear, gains were slim and most players stayed on the sidelines before an auction of five-year bonds Tuesday, traders said. 

  JGBs remained in positive territory throughout the session, following the release of miserable industrial production data before the start of trade, showing a worse-than-expected decline in September of 2.9% from a month earlier. 

  Further gains were limited after the Bank of Japan slashed its forecasts for economic growth and prices late in the session, predicting the battered economy may not crawl out of its present slump until 2003. 

  The BOJ's policy board cut its forecast for gross domestic product for the current year to March to a contraction of between 0.9% and 1.2%, down sharply from their April forecast of growth ranging from 0.3% to 0.8%. 

  Players said the downgrades weren't serious enough to encourage them to chase the market sharply higher ahead of a five-year JGB auction Tuesday, adding they were reluctant to risk seeing a 0.4% coupon, compared with the previous 0.5%, by pushing the five-year yield lower, traders said. 

  The lead December 10-year JGB futures contract ended only 0.03 higher at 140.60, after moving in a very narrow 14-sen range. The yield on the newest 10-year JGBs ended 0.5 basis point lower at 1.33%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

229,"Canada Sept CPI Seen Mild, Clears Way For Rate Cut

 
 
    By Paul Evans 
    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canadian headline and core inflation rates are both expected to have continued moderating in September, removing the last obstacle to an anticipated half-percentage-point cut in interest rates at next Tuesday's Bank of Canada rate announcement. 

  When Statistics Canada releases the September consumer price index data early Thursday, monthly all-items inflation  is expected to have risen slightly to 0.1% over August's flat reading, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Standard and Poors MMS in Toronto. 

  But the year-on-year gain for headline inflation is expected to ease to 2.5% from 2.8% the previous month, while the yearly CPIX measure - the Bank of Canada's preferred measure of core inflation - is forecast to have fallen slightly to 2.2% from 2.3% in August. 

  In the current climate of global uncertainties and concern about the likelihood and timing of a North American economic recovery, inflationary worries have all but vanished from the radar screens of Canadian markets and economists, leading most to believe the September data will be a non-event. 

  Since rising energy prices caused headline inflation rates to spike to a nine-year high 3.9% in May, headline and core rates have drifted gently downward on a path that the central bank and private analysts alike believe will lead the all-inclusive and core rates to converge by the end of 2001 around the 2% midpoint of the Bank of Canada 1%-3% inflation target band. 

  Analysts said that despite another upward jump in gasoline prices in September, the broadly-based subsidence of price pressures in the energy component of the CPI should still exert a noticeable downward influence on total CPI in September. 

  'We're still seeing headline inflation coming down very rapidly because of the unwinding in energy prices,' said senior economist Adrienne Warren of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. 'And core inflation really isn't doing anything right now - it's moving sideways, but I expect it will begin to drop lower in the next few months and into next year as the economy continues to slow down.' 

  Other analysts predict that another contributor to lower inflation rates in coming CPI data will likely be aggressive Christmas season discounting by retailers eager to boost fragile consumer confidence in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the unfolding U.S. anthrax scare. 

 
   BOC, Economists' CPI Forecasts Point To Lower Rates 
 

  All told, neither September's CPI data nor CPI reports in coming months are likely to deter the Bank of Canada from easing interest rates further to cope with the fallout from September 11 on an already faltering economy. 

  When it eased interest rates at the end of August, the central bank said it expected 'reduced pressures on production capacity and inflation through the rest of this year and into 2002,' and Bank officials have stuck to this view in subsequent statements. 

  On Tuesday, Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Malcolm Knight said in Toronto that the more pronounced economic weakening that has taken place since September 11 will keep inflation on a downward trajectory. 

  'World petroleum prices have recently been volatile, but assuming that on average they remain around current levels, overall CPI inflation should continue its recent downward trend,' he said. 

  Most economists have no trouble in subscribing to this view, along with its implication that inflation will be no impediment to continued Bank of Canada rate easing on Tuesday, and likely at the central bank's last rate announcement of the year on November 27. 

  Senior economist Marc Levesque of Toronto-Dominion Bank said that the September CPI data should be 'little more than a blip on the radar screen, given current economic conditions.' 

  'In any event, core inflation will remain close to the mid-point of the Bank of Canada's 1%-3% target band - leaving the Bank with all the necessary leeway to continue to cut interest rates,' Levesque noted in a recent commentary.

230,"AWSJ(10/22) Convention Business Is Battered In Asia

 
  By Cris Prystay 
  Staff Reporter 

  First, it was the British car dealers, then the European pharmacists. The bankers from Hong Kong were next. 

  About 80% of conferences booked at Hyatt International Corp.'s Bali Hyatt in November have been canceled in recent weeks, and general manager Brad Kirk is bracing for more. He is on tenterhooks waiting to hear back from 450 computer techies scheduled for a date early next year. 

  ""Absolutely nobody is confirming for the first quarter,"" he says. ""It's a pretty serious situation."" 

  Asia's multibillion dollar conference and exhibition business, already wobbly from the slowing global economy, is getting battered by America's war on terror. In Singapore, 24,000 hotel-room nights were left empty after the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, called off a five-day industry exhibition just one week before the start date. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.'s Sheraton Nusa Indah Resort in Bali lost half a million dollars in revenue when the World Bridge Championship pulled the plug, leaving a gaping hole of 2,700 room nights. The industry itself isn't immune: This week, the Association of Corporate Travel Executives called off its industry seminar in Kuala Lumpur on recession-proof travel management. 

  Corporate events are big business for hotels and other organizers in Asia. 

  Only four cities in the world played host to more international meetings in 2000 than Singapore, according to the Union of International Associations. Meetings, conventions and exhibitions contributed 1.13 billion Singapore dollars (US$624.3 million) to that economy last year. 

  In Bali, conferences account for 25% of Mr. Kirk's business, and 40% at the nearby Sheraton Nusa Indah Resort, which manages the Bali International Convention Centre. 

  The scratching of the Swift convention, which was slated to draw more than 6,000 bankers and finance professionals, has made the biggest splash so far. ""In 38 years of being in the business, I've never seen this large an event canceled just (a few) days out,"" says Robert Guy, managing director of Pacific World Destination Management Pte. Ltd., which coordinated the event in Singapore. 

  The board of Belgium-based Swift met after the Sept. 11 attacks, but opted to go ahead. Once bombs started falling on Afghanistan, the board changed its mind. ""It was the announcement that more (terrorism) was to come, anywhere, at any time, that did it. If something did happen, an important part of the world's payments community would be far away from where they needed to be,"" said Leonard Schrank, Swift's chief executive officer. Many financial institutions have slapped a ban on corporate travel, which would prevent delegates from reaching Singapore anyway. 

  A group of 15 hotels are now negotiating with Swift for compensation. ""We're trying to come up with an amicable solution, and we recognize our obligations,"" said Patrik Neutjens, director of the Swift International Banking Operational Seminar. Mr. Schrank estimates Swift's total loss, including the hotel settlement, refunded fees and lost preproduction costs, will come to about $10 million. 

  After Swift withdrew, Nat Wong scrambled to keep his own client from opting out. Mr. Wong, the CEO of Meeting Planners International Pte. Ltd., hired an emergency team of telemarketers to tell the 18,000 people who had registered for the International Textile Machinery Exhibition that despite the start of bombing raids in Afghanistan, it was safe to come ahead. 

  But that crisis was quickly overtaken by another: On Oct. 11, the Singapore government imposed new visa restrictions on travelers from five countries, including Pakistan, Iran and Egypt -- home to some 2,500 of the exhibition's delegates. After a meeting with government officials, Mr. Wong obtained approval the following Saturday morning for a visa waiver for his delegates -- just two days before the five-day event was to begin.  ""I was sitting in bed, on my handphone at 3 a.m. both Saturday and Sunday night,"" he says. ""It was absolutely crazy."" In the end, about 14,000 people, from 67 countries, turned up for the convention last week. 

  Conventions and exhibitions aren't the only casualty in the function business. In Malaysia, the inaugural Le Mans auto racing Series Race of Champions was postponed for ""international security concerns."" U.S. promoter Don King canceled a world heavyweight boxing title match scheduled for Beijing next month after broadcaster HBO, citing U.S. State Department advisories, expressed concerns about sending employees to China. 

  Even government conferences aren't unaffected. The Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting scheduled for Brisbane, Australia, from Oct. 6 to Oct. 9, was postponed after a large number of government leaders indicated they might not be able to come. Only 29 of 56 tourism ministers from Organization of Islamic Conference, or OIC, states turned up at a ministerial meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Oct. 12. 

  Event organizers are scrambling to cut deals with airlines and hotels to keep some of this business from drying up. The Sheraton Nusa Indah Resort is now offering 40% off for any group of 10 or more. Singapore-based Pacific World, which served as organizer for the now-scotched Swift exhibition, managed to win a 200-person convention that had canceled in Dubai after it wrung an extra 20% discount on pre-Sept. 11 prices from airlines and Singapore hotels. Singapore Exhibition Services Pte. Ltd., meanwhile, is pledging extra services, such as company visits and tailored seminars. 

  Another survival tactic is to target Asia-based customers, who have proved far more resilient than those outside the region. ""We're going to look at markets closer to home,"" said Mr. Guy, at Pacific World, which traditionally specialized on the long-haul corporate travel and convention market. 

  Singapore Exhibition Services, for instance, managed to draw a record 8,500 people to a three-day annual franchise exhibition that kicked off Sept. 19, just days after terrorists struck New York and Washington. Only 14% of that crowd came from outside Singapore. 

  In Bali, the handful of conventions that have kept their bookings have all come from within Asia, says Raymond Tait, director of sales and marketing for the Bali International Convention Centre. ""The long-haul market won't be as prevalent next year because people just don't want to go the distance,"" he says.

231,"DJ Oil Stocks -2: Shares Rebound After Morning Losses &gt;BHI

 
 
   By Lingling Wei 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Shares of oil drillers and service companies rebounded 
from morning losses Friday after the price outlook for crude oil was further 
muddled by Russia's refusal to acquiesce to the bigger output cut called for by 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 
  Russia, the second-largest oil exporter after OPEC, agreed to reduce its 
exports by 50,000 barrels a day for the rest of the year, a move which fell 
below OPEC's expectations. 
 
  The cartel ministers, who met in Vienna last week in hope of shoring up oil 
prices, have decided to put off planned production cuts until Russia, Norway 
and other non-OPEC countries join in. 
 
  Without a joint agreement, some analysts speculated that crude prices, having 
dropped 30% since mid-September, could fall to $15 per barrel over the next few 
months, while others projected a price level around $20 a barrel. 
 
  George Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co., said a larger 
production-cut agreement between Russia and OPEC remains possible in the next 
two to three weeks. 
 
  But even if that happens, Gaspar said, ""what the market is failing to 
recognize is that there is a considerable buildup (of oil production) among 
non-OPEC members,"" including Norway, Angola and Brazil. The capacity buildup 
could still result in a crude glut given the sagging oil demand amid the 
economic slowdown worldwide. 
 
  Gaspar estimated that non-OPEC members will produce nearly 2% more oil a day 
next year, further diminishing the cartel's grip on world oil prices. 
 
  Falling crude prices tend to discourage exploration and production companies 
from committing to long-term projects. ""Spending is going to be skinny in the 
first half of next year,"" Gaspar said, as compared with the projected 18% 
growth in overall capital expenditures by oil explorers and producers this 
year. 
 
  Kevin Simpson, an oil service analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co., wrote in a 
morning note that ""we assume that upstream capital expenditure will fall 7.5% 
in 2002, with the U.S. down 20% and overseas relatively flat."" 
 
  Simpson reduced his 2002 earnings estimates for 10 oil service companies, 
including Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI), Halliburton Co. (HAL), Schlumberger Ltd. 
(SLB), BJ Services Co. (BJS), Cooper Cameron Corp. (CAM) and Transocean Sedco 
Forex Inc. (RIG). 
 
  But Simpson said the lowered earnings forecasts are already priced into the 
companies' stocks. ""Investors are beginning to look past the near-term earnings 
trough to potential second-half cyclical recovery in assessing the oil service 
group."" 
 
  In recent market activity, many oil stocks rebounded from initial losses, 
with Transocean - earlier the biggest percentage loser in the sector - trading 
up 1.2%, or 33 cents, to $28.84, and Schlumberger up 0.6%, or 27 cents, to 
$47.48. 
 
  Industry leader Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) tacked on 1.5%, or 56 cents, to 
$38.44.

232,"DJ Georgia Has Cheapest US Gasoline Heading Into Holiday

 
 
 
  TUCKER, Ga. (AP)--Fred Lutz found a deal at his local gas pump Tuesday -a 
full tank of gas for his Cadillac at 88 cents per gallon. 
 
  ""I haven't seen that in a long time,"" the retired airline employee said. 
""It's astounding."" 
 
  Just in time for the Thanksgiving travel rush, Georgia is home to the 
nation's cheapest gas, with pumps statewide selling for less than a dollar a 
gallon and some suburban Atlanta stations offering prices as low as 79 cents. 
 
  That's made driving more attractive than flying for those making their 
holiday travel plans. 
 
  AAA Auto Club estimates 87% of those who travel this holiday will drive, the 
highest percentage ever. In the South, that means 8.7 million travelers are 
expected to drive 50 miles or more this week, slightly more than last November. 
 
  The average retail price of gasoline, including all grades and taxes, was 
about $1.23 per gallon Friday, according to the two-week Lundberg Survey of 
nearly 8,000 stations nationwide. Gas prices have plunged 32 cents since Sept. 
7. 
 
  A steep drop in Americans' travel and a supply glut have depressed oil 
prices, with producers reluctant to cut back, at least temporarily, experts 
said. 
 
  Georgia's break on gas prices stems from a variety of factors. It's excise 
tax on gas -7.5 cents per gallon -is the nation's lowest. Montana, at 27 cents 
per gallon, is highest. 
 
  Georgians also benefit from their proximity to a major pipeline that carries 
petroleum through Atlanta, said Dale Shuirman, motor fuel tax administrator at 
Georgia's Department of Revenue. 
 
  ""The longer you have to haul the product, the more transport costs you get in 
there,"" said Shuirman, who plans to ""buy as much fuel in Georgia as I can"" for 
his 750-mile round trip this week to Raleigh, N.C., to visit his son. 
 
  For many of those who couldn't drive, flying was a slightly fearsome 
proposition, according to a handful of travelers interviewed at Hartsfield 
Atlanta International Airport, the nation's busiest air hub.

AIG International Inc. Commodity Market Commentary 
Petroleum prices settled higher after trading substantially lower for the 
majority of the day.  Prices were pressured early this morning by indications 
that Russia will not reduce production in conjunction with OPEC and non-OPEC 
producers.  Short covering combined with forecasts calling for colder than 
normal temperatures supported natural gas prices. 
 
Livestock prices were supported by higher than expected wholesale beef prices 
which could potentially support higher cash values.  Short covering and 
expectations that colder weather might decrease live animal weights may have 
also supported the livestock sector. 
 
Soft commodity prices settled mixed today.  Sugar and cocoa prices settled 
slightly higher with light speculative and professional buying supporting 
prices. Cotton and coffee futures settled lower with profit taking and long 
liquidation before first notice day pressuring prices. 
 
Feed grains settled marginally higher today.  Corn prices were supported by a 
USDA report indicating that there will be slightly more feed demand from the 
live cattle industry.  While wheat prices were supported by continued rains in 
Argentina and follow through speculative buying after Friday's dramatic rally.

234,"DJ Fed&apos;s Poole Says Cannot Tell When Recession Will Trough

 
  (This article was originally published Tuesday) 
 
  ST. LOUIS, Missouri (Dow Jones)--Although noting that the U.S. economy is 
currently in recession, William Poole, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
St. Louis, said he was ""optimistic"" about the ""great strengths"" of its 
monetary, fiscal and banking situation. 
 
  He was talking to a business audience in St Louis, Tuesday in prepared 
remarks, entitled ""Financial System Robustness."" 
 
  Recalling that the National Bureau of Economic Research had announced Monday 
that a recession is under way and that economic activity peaked last March, 
Poole said, ""There is no way to tell now when the recession trough will occur."" 
 
  He said, ""We face many uncertainties, including the possibility of further 
terrorist attacks"", which, if they were to occur, would ""obviously be negative 
for the economic outlook."" 
 
  On the other hand, the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan ""seems to be 
going well,"" he said, while investigations into the anthrax attacks in the U.S. 
may also  yield results, in which case, ""success on those fronts would help to 
clear the air and would be positive for the economy."" 
 
  He cited strengths in the economy, including that banks are well capitalized, 
that ""inflation is low and expected to remain low,"" and that the federal 
government's budgetary  resources are adequate to meet new security needs 
following  the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He also noted that the Federal 
Reserve was already in rate-cutting mode before that  date. 
 
  ""There is no way to provide a reliable forecast of how quickly these 
fundamental strengths will show themselves in a clear revival of economic 
growth,"" Poole said. ""But they  will, within a matter of a few months or few 
calendar quarters,"" he said. ""Of that, I'm confident."" 
 
  Speaking earlier Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer had said 
that ""once the economy shows signs of moving to a rate of growth above trend, 
the Fed will have  to reassess the appropriate degree of stimulus and, at some 
point, begin the return to a more neutral policy."" 
 
  In Poole's case, much of his prepared remarks Tuesday focused on steps the 
Fed took in the period immediately following the September terrorist atrocities 
as temporary measures to provide ample liquidity to the banking system. Banks' 
capital ratios ""remain substantially higher than during the last period of 
major problems in the banking industry, in the late 1980s and early 1990s,"" he 
said. 
 
  He also said that, despite the huge insured losses expected from the 
destruction caused by September's attacks,  to his ""knowledge no insurance 
companies face the risk of insolvency from these losses."" 
 
  Poole is a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

235,"DJ Intl Finance Unites Vs Terrorism Amid Bleak Econ Outlook

 
 
   By Don Curren and Mike Esterl 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
 
  OTTAWA (Dow Jones)--A united attack on terrorist funding networks was the 
focal point of global financial talks here this weekend, suggesting that a 
tentative but potentially powerful consensus has emerged in the wake of Sept. 
11 attacks on the U.S. that have pushed the world economy to the brink of 
recession. 
 
  Finance ministers and central bankers gathered in Canada's capital agreed to 
pursue a coordinated attack on terrorist financing, and asked countries to put 
detection policies in place by Feb. 1. 
 
  ""These meetings made it clear that the international community will not be 
cowed by the events of the 11th of September,"" Canadian Finance Paul Martin, 
chairman of the Group of 20, said Sunday after three days of meetings involving 
the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and G20 countries. 
 
  Nonetheless, the IMF presented a sobering report on growth prospects in the 
wake of the attacks, slashing its global economic forecast for 2002 to 2.4% 
from 3.5% a month earlier. 
 
  Finance ministers, some of whom dubbed the IMF forecasts overly pessimistic, 
warned that developing countries are particularly susceptible to the slowdown 
as commodity prices fall, export markets shrink and investors become more 
risk-averse. 
 
  The G20 issued a resolution to pursue the possibility of debt standstill 
mechanisms for sovereign countries to avoid the ad hoc, often messy 
negotiations that have accompanied defaults and restructurings in the past. 
 
  Martin was among those recommending the creation of an international 
bankruptcy protection model similar to the Chapter 11 mechanism U.S. companies 
enjoy. The plan has opponents, though, including Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan, and IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler recommended a cautious 
approach. 
 
  The IMF did say it stands ready to provide additional financial assistance to 
developing countries during the current economic downturn. 
 
  But there was no indication that Argentina, teetering on the edge of default, 
would be getting any more bailouts from the official sector anytime soon. 
Instead, the recession-wracked country was encouraged to continue seeking a 
debt restructuring accord with private sector creditors, who hold $95 billion 
in bonds. 
 
  The three-day gathering drew a small but sometimes raucous group of 
antiglobalization protesters. The protests were not nearly as violent or 
disruptive as those at other global meetings, however, and had no impact on the 
proceedings. 
 
  G20 and IMF leaders emphasized the pledge to crack down on terrorist 
financing as a key development from the session, one that mobilized the 
resources of all of the world's largest economies and some pivotal developing 
countries. 
 
  ""It would have been understandable, at a time like this, (for countries) to 
have turned inwards and focus on their domestic concerns. But I believe today's 
meeting has been a reaffirmation of the importance of global cooperation,"" said 
Gordon Brown, chancellor of the exchequer for Britain and chairman of the IMF's 
 International Monetary and Financial Committee. 
 
  The plans ask member nations to ratify the U.N. resolutions dealing with 
terrorist financing and adopt such measures as creating ""financial intelligence 
units"" to monitor suspicious transactions and share information with other 
nations. 
 
  Although the G20 and IMFC plans both require member countries to provide 
technical and even financial assistance to other countries that need it, none 
of the officials were willing to attach a cost to the initiatives. 
 
  The IMF/World Bank meetings were originally scheduled for Washington in 
September. The G20 session was moved from India because of security concerns in 
the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.

237,"DJ Taiwan CPC, Formosa Petchem Mkt Shr To Fall On Oil Dereg

 
 
 
  By Xu Yihe and J.R. Wu 
 
  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
 
  SINGAPORE (Dow Jones)--Taiwan's oil market deregulation, which went into 
effect Wednesday, will hit the island's only two oil refiners, eroding their 
market shares next year, analysts say, but new players to the oil import 
business will benefit from being able to import cheaper feedstocks. 
 
  Sales of oil products by Chinese Petroleum Corp. (Q.CPC) and Formosa 
Petrochemical Corp., which currently monopolize Taiwan's oil market, will fall 
20% next year as abundant supply amid dented demand and prices further prompt 
price wars in the business, analysts say. 
 
  But deregulation should give a boost to the bottom lines of companies ready 
to venture into the oil import business, such as normal paraffin maker Ho Tung 
Chemical Corp. (Q.HOC) and oil container and warehouse operator Pan Overseas 
Corp. (Q.PO). 
 
  Ho Tung's earnings per share could rise to NT$2 next year from around NT$1.40 
this year as it imports cheaper kerosene, an upstream raw material for use in 
producing normal paraffin, a detergent chemical. That means in the first half 
of 2002, Ho Tung's share price could climb to NT$25, from Wednesday's close of 
NT$19.50, said Julian Chen, an analyst at National Securities in Taipei. 
 
  In anticipation of more oil imports into Taiwan, Pan Overseas could enjoy 
increased business as foreign oil importers need somewhere to store their 
products, analysts note. The company's stock, which ended Wednesday's session 
at NT$9.10, has an upside of nearly NT$11, Chen said. 
 
  According to the Petroleum Management Law passed by the Legislative Yuan in 
September, the government will allow non-oil companies with storage facilities 
able to store oil for consumption for 60 days, or registered oil sales of 
50,000 kiloliters in the last 12 months, to engage in the oil import business 
beginning Jan. 1 next year. 
 
  The deregulation of oil product imports is partly aimed at increasing 
competition in the mostly state-dominated domestic oil market. Taiwan began 
allowing non-state oil companies to import fuels other than gasoline and diesel 
in January 1999. 
 
  An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said the government doesn't 
expect the new law to spur a building spree of oil storage facilities in the 
short term, because investment in such an area is subject to approval from 
local governments regarding land use and environmental protection concerns. 
 
  ""Building such facilities involves complicated approval procedures,"" he said. 
 
 
       CPC Won't Reduce Refinery Runs 
 
 
  Still, the likelihood of reduced sales of oil products on the heels of 
deregulation doesn't mean Taiwan's largest oil refiner CPC will reduce 
operations or cut its oil throughput next year. 
 
  ""We will maintain our operation at 80-90% next year and there are no plans to 
reduce production,"" a CPC spokesman said, adding that the company is 
considering exporting oil to China. 
 
  With Taiwan's economy expected to show a mild recovery in 2002 from an 
expected first-ever annual contraction this year, analysts say demand for oil 
products will likely underpace supply. 
 
  Indeed, the domestic supply of diesel already outstrips demand by around 
20-30%, said Chen at National Securities. 
 
  He pointed out that the 2,000 or so gas station outlets dotting Taiwan now 
should shrink by one-fourth in two years as price wars force closures. 
 
  In the next six to 12 months, foreign oil imports are expected to seize about 
10%-15% of the domestic oil market share, said Michael Wang, an analyst at 
Polaris Investment Advisory Co. in Taipei. 
 
  The CPC spokesman said the oil refiner is seeking to export part of the 
surplus across the Taiwan Strait to the mainland, starting next year, as one 
way to ease pressure on sales as a result of competition from independent 
players. But such cross-strait trade is subject to government approval, he 
added. 
 
  CPC currently has about 70% of the domestic market share while Formosa 
Petrochemical, Taiwan's only private oil refiner, has the other 30%. Formosa 
Petrochemical will see its market share cut by about 5% after deregulation, 
Wang said. 
 
  Taiwan consumes about 10 million kiloliters of gasoline and 6 million 
kiloliters of diesel a year. The consumption rate has been growing at an annual 
average 3%, according to an official with Taiwan's Energy Commission. 
 
          New Market Players 
 
 
  Among the expected gainers post-deregulation are Ho Tung Chemical and Pan 
Overseas, which both meet the government standard for importing oil. 
 
  The two companies are expected to take a combined 20% of market share next 
year following deregulation, the official with Taiwan's Energy Commission said. 
 
  Ho Tung also owns oil storage tanks with capacity of 220,000 kiloliters in 
Taichung, central Taiwan. 
 
  Pan Overseas, which owns 30% in Taiwan Esso Petroleum Global Co., has 
invested NT$1.4 billion to build seven oil tanks in Taichung with total 
capacity of 215,000 kiloliters. The company has completed construction on five 
of the seven oil tanks. 
 
  Gas station chain operator National Petroleum Co. (Q.NPU), meanwhile, may 
have also a chance to import cheaper oil products, though it already is in a 
strategic alliance with Formosa Petrochemical, said National Securities' Chen. 
 
  However, the Energy Commission official said the Taiwan government hasn't 
received any applications from the two companies for oil import licenses.

  Fed Ready To Ease Again, Even Absent Enron Fallout 
  By Jennifer Ablan 
 
  The swan dive by Enron, the fallen-angel energy trader, will likely continue 
to reverberate through the credit markets this week and next, increasing the 
likelihood that the Federal Open Market Committee will cut short-term rates for 
the 11th time when it meets December 11. 
 
  The December federal-funds contract implied a 93% chance that the FOMC would 
trim its federal-funds target, currently at a 40-year low of 2%, by 25 basis 
points (one-quarter of a percentage point) and a 46% likelihood of a 
50-basis-point reduction -- twice the odds the futures market was giving a week 
earlier. 
 
  Comments that two voting FOMC members made prior to the Enron collapse made 
clear that another easing is on the table. On Tuesday, Fed board member 
Laurence Meyer said the central bank shouldn't be deterred from further rate 
cuts simply because rates have already been pushed to such low levels. The same 
day William Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed, added that ""the only 
stopping place is zero, and if going to zero is constructive, then we ought to 
do it."" The remarks came on the heels of Monday's confirmation by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research that the U.S. economy entered a recession in March. 
 
  While the financial markets discounted the official recession designation as 
old news, the statements by Meyer and Poole helped spur a sharp rally in 
Treasuries at midweek. Adding to the surge was news Thursday of a 
sharper-than-expected jump in the latest week's unemployment claims. The yield 
on the benchmark 10-year note plunged to 4.764% from Wednesday's close of 
4.948% -- the biggest daily decline since January, according to Salomon Smith 
Barney. ""I've never seen intraday volatility like this,"" notes Michael 
Schumacher, head of interest-rate product strategy at that firm.The 10-year 
note closed the week at a yield of 4.73% Friday, down from 5% a week earlier. 
 
  The November employment data, slated to be released Friday, should confirm 
that the labor market continues to deteriorate, he says. The consensus forecast 
calls for a 200,000 decline in nonfarm payrolls and a rise in the jobless rate 
to 5.6% from 5.4% in October. 
 
  Schumacher also notes that the two-year Treasury, the maturity most sensitive 
to Fed moves, has seen its yield soar to 2.83% from its bottom of 2.30%, ""and 
yet the economy hasn't shown any signs of bouncing back yet."" The equity 
market, for its part, points to a recovery with an 18% jump in the S&P 500 from 
its September 21 low. 
 
  ""I think this would be more important"" [than the collapse of Long-Term 
Capital Management three years ago], Larry Jeddeloh, chief investment officer 
of the TIS Group, which produces the Market Intelligence Report, says of the 
Enron fiasco. 
 
  ""That is likely why a bankruptcy filing is being delayed, and why there will 
be a ripple effect,"" he writes. ""The world over, a credit implosion is 
unfolding, in slow motion. Sabena Group, Swiss Air, two Japanese companies on 
Wednesday, Bethlehem Steel, Polaroid and now Enron have all folded or are 
folding in just the last 90 days. This matters."" 
 
  Tom Gallagher, political economist at the ISI Group, adds: ""There's certainly 
no systemic risk that would call for Fed intervention. But having said that, 
the discount window must be available for banks that have loans to Enron."" 
Moreover, the Fed is furiously pumping liquidity into the financial system. The 
ISI Group points out that the surge in money supply is looking a lot like a 
""Y2K liquidity repeat."" 
 
  Credit conditions haven't entirely deteriorated. Ratings of six U.S. banks -- 
including Citigroup, FleetBoston and Union Planters -- have been upgraded since 
the start of the fourth quarter, according to Moody's Investors Service. ""Core 
earnings have thus far remained strong enough to offset an increase in problem 
loans,"" it says. 
 
  But total U.S. rating downgrades thus far in the quarter have topped upgrades 
by 85 to 40. Among financial institutions, however, 14 upgrades have 
comfortably exceeded three downgrades, only one of which was linked to 
asset-quality deterioration. 
 
  Nonetheless, the Enron issue has made the markets nervous because of the lack 
of transparency about credits. 
 
  ""There could be something out there that certain people know because they 
were over the wall . . . bankers or companies,"" says Glenn Reynolds, chief 
executive officer at CreditSights. 
 
  ""We don't know the scope of the counterparty-risk issues and what exactly are 
the legal structures on those counterparty exposures, things like swaps and 
forex and plain vanilla,"" he continues. ""But what else is going on with the 
creative structured deals that they have not fully disclosed, such as the 
derivative issues?"" 
 
  With $13 billion in debt and, according to The Wall Street Journal, up to $17 
billion in derivatives contracts, says Reynolds, ""we clearly haven't seen the 
last of the Enron hits taken by the banking sector and by energy traders."" 
 
  Already, the hits have been crushing. Enron's 6 3/4% unsecured debt due 2004 
was quoted at 20 bid, 24 asked Thursday, down from bid 47 on Monday. The debt 
was quoted 83-85 on November 9, when Dynegy announced its merger agreement with 
Enron, then rated high-quality investment grade before falling to high-yield 
""junk"" status on Wednesday. 
 
  Enron's bank debt has been spiraling in similar fashion. Its unsecured bank 
debt, ranked on par with the bonds, is quoted at 19-19 1/2, while the secured 
bank debt is not trading actively. ""It's almost impossible to find a fall like 
this for a leading industry benchmark like Enron,"" Reynolds says. 
 
  So-called vulture investors, which specialize in buying distressed debt, have 
been flocking to the debt of Enron. If a company undergoes restructuring or 
bankruptcy, holders of the bank debt or the claims stemming from the bank loans 
that finance the company get paid first on whatever money the company has. If 
there's any money left after that, holders of the company's bonds are next in 
line. Equity holders stand at the end of the queue. 
 
  Vulture investors buy big stakes in the debt of bankrupt or ailing companies, 
which gives them leverage during a reorganization. Their debt securities may be 
converted to equity, which can yield juicy profits when a restructured company 
emerges from bankruptcy. 
 
  In the past year, many companies have seen prices on their bonds plunge long 
before bankruptcy or default seemed imminent. That's created a ballooning 
supply of distressed debt, generally defined as bonds with yields 1,000 basis 
points or more above comparable Treasuries. 
 
  CreditSights estimates the distressed-debt universe at about $250 billion, 
which includes bonds in default plus bonds trading with a yield-to-maturity of 
greater than 20%. ""You are going to see a lot of investors involved in Enron 
and they will retain counsel looking at legal structure; looking at 
residual-value estimates; evaluate time to clear bankruptcy, what the legal 
rights to different classes of creditors are,"" says Reynolds. ""This is the 
mother of all vulture research projects."" 
 
  The risk-reward symmetry -- what the assets of Enron are worth versus how 
much capital vultures will pay -- is compelling enough to attract vultures, and 
""this is what they live for,"" he adds. 
 
  Third Avenue Funds' Marty Whitman, one the biggest vulture investors in the 
market, says at some point he will buy the debt of Enron. ""I don't have to 
understand too much if I am a secured lender, but there doesn't seem to be much 
anywhere around here,"" he says. ""I don't think we will have that much of a 
problem appraising the assets, but getting our arms around what the liabilities 
are, all of this off-balance-sheet stuff, will be difficult."" 
 
  The financial markets certainly seem to agree.

239,"DJ Welteke: Productivity, Not CPI, Key For Wage Talks -Press

 
 
 
  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Negotiators in Germany's coming round of wage talks 
should take productivity as a guidepost but shouldn't consider inflation 
compensation, as the European Central Bank will keep prices stable, Bundesbank 
President Ernst Welteke told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 
 
  ""Wage negotiators can be certain that (the European Central Bank) will keep 
prices stable,"" said Welteke, who is a member of the ECB's governing council. 
""Therefore, (wage negotiators) would be well advised to come to agreements 
around productivity and not to push for an inflation compensation."" 
 
  An advance copy of the interview, to be published Saturday, was available 
Friday. 
 
  In addition, the paper quoted Welteke saying that ""wage agreements should be 
designed so as to help unemployed people become people with jobs."" 
 
  IG Metall, the labor union that represents 3.6 million workers in Germany's 
metals and electronics industries, will announce Monday its recommendations for 
the regional wage talks. The industry's wage agreement expires end-February. 
 
  IG Metall Vice President Juergen Peters and several regional union 
representatives have already said they will ask for wage rises of 5%-7%. This 
accounts for productivity gains, price rises and also includes a component for 
higher profit distribution. 
 
  Peters said earlier this week that, taken together, productivity gains and 
price rises comprise 4%-4.5% of the union's wage increase demand.

240,"DJ Poll Shows Argentines Back Dollar Peg;Also Expect Default

 
 
 
  BUENOS AIRES (AP)--As debate heats up on whether recession-plagued Argentina 
should adopt the mighty dollar, devalue its peso or try both measures, a poll 
published Sunday showed more than three-quarters of Argentines want the peso 
kept at parity with the dollar. 
 
  But as the government signaled it was leaning toward dollarizing South 
America's second-largest economy, an increasing number of influential 
economists want the peso to float freely. 
 
  Local polling firm Ibope said 75.6% of Argentines wanted to keep the 
one-to-one rate between the peso and the dollar that brought price stability 
since it was introduced in 1991. 
 
  Only 17.4% disagreed with maintaining the one-to-one rate. 
 
  According to Ibope, 59.2% of 1,200 people polled in 56 localities across the 
country believed it was ""probable or very probable"" that Argentina would 
ultimately default on its $132 billion debt. About 38% said Argentina would 
honor its payments. 
 
  No margin of error was reported. 
 
  Four years into a crippling recession, Argentina is being forced to consider 
alternative monetary policies. 
 
  The dollar peg has brought stability, but it has also helped make Argentine 
goods more expensive than goods from neighboring Brazil, which has a floating 
currency. 
 
  Anxious not to fall back into the years of hyperinflationary chaos that 
preceded the peg, Argentines and the peg's inventor, Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo, are reluctant to ditch it. 
 
  But after the International Monetary Fund cut Argentina off from bailout 
funds last week, officials are starting to mull a change. They could dollarize 
the economy, devalue the peso or introduce a combination of the two. 
 
  All major newspapers carried opinions laying out the various options over the 
weekend. The leading newspaper Clarin ran a front-page headline: ""Government 
advances with idea of dollarization."" 
 
  But inside, analyst Ismael Bermudez wrote ""dollarization won't resolve the 
basic problems"" of price competitively and expensive loans. 
 
  In any case, he wrote that the Central Bank's current $9.2 billion dollar 
reserves wouldn't cover the 11 billion pesos currently in circulation, meaning 
the government would have to devalue the peso before dollarizing. 
 
  In La Nacion, another respected daily, former Central Bank Governor Javier 
Gonzalez Fraga wrote that government inaction meant the financial system was 
bleeding $1 billion a week, despite a Dec. 1 partial banking freeze that only 
allows Argentines to withdraw $1,000 a month from accounts. 
 
  ""We must float the peso now!"" he wrote. Parity, ""like all drugs, isn't easy 
to kick once the positive effects have worn off.""

241,"DJ After A Long Wait, Taiwan Joins The WTO

 
  GENEVA (AP)--Taiwan formally joined the World Trade Organization on Tuesday, 
ending years of negotiations that were as often political as they were 
economic. 
 
  The island becomes the 144th member of the body that sets rules on 
international trade, less than a month after its huge neighbor China joined. 
 
  The Jan. 1 date was chosen by the Taiwanese deliberately  to make 
implementation of new laws and regulations easier. To become a member of the 
body that sets rules on international trade, Taiwan had to agree to amend 
legislation, lower import tariffs in some areas and improve access to its 
markets for foreign companies. In return, Taiwanese companies hope for 
increased opportunities abroad and consumers hope for lower prices. 
 
  Taiwan's membership was long held up because of an understanding reached in 
1992 that China would join first. 
 
  Beijing claims that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory,  and at first 
objected to Taiwan's joining at all. It was finally agreed that Taiwan could 
join because it is a separate customs territory with different rules on 
importing  goods. It will not be regarded as a country in its own right. 
 
  Completion of the agreement on Chinese membership took more than 15 years. 
China and Taiwan were both finally approved for membership in a blaze of 
publicity during the WTO's meeting of trade ministers in Doha, Qatar, in 
November  but, even then, Taiwan was approved a day after China. 
 
  China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing considers the 
island to be a breakaway province to be reunited with the mainland, by force if 
necessary. 
 
  Taiwan held the China seat at the United Nations until 1971, when the U.N. 
General Assembly voted to oust the Taiwan government and replace it with the 
mainland People's Republic. 
 
  China's opposition to Taiwan's status as a country in its own right has 
blocked its membership of the United Nations and other international bodies, 
but Beijing has made  exceptions for bodies that deal exclusively with economic 
issues.

  THE POLISH ZLOTY: Major stop-loss orders lurk above PLN3.90 to the euro and any break through this level would put the euro in a new trading range of PLN3.90-PLN3.96, says BPH Bank. Many investors are seen waiting for the central bank's interest rate decision next week before taking new positions. 

  The zloty weakened against both the euro and the dollar Thursday, despite a strong start to the session by the Polish currency. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at PLN3.8995, from PLN3.8870 late Wednesday. The dollar was at PLN3.0050, from PLN2.9910. Trading was quiet, with most investors apparently done for the week ahead of the rate decision, which will be accompanied by the first commentary from the bank's new Governor Slawomir Skrzypek. 

 

  THE HUNGARIAN FORINT: Dresdner Kleinwort sees the Hungarian central bank cutting interest rates later in 2007, but says that risk is on the side of hikes before then. While the prospect of rates remaining higher for longer should ultimately prove forint-supportive, there is a risk of forint weakness in the near term, the bank says. 

  The forint weakened against the euro Thursday, despite a firm start. A trader said that Fitch's rating of Hungary's eurobond helped to support the forint early in the day. Rating agency Fitch late Wednesday assigned Hungary's EUR1 billion, 10-year eurobond a 'BBB+' rating. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at HUF254.85, from HUF253.35 early Thursday and from HUF254.30 late Wednesday. The euro came close to breaking through resistance at HUF255 Wednesday. 

 

  THE CZECH KORUNA: Traders see the euro continuing to rebound against the region's currencies Friday, following losses earlier in the week. 

  The koruna weakened a tad against the euro Thursday, in line with currencies across the region. There was little reaction to the Czech National Bank monetary policy board's decision Thursday to leave interest rate unchanged, in line with market expectations. Analysts expected the bank to keep its monetary policy on hold amid tame inflationary pressure.    In December, the country's annual inflation rate was 1.7%, up from 1.5% in November. The central bank's key two-week repurchase rate stands at 2.50%. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at CZK28.160, from CZK28.110 late Wednesday. 

 
FIXED INCOME 
 

  POLISH BONDS: Focus is on the central bank's interest rate meeting next week, with investors unlikely to take new positions ahead of this. ""We expect market players to wait for next week's rate-setting meeting and the new inflation projection of the central bank,"" says Calyon Bank. 

  Polish government bond prices were little changed Thursday, after a volatile, low-volume session. Bond prices strengthened early in the day, boosted by a firmer zloty and by weaker-than-expected German Ifo data. German business confidence fell unexpectedly in January, with companies' assessment of their current environment less positive than in December, the Munich-based Ifo research institute said. 

  By midday, Polish bond prices had recovered most of the losses posted over the previous two sessions, with yields falling across the curve. But by the end of the day, prices moved back, with yields towards the short end of the curve ending unchanged from late Wednesday. 

  Late Thursday, the average yield on the two-year bond was unchanged at 4.41% late Wednesday. The five-year bond yield was also unchanged, at 4.85%, while the 10-year yield was at 5.16%, from 5.14%. 

 

  HUNGARIAN BONDS: Volumes are set to remain thin and trading uneventful Friday, a trader says. 

  Lehman Brothers says the continued slowdown in Hungarian retail sales growth - demonstrated by data released Wednesday - is encouraging, suggesting that the government's fiscal measures have started to erode consumer demand. This should also be reassuring for the central bank, which is concerned about potential second-round effects of the expected surge in inflation, the bank adds. 

  Hungarian adjusted annual retail sales growth continued to slow in November due to lower demand for both food and nonfood products. 

  Regarding the upcoming appointment of a new central bank governor, Lehman Brothers believes Hungary's Andras Simor could be politically more acceptable than former central bank head Gyorgy Suranyi, who is also seen as a candidate. 

  Speculation continues about when the appointment will be made. The prime minister will announce the new governor after the ruling Socialist Party's congress Feb. 24-25, national daily Magyar Nemzet reported Thursday. 

  Hungarian government bond prices firmed Thursday, despite a weakening of the forint in late trade. Yields dropped across the curve. Late Thursday, the three-year bond yield was at 7.80%, from 7.92% late Wednesday. The five-year bond yield was at 7.50%, from 7.53%, while the 10-year yield was at 7.00%, from 7.07%. 

 

  CZECH BONDS: The market is likely to take a breather Friday, following volatile trading Thursday, says Ceska Sporitelna trader Petr Kaspar. ""In all I think there's now room for a little correction (in price terms),"" said Kaspar. 

  Czech government bond prices weakened Thursday, after spending much of the session seesawing either side of flat. Late Thursday, the average yield on the 10-year bond was at 3.90%, from 3.87% late Wednesday.

  IN WARSAW: Stabilization seems the most likely near-term scenario after losses Thursday, a trader says. 

  The WIG20 index ended down 0.8% at 3398.87 Thursday after massive profit-taking on a number of stocks took the market down at the end of session. TVN ended down 5.6%, while Prokom was down 4.8%, Bioton down 3.4%, BZWBK down 2.9% and BRE down 3.8%. Bucking the trend, KGHM ended up 2.2% in a rebound from recent losses. 

 

  IN BUDAPEST: Traders are downbeat about the Hungarian pharmaceutical sector after drugmaker Egis issued a profit warning Thursday. Egis blamed slack sales in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States for lower-than-forecast first-quarter profit. 

  Fellow Hungarian drugmaker Richter said Thursday that it sees no need to adjust its earnings projections for this year. 

  But Raiffeisen trader Akos Herczenik says: ""Bad news is coming from Russia and the CIS, exactly where Richter expects its largest growth potential to come from."" 

  The strengthening forint will also bite into Richter's financial results, he adds. 

  A second trader called the profit warning ""very brutal"" and said there was ""raging pessimism"" regarding pharmaceuticals in the wake of the warning. Another trader said that the selling pressure could persist for days as both pharmaceutical stocks are rather illiquid. 

  The BUX index ended down 0.6% at 24066.03 Thursday as Egis and Richter fell in the wake of the warning. Volumes were high. ""The Egis announcement was the only negative news today but it set the tone for the entire market,"" the trader said. Egis ended down 2.4%, while Richter was down 2.6%. At this price, Egis shares are attractive, says Wood & Co. MOL weathered the day well, ending up 1.4% on the back of rebounding oil prices. 

  One trader said he expects the BUX index to continue falling Friday as ""MOL alone won't be able to turn the entire market around,"" with further heavy selling possible over the next two weeks. OTP ended down 2.3% as weakening regional currencies put pressure on the banking sector. 

 

  IN PRAGUE: With no significant scheduled domestic news Friday, the PX index is expected to track movements on core international stock exchanges. A correction is possible Friday, if U.S. stock markets weaken, traders say. 

  The PX index ended up 0.9% at 1675.4 Thursday. CEZ was the most heavily-traded gainer, ending up 1.1%. Among other gainers, CETV ended up 1.3%, Erste Bank up 1.3% and Telefonica up 2.1%. Gains were driven by a steady bullish mood, a trader said. Zentiva was the most heavily-traded faller, ending down 0.6%, as investors sold the region's drug stocks amid Egis-prompted concerns about slowing sales growth of generic drugs in Russia, where most regional drug makers used to enjoy solid gains. Other losers included Komercni Banka, down 0.6%, and Philip Morris, down 3.2%. ECM and Pegas, the index's newest members, both ended lower, down 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in very thin trade.

243,"DATA VIEW: Korean Current Acct Surplus Falls, Outlook Gloomy

 
       By Jung-Ah Lee 
       Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  SEOUL (Dow Jones)--South Korea's current-account surplus narrowed sharply in December and in 2006 as higher prices for oil and other commodities pushed up the value of imports and as more Koreans traveled overseas. 

  The Bank of Korea said it expects the current account to deteriorate further in 2007 to its weakest point in 10 years. 

  Economists say the deteriorating performance adds to other recent weak economic indicators, which will encourage the central bank to keep policy steady and not tighten despite its concern about a property sector bubble. Indeed, housing prices seem to be stabilizing in the wake of the government's recent measures to cool the property sector. 

  The current account surplus narrowed sharply to a seasonally adjusted $600.5 million in December from $2.46 billion in November. That meant that the surplus for 2006 totaled just $6.09 billion, less than half the revised $14.98 billion surplus in 2005, the central bank said Wednesday. 

  In unadjusted terms, the surplus fell to $146.7 million from $4.24 billion in November. 

  The Bank of Korea predicts the current account surplus will narrow further to just $2 billion in 2007 as the service account deficit is likely to widen. The service account includes foreign travel, shipping costs and companies' overseas businesses. 

  Economists agree with the central bank's forecast. 

  ""Export (growth) is likely to decrease to a single-digit this year, while the service account deficit won't likely improve in one or two years time as the stronger local currency will further encourage Koreans to travel overseas,"" said Lee Sung-Kwon, an economist at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. 

  Lee expects that the dollar will continue to weaken against the won, exacerbating these trends. He forecasts the dollar will average KRW938 in 2007 after averaging KRW955.1 last year. At 0230 GMT, the dollar was quoted at KRW942.05. 

  Korean financial markets weren't much moved by the data, which was in line with expectations. 

  The dollar was only down slightly from KRW942.50 Tuesday, while the yield on benchmark five-year treasury bonds was last at 5.01% compared with 5.05% yesterday. 

  ""The (sharply lower) current account balance could have a psychological effect, but its impact should be only marginal as such a deterioration has been widely anticipated"" due to the nation's already widening service deficit, said a trader at a local bank. 

  The service account deficit widened to $18.76 billion last year - the biggest services deficit ever recorded - from $13.66 billion the previous year largely due to a rise in shipment costs and an increased number of Koreans traveling overseas. In December, the service account deficit widened to $1.88 billion from a revised $1.43 billion shortfall in November. 

  Despite a double-digit growth in exports, the goods trade surplus narrowed to $29.21 billion in 2006 from $32.68 billion in 2005, due to higher prices for raw materials, including oil. 

  Exports rose 14.5% to $325.7 billion last year. In December, exports climbed to $28.87 billion from $25.63 billion a year earlier. 

  Exports were largely led by strong demand for petroleum, machinery, steel and ships. 

  Imports increased 18.4% to $309.3 billion in 2006. In December, they rose to $27.50 billion from $24.19 billion a year earlier. 

  The income account deficit narrowed to $538.6 million last year, from a $1.56 billion deficit in 2005, due to an increased returns of overseas interest payments, the central bank said. The income account surplus widened slightly to $285.0 million last month from $236.3 million in November. 

  South Korea also saw $18.62 billion of capital flowing into the country in 2006, compared with a $4.76 billion capital inflow in 2005. 

  The capital account surplus for December rose sharply to $5.46 billion from $436 million in November.

  BRASILIA (Dow Jones)--Amid concerns over a creeping acceleration of inflation and signs of a warming economy, Brazil's central bank is expected to slow the pace of interest rate easing at its monetary policy meeting Wednesday, a Dow Jones Newswires survey showed. 

  Among forecasts from analysts at 18 financial institutions, 12 said the bank would cut the reference Selic rate a quarter percentage point, while six saw a half-point rate cut. 

  ""Even though there's a general perception that inflation will remain under target this year, price pressure in the first quarter favors a more moderate stance by the central bank,"" noted Newton Rosa, economist at SulAmerica Investimentos in Sao Paulo. 

  With a cut, the Selic would reach its lowest level since the bank established its Copom monetary policy committee in June 1996. 

  The bank has reduced the rate by 6.5 percentage points since September 2005 to a current 13.25% annually, with 10 half-point cuts and two cuts of three-quarters of a point each. 

  Speculation over a shift to a slower pace of easing gained strength in November, however, after the central bank's rate policy committee split in its decision, with three of eight members voting to cut the Selic rate by only a quarter point. 

  Since that time, further indicators have suggested continued cause for caution. 

  While Brazil easily met its inflation target in 2006, posting an annual rate of 3.14%, monthly IPCA consumer price inflation rose to 0.48% in December from 0.31% the previous month, coming in slightly ahead of market estimates. Additionally, core inflation rose during the month to about 0.4% from around 0.25% the previous month. 

  Rising domestic food, fuels, and transportation costs were seen as responsible for the price pressure, which some observers see possibly spilling into further data going forward. 

  The short-term increase, meanwhile, caused analysts to revise inflation projections upward for the coming 12 months. 

  According to the central bank's latest market surveys, the IPCA index is seen rising in 2007 to 4.07%. The government has set targets for IPCA consumer price inflation at 4.5% this year and next. 

  Additionally, Brazil's industrial production rose by 0.8% in November, far surpassing market expectations and suggesting the economy could be seeing the first signs of heating due the central bank's long string of interest rate cuts. 

  Beyond those indicators, some analysts have also cited other domestic factors that could be taken into consideration at the rate meeting, including a wide ranging economic stimulus package that is scheduled for release this week. 

  ""The rate committee will likely reduce the rhythm of rate cuts now to evaluate during the coming month what impact the package will have on the economy,"" said Walter Machado, President of Brazilian Institute of Financial Executives in Sao Paulo. 

  Still, for other observers it remains unclear to what point the central bank will allow concerns over recent inflation to influence its rate decision amid pressure for accelerated economic growth and favorable factors on other fronts, including falling international oil prices. 

  ""With expectations of declining inflation, low sovereign risk, low oil prices, low GDP growth, high investment growth and a higher interest rate than the international financial arbitrage rate, it is difficult to justify a smaller reduction of the Selic at the Copom meeting,"" argued Jose Marcio Camargo analyst at the Sao Paulo based Tendencias consultancy in a recent research note. 

  Following his re-election to a second four-year term in office in October, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for a target to increase Brazil's economic growth by 5% annually. 

  Brazil posted annual economic growth of 3.2% in the third quarter of 2006. 

  Meanwhile, according to the central bank's latest market surveys, economic growth likely ended 2006 around 2.7% and is seen expanding to 3.50% in 2007. 

   The same surveys show the Selic rate falling to about 11.75% annually by the end of 2007.

245,"RATE FUTURES REPORT: Expectations Steady As Data Awaited

 
    By Jesse Thomas 
    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--For the first time in more than a week, interest rate futures prices Tuesday didn't settle lower, breaking a trend of the market reducing its expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate this year. 

  However, despite a weak data report released Tuesday, Eurodollar futures prices settled mostly flat, a signal that market participants are showing little conviction in pushing prices higher ahead of inflation data reports and speeches from Fed officials due later in the week. 

  ""The market, right now, has no interest in rallying,"" said Howard Gussis, an independent Eurodollar floor broker. 

  A report from the New York Federal Reserve on the area's manufacturing activity provided support throughout Tuesday's session to Eurodollar futures, which had settled lower on Friday for the sixth-straight session. 

  The New York Fed's Manufacturing Index dropped to a reading of 9.13 in January, compared with a revised 22.19 in December. The consensus among 11 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was for a January reading of 20.00. 

  Immediately following the report, Eurodollar futures prices climbed, indicating increased market expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year. Yet, prices struggled to post gains by the end of the session. 

  ""There's just not a strong conviction that this market's going to go higher,"" said a market source in the Eurodollar options pit, adding that when prices do move up, ""traders are quick to take profits,"" which sends prices lower. 

  ""The bigger question is the inflation numbers starting tomorrow,"" he said. 

  The Labor Department is due to release the December producer price index at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) on Wednesday, followed by the December consumer price index at 8:30 a.m. EST on Thursday. 

  Both reports are watched closely by the Federal Reserve and seen as key measures of inflation. Market participants agree that the two reports - known as PPI and CPI - could sway the market, in either direction, with more authority than was seen Tuesday. 

  Also Thursday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify on the fiscal and economic outlook before the Senate Budget Committee in Washington. 

  Gussis put it simply, saying, ""Bernanke's always big."" 

  The downward price trend throughout last week in Eurodollar futures was a result of comments from Federal Reserve officials who cited inflation as their primary concern, along with data reports that suggested economic strength. 

  At Tuesday's close, the June Eurodollar contract priced in a 48% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee reduces its key target rate from 5.25% to 5% in the second quarter. Those odds are unchanged from Friday; markets were closed Monday. 

  For the third quarter, the September Eurodollar contract at Tuesday's close showed a 92% probability for a 5% rate, also unchanged from Friday. The market fully expects 5% by year's end, along with a 40% odds for 4.75%. The FOMC has held the rate at 5.25% at its last four policy-setting meetings. 

  Eurodollar futures, traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are commonly used by traders to bet on short-term U.S. interest rate expectations, although they are actually linked to three-month projections for the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. 

  For longer-dated contracts, Treasury futures tied to longer-maturity bonds at the Chicago Board of Trade saw moderate price gains in Tuesday's session as contracts lifted off their 2-1/2 month lows seen at Friday's close.

246,"WSJA(1/2) China&apos;s Oil Hunt Heats Up Abroad

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) 
   By Shai Oster 

  BEIJING -- China's private entrepreneurs are joining its big companies in striking abroad to search for oil to satisfy their nation's insatiable thirst, in the latest sign of how the world's fastest-growing major economy is roiling energy markets. 

  Perhaps the most successful of this new breed of wealthy Chinese wildcatter is Ni Zhaoxing, a 50-year-old businessman who has spent the last year prospecting for oil in western Canada after amassing a fortune in China's real-estate market. Mr. Ni's ZhongRong Group has struck oil in its Saskatchewan field, a find that eventually could bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue a year, based on his projections. 

  China has been encouraging its big state oil companies to go abroad for years, aware that domestic oil fields don't have enough supply to meet growing demand in China. Government-run companies including China National Petroleum Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. have bought oil and gas fields in Central Asia, Africa and the Americas. 

  That push -- often into countries such as Sudan or Iran that have troubled ties with the U.S. -- coupled with China's stated aim of improving its ability to use armed force abroad to protect its global interests, has raised alarms in Washington and other capitals. Western politicians and oil executives worry that Asia's state-owned oil companies are trying to lock up the world's resources in a bid to boost their nations' energy security. Some analysts counter that Chinese oil companies are actually spending only a fraction of what their western peers are in acquiring overseas oil fields. 

  Mr. Ni's efforts are incidental by the standards of those giants and their foreign Big Oil counterparts. But even in its early stages, the emergence of private-sector oil developers in China's state-dominated industry illustrates both the country's growing obsession with energy and the rise of its entrepreneurial class. It also shows how, amid today's high oil prices and tight supplies around the world, even small-time players with no experience or expertise believe the search for oil can be lucrative. 

  China has become more dependent on energy exports amid rapid industrialization and the rise of a middle class snapping up cars, as well as flat-lining production from its domestic oil fields. Its demand for oil is expected to reach 7.4 million barrels a day in 2007, up from 7 million barrels in 2006 and 35% ahead of the 5.5 million barrels in 2003. But its domestic supply this year is expected to be just 3.7 million barrels a day, only slightly more than the 3.4 million barrels a day it pumped out in 2003. 

  Private Chinese companies are looking well beyond Canada to fill the gap, to places such as Indonesia and Ecuador. In April, 40 such companies traveled to Pakistan and signed deals to develop oil fields, refineries, pipelines and coal mines worth a total of more than 10 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), according to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. 

  The highest profile member of that delegation was Gong Jialong, chairman of Great United Petroleum Holding Co., a consortium of several dozen private Chinese companies involved in small-scale oil production and refining. One of Great United's biggest shareholders is Guangcai 49 Holding Co., whose directors include Charles Zhang, chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Sohu.com Inc., one of China's biggest Internet companies. Mr. Zhang couldn't be reached for comment. 

  Mr. Gong also heads China's Chamber of Commerce for Petroleum Industry, a group of about 1,000 private oil companies that is lobbying for fewer government restrictions in China's heavily regulated domestic oil market. Mr. Gong's future was thrown into question by his detention last month on suspicion of unspecified economic crimes. His detention was disclosed by Tianfa Petroleum Co., a listed company he controls. 

  Another Chinese oil entrepreneur is Cui Xinsheng, chairman of the China International Petroleum Investment Union, a group that includes investors from China as well as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Singapore. The group has paid about $400 million for rights to four fields in Indonesia and two in the Middle East. It hopes to sell the rights to China's big state-owned companies, Mr. Cui says. 

  Mr. Ni started off running a small village-owned construction-materials factory near the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou in 1980. After early success with the factory, he moved to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, then an emerging economic hothouse where China's leaders were testing capitalism. Mr. Ni says he was repeatedly swindled by business partners in Shenzhen, losing almost all his money. 

  He persevered, though, setting his sights on the rough-and-tumble real-estate market with the founding of ZhongRong in 1992 -- just as China's property market was getting ready to take off. ZhongRong blossomed, too. Among its current projects are a 43-story building in Shanghai's financial district and a collection of 78 neoclassical villas in the mountains west of Beijing, called in a promotional brochure a ""royal Xanadu."" 

  Mr. Ni now has a net worth estimated at $190 million. He says the assets controlled by ZhongRong, which he and his wife own, are valued at around $770 million. 

  Mr. Ni says he first got the idea to invest in energy during his early-morning newspaper reading. ""I saw there was a need,"" he says in an interview at ZhongRong's Beijing office, a restored former bank in the city's prerevolutionary diplomatic quarter. ""We have a responsibility to increase the world's resources, either by conserving energy or finding more,"" he says. 

  Despite China's obvious need for more oil, regulators at first balked at granting ZhongRong the permission necessary to convert the $30 million needed for its investment in Canada from Chinese yuan. ZhongRong eventually prevailed, and in 2005 began buying Saskatchewan tracts that eventually totaled 15,000 hectares. 

  Trevor Dark, assistant deputy minister of petroleum and natural gas at Saskatchewan Industry and Resources, says ZhongRong's subsidiary has licenses to drill six wells over a 12-month period in the Weyburn region. Canada Capital Energy Corp., the ZhongRong subsidiary set up for the project, says it has found oil in two wells so far, but has not said how much they are producing. The company says its goal is to reach a production rate of 20,000 barrels a day in five years. That would be valued at about $438 million a year at today's prices. 

  China's big oil companies haven't always been welcomed overseas. State-run Cnooc's bid to buy California-based Unocal in 2005 was defeated in part because of fears China was trying to lock up oil resources at America's expense, a charge Cnooc denied. 

  Mr. Ni's reception has been better. ""We're very pleased,"" says Mr. Dark. ""We're absolutely happy for more firms from China to invest in Saskatchewan."" 

  Mr. Ni says China's growing oil demand has fueled the soaring prices that attracted him to the business. But he says his investment has nothing to do with China's political agenda, or an effort to secure resources for the motherland. ""I'm an investor,"" he says. ""Not just a Chinese investor. I'll sell the oil where I find it.

247,"WSJA(2/12) Insurers Target Developing World

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) 
   By Ian McDonald, Liam Pleven and Eric Bellman 

  JHALAWAR, India -- Last year, global insurance giant American International Group Inc. opened a garage-size office in this dusty town of about 50,000. Coming up soon here: a policy that insures a cow for a $10 annual premium. 

  Seeking potential sources of future growth, AIG and its international rivals are racing to sell insurance in the developing world, from sprawling markets like India and China to smaller ones like Romania and Nicaragua. In remote areas, insurers must teach the concept of insurance to populations who have never bought any. Sometimes, as in parts of northern Uganda, the local language doesn't even have a word for it. 

  To penetrate these markets, insurers are devising unusual policies, charging as little as 50 cents to insure everything from television sets to burial costs. They are forgoing conventional documentation requirements, sometimes selling life insurance to people who don't know when they were born. 

  Instead of relying entirely on agents, AIG and many others are partnering in some markets with nonprofit microloan programs, operations that lend small amounts of money to the poor. Many microlenders sell a form of life insurance that will pay off the loan and sometimes also compensate survivors if the debtor dies. AIG has roughly 2.25 million life-insurance policies on microloan recipients, mostly in Uganda, Mexico, India and Brazil. 

  Microlenders say selling insurance benefits borrowers by teaching them greater financial sophistication. It is a ""natural extension of our role,"" says Scott Graham, senior manager of strategic alliances for Washington-based Finca International, a nonprofit group that operates microlending programs in 21 countries. 

  Microlending won Bangladeshi banker Muhammad Yunus the Nobel Peace Prize last year. And just as big banks are being drawn to that business, big insurers are increasingly lured by what they call ""microinsurance."" It is a way for insurers to wedge themselves into new markets -- markets they see as crucial to the future of the industry, which in 2005 collected $3.4 trillion in premiums. 

  That year, insurance premiums world-wide edged up 2.5% from the year before, according to Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world's largest reinsurer. That is because half the total market is driven by the U.S. and Japan, where insurance is ubiquitous and growth opportunities can be limited. 

  In that same year, insurance premiums in emerging markets rose nearly 7% after inflation, more than three times the growth rates of developed markets, according to Swiss Re. Increasing car and home ownership in those countries are boosting demand, as is rapid economic growth. 

  ""The premiums are not very high, but selling these policies allows you to build up relationships with these customers as their markets develop, and that's going to be important,"" says James Schiro, chief executive officer of Zurich Financial Services AG, which sells microinsurance in four Latin American countries today and is launching a pilot program in South Africa sometime this year. 

  Ugandan Fred Adriko, 20 years old, didn't know his mother had insurance until she was killed in a car accident in 2005. She had taken out a microloan from Finca to develop a business selling produce and purchased a policy at the same time. 

  Because of the policy, Mr. Adriko received a payment of about $650, which he can use to take care of his family, he said in an interview through a Finca-provided translator. 

  AIG knows the benefits of getting in early. Former AIG Chief Executive Maurice R. ""Hank"" Greenberg, hewing to the style and approach of his mentor Cornelius Vander Starr, started building relationships with government and business leaders in China more than a quarter century ago, before the government allowed foreign insurers to sell policies there. 

  Today, AIG is the only foreign insurer allowed to have a wholly owned unit sell life insurance in China, a right it won in 1992. Other foreign insurers are piling into the China market, but they typically need to work with a locally based partner. 

  Emerging markets can present logistical and cultural hurdles as well as daunting local bureaucracies. What is more, since the premiums collected are small by Western standards, the revenue generated by the microinsurance sector also is tiny. While developing markets are profitable for a few companies, insurance executives say they remain unprofitable for many others. 

  AIG, which does business in about 130 countries, says its microinsurance business is profitable, but total premiums from life insurance sold to microloan recipients in developing markets add up to only about $45 million a year. That is just 0.15% of the $29.4 billion in life insurance premiums AIG took in world-wide in 2005. 

  Some insurers are sitting out the global rush. Northwestern Mutual, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, company that is among the U.S.'s largest life insurers, doesn't sell insurance abroad. The company relies on agents who aim to establish long-term relationships with customers, explains CEO Ed Zore, and ""I don't think we could"" build such a sales force in another country. Mr. Zore says the company may expand to other countries in the future. 

  The insurance race is particularly heated in India, which opened its market to foreign insurers in 2000. Not only does the country boast a young population and a British-influenced legal system, but it also is relatively virgin territory. The country's 1.1 billion people spend $21 billion on premiums, a little more than what 13 million Illinois residents paid for property-casualty coverage in 2005, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a New York trade group. 

  A number of the world's biggest insurers, including AIG and Aviva PLC, Britain's largest insurer, expanded into India in the past seven years. Allianz SE, a German insurance giant, says it has 180,000 full and part-time agents in India and is hiring 10,000 more every month. Britain's Prudential PLC, India's leading foreign life insurer in 2005, arrived even before the market opened to establish local ties. 

  India also presents some obstacles. As in China, local players are dominant. The Life Insurance Corp. of India boasts more than one million agents and collected well more than 90% of the country's life-insurance premiums in 2005, according to the Insurance Information Institute. 

  Under India's laws, all foreign companies must partner with locally based companies to sell insurance. India also requires that companies generate some of their business from the countryside, preventing insurers from focusing solely on the affluent urban customers they are often most interested in. 

  India stipulates that 5% of foreign insurers' premiums for property-casualty coverage must be generated by rural customers. Rural customers must represent 7% of all life insurance policies in the insurer's first year, a number that rises to 18% in its fifth year. 

  In rural India, in addition to using their own agents, both AIG and Aviva typically sell basic life-insurance policies through local women's groups and microlending agencies. This lowers distribution costs because the person processing the loan also sells and processes the insurance policy on the loan. 

  Finca, which works with AIG in many places but not India, says its local offices keep as much as 25% to 50% of the premiums left over after claims and expenses in some areas. In others, Finca's local offices get nothing. 

  Some companies working in India say married women are often their best representatives because they tend to stay in their community and know it well. That knowledge is helpful given how much insurers have relaxed traditional standards, accepting thumb prints on policy applications and eliminating death-certificate requirements, since few rural clients die in hospitals. In India, AIG says it accepts the signatures of a village elder or groundskeeper at cremation facilities. 

  Without local expertise ""we would be too scared to go into this market,"" says Sriram Gopal, head of the rural, nonlife insurance business for the Tata AIG Life Insurance Co., which is AIG's local joint venture with Tata Group, an Indian conglomerate. 

  To market its brand in rural areas, Aviva representatives tour villages and stage festivals in a promotional van festooned with a big loudspeaker. 

  In Nandurdi village -- a few brick and mud homes amid sugar-cane and grape fields five hours' drive from Mumbai -- roughly 200 villagers gathered recently to spin a giant wheel in hopes of winning key chains and pens. As they handed out the prizes, Aviva agents talked to the crowd about the value of life insurance. 

  The reps told the crowd that Aviva is the world's fifth-largest insurer and assured them that insurance isn't just for the rich. They asked villagers who would take care of their family if they died. 

  ""Who here has insurance?"" asked Aviva representative Sushil Gaykawad, and only about six hands went up. ""Who plans to get insurance now?"" he followed up. All hands went up. 

  To reach its core urban audience, Aviva plasters its logo on the clocks that count down to green lights at traffic stops in Delhi. It advertises during televised cricket matches, and, in 2005, Aviva paid for more than 2,000 airings of TV advertisements for the Bollywood family drama, ""Viruddh."" The movie ads ended with the India megastar, Amitabh Bachchan, saying the Aviva slogan: ""Kal Par Control,"" or ""Control Your Future."" 

  After four years in India, Aviva covers more than one million lives and operates 113 branches, says Vivek Khanna, head of Aviva's Indian operations. 

  Rival AIG has already written policies covering the lives of about 15,000 cattle. While local insurers pioneered cow coverage years earlier, those policies became problematic because of fraudulent claims. To avoid bovine fraud, AIG employs retired veterinarians who, armed with digital cameras, visit farms to verify a cow's death. The policy typically pays more than $200 when the animal dies.

248,"UPDATE: Euro-Zone Jan Services PMI 57.9 Vs 57.2 In Dec

  (This updates an item that ran at 0900 GMT with new sourcing, additional detail and analysts' comments) 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The euro zone's services sector grew at the most rapid pace in six months in January, while private sector companies raised their prices more aggressively than at any time since November 2000, a survey of purchasing managers conducted by NTC Research showed Monday. 

  The headline measure of activity in the services sector - the purchasing managers index - rose to 57.9 in January from 57.2 in December.    The rise in the PMI was unexpected. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires last week had forecast the PMI would decline to 56.7. A reading above 50.0 indicates a period of expansion for the sector, while a reading below 50.0 indicates a contraction. 

  The pickup in the services sector was broad-based, with activity strengthening in Germany, France and Italy. 

  However, a similar survey of purchasing managers published Thursday showed manufacturing activity slowed in January as exports were hit by the strong euro, so the composite PMI fell to 56.6 from 57.5. That indicates  the euro-zone economy continued to grow at a strong, but slightly slower pace as 2007 began. 

  The strength of the services sector relative to manufacturing also suggests that the composition of growth in the euro zone may be changing, with expansion becoming less reliant on exports and more reliant on domestic - including consumer - demand. 

  ""The euro's strength against the US dollar appears to have hit manufacturing exports, but this has been offset by faster growth in the service sector,"" said Ken Gaynor, head of economics at the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which sponsors the survey. ""This suggests that 2007 may see a changing growth dynamic from that seen in 2006, away from exports towards improved domestic demand in the euro area's main national economies, particularly Germany."" 

  Strengthening domestic demand makes the recovery less vulnerable to developments elsewhere in the global economy, for example a housing-led slowdown in the U.S. 

  But it may also mean that manufacturers and service providers feel more confident that they can raise prices without losing customers. 

  In January, private sector companies raised the prices they charge at the fastest rate since November 2000, when NTC first began compiling data on that component of the PMI. Although partly the result of an increase in Germany's sales tax rate, that is likely to cause concern at the European Central Bank, and increases the likelihood that the central bank will raise interest rates again in March, and possibly once more before the end of June. 

  ""The ECB will be concerned by the sharp rise in both the input prices and prices charged indices for the euro-zone service sector in January,"" said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. ""Reports of improved pricing power among service providers and higher wages will be particularly worrying for the ECB."" 

  Private sector companies reported that they continued to hire new workers for the seventeenth straight month, a development that suggests the pickup in domestic demand should continue.

249,"G7 Aims To Curb Carry Trades, Stressing Risk Of Yen Gains

 

  (This article was originally published Saturday) 

 

  By Paul Hannon 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  ESSEN, Germany (Dow Jones)--Finance ministers and central bankers from Europe and Japan Saturday launched a concerted effort to curb the growth of carry trades, which European officials believe have been a key factor in pushing the euro to record highs against the Japanese yen on the foreign exchange markets. 

  Carry trades refer to investments in assets denominated in high-yielding currencies that are funded by low-yielding currencies. With the Bank of Japan's key interest rate set at 0.25%, borrowed Japanese yen are nowa popularsource of cheap funding for those investments. 

  European expressions of concern about the yen's recent weakness and the role carry trades have played in pushing the euro higher against the Japanese currency fueled speculation in the foreign exchange markets that action would be taken at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven leading economies here. 

  The G7's final communique made no reference to the yen, but noted that Japan's recovery is ""on track and is expected to continue."" G7 members said they ""are confident that the implications of these developments will be recognized by market participants and will be incorporated in their assessments of risks."" 

  According to G7 officials briefing later, those statements were intended to draw investors' attention to the possibility that the yen will strengthen  and Japanese interest rates will rise as the recovery continues. That would threaten carry trades, since an appreciation of the Japanese currency would cut investors' profits. 

  In press briefings after their joint statement, some G7 finance ministers and central bankers highlighted those statements with coordinated language that made clear the yen-funded carry trade was their primary target. 

  ""We want markets to be aware of the risks in one-way bets in general,"" said European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. ""We, in particular, think of carry trades, but not only carry trades."" 

  At exactly the same time, but in a different room, Germany's finance minister delivered a nearly-identical warning. 

  ""We want to strictly stick to one language,"" Peer Steinbrueck said. ""It's the common view of finance ministers and central bankers that markets should be aware of risks stemming from one-sided bets, particularly on foreign exchange markets. This addresses the problem linked in particular to carry trades."" 

  Japanese Minister of Finance Koji Omi added his voice to the chorus. 

  ""Market participants ought to be aware that acting in one direction could bring a risk,"" he said, referring to some traders view that yen weakness is a sure bet. 

  Despite Steinbrueck's claim that all G7 members had signed up to the common phrasing, U.S. officials didn't speak about the danger of one-sided bets in general or carry trades in particular.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told reporters that as a general rule he doesn't believe he should ever comment on the value of freely-floating currencies or evaluate particular trading strategies. 

  The success of efforts to curb the growth of carry trades may depend on how consistently officials stick to the agreed message. European officials felt that their Japanese counterparts departed from an agreed position shortly after the last G7 meeting in Singapore in September, undermining their initial success in talking the yen higher. 

  An official at a European G7 delegation insisted the lesson from that experience has been learned. 

  ""Believe me, everyone will stick to the current wording, all parties concerned are fully aware of the risks, notably the Bank of Japan,"" he said. 

  The mix of an oblique reference in the communique and more direct comments in press briefings may reflect the G7's desire to avoid an overly dramatic reaction in foreign exchange markets. A more direct statement on the yen's value or Japanese interest rates - unlikely in the face of Japanese opposition and U.S. disinterest - could have risked a rapid unwinding of carry trades, sending assets prices into a spin. 

  Despite the immediate focus on the yen in response to European concerns about a loss of competitiveness in markets in which Japanese exporters compete with their European counterparts, the Chinese yuan remained an ongoing concern for G7 members. 

  In their communique, they said that ""in emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur."" 

  The G7 had previously called on China to allow the yuan greater flexibility to move in response to market forces. The more direct reference to movement in the exchange rate represents a departure from previous statements. 

  The G7 said it welcomed ""China's commitment to rebalance growth."" 

  China's strong record of economic growth in recent years has been driven by an investment boom and exports, while G7 members want the government to encourage stronger consumer demand as part of a shared effort to reduce trade imbalances. 

  U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Tim Adams described the change in language as a ""technical fix."" U.S. officials say their message to China hasn't changed, and they continue to believe China should allow the yuan to appreciate in the short term, and move to a freely-floating currency regime in the longer run. 

  However, European officials pointed out that while the yuan appreciated by 3.4% against the dollar last year, that was partly the result of the greenback's weakness. But the euro is now stronger relative to the yuan than it was when China ended its peg with the U.S. dollar in 2005, and linked its currency to a basket of currencies. In their view, the new stress on the ""effective exchange rate"" reflects the need for the yuan to strengthen against currencies other than the dollar. 

  The G7 sounded a generally upbeat note about the outlook for the world economy, noting that growth is more balanced. 

  ""The US economy is experiencing solid activity, while adjusting to a more sustainable growth path,"" the communique said. ""Canada and the UK remain on a strong and balanced growth path. The euro area is experiencing an increasingly broad-based upswing."" 

  They noted that with energy prices falling, inflationary pressures are ""moderating,"" although G7 central bankers said they said they will ""remain vigilant.""

250,"Signs Mount Of End Game For Zimbabwe&apos;s Robert Mugabe

  JOHANNESBURG (AP)--Signs are mounting that Zimbabwe is finally reaching the end game, witnessing the last, desperate throes of a regime that has destroyed one of Africa's few successful economies, forced a third of its people into the diaspora and the rest into poverty that is killing hundreds of thousands. 

  It may not happen Saturday, when President Robert Mugabe celebrates his 83rd birthday with bubbly and cake at a $1.2 million party while hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans struggle to survive on bread and water. 

  And it probably won't happen in the weeks leading up to April 18, the 27th anniversary of an end to racist white rule and Mugabe's ascension to power. 

  But years of abuse and neglect are culminating in untenable crises. 

  ""People's anger is mounting,"" said Zimbabwean political scientist John Makumbe. ""They're no longer afraid to go into the streets and I think the government is growing very afraid of what may happen."" 

  Hyperinflation that brings shortages of food, fuel, medication, electricity, is spiraling out of control. Opposition from within his ruling party, which is divided over the timing of his succession and his successor, is mounting. 

  ""Each and every individual on the upper echelons"" is jockeying for his position, Mugabe complained in an interview on his actual birthday, Wednesday, broadcast over the country's sole and state-owned television station. 

  But, he announced categorically: ""There are no vacancies because I am still there."" 

  Mugabe blames sanctions, drought and former colonizer the U.K. for the collapse of an economy based on exports of a wealth of agricultural and mineral products. 

  Others blame land grabs in which Mugabe encouraged blacks to violently force out most of the 5,000 white commercial farmers who owned 40% of all agricultural land and produced 75% of agricultural output. White farmers had employed the country's largest work force and their ejection led to the displacement of 300,000 families. 

  Today, the farms, most given to Mugabe relatives, allies and cronies, lie fallow and Zimbabwe doesn't have the foreign currency to import food. 

  On Mugabe's birthday, police announced a three-month ban on protests, following weekend clashes in which they fired tear gas and turned water cannon on opposition rallies. 

  The National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of human rights, church and grass-roots organizations, in a statement Friday said: ""It's not a crime to defend oneself from an unlawful attack, and if need be (people) should protect themselves from a partisan, violent police force that aims at perpetuating dictatorship and increasing the suffering of the ordinary masses."" 

  Mugabe is ""at war"" with the people, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai declared this week. 

  Opposition supporters wanted to protest the high cost of living and Mugabe's plan to extend his term of office to 2010. 

  A rate of hyperinflation - running at near 1,600% - that economists say soon will be represented by an upright line on a graph has the country in revolt. The number of Zimbabwe dollars that bought a three-bedroom house with a swimming pool and tennis court in 1990 today will buy one sole brick. 

  A lifetime public worker's monthly pension can't buy a loaf of bread. Charities have reported depression, suicide and malnutrition among retirees - including a type of vitamin deficiency affecting gums, bones and hair loss. 

  Doctors and nurses have been on strike since December and the rest of the civil service is threatening to join them. 

  The list of deserters on the walls of army barracks grows ever longer despite a 300% pay raise in January. The military want a 1,000% increase. The police chief in the capital, Harare, has said in a confidential memo that he fears his constables will riot. 

  A hairdresser paid the minimum monthly wage of $30,000 said her bus fare to work cost more but she went anyway to get the tips from clients that keep her and a daughter alive. 

  Political scientist Makumbe said a 16-year-old who broke his collar bone falling out of a tree has lain at home in pain for days because his widowed mother doesn't have the million Zimbabwe dollars needed to have the bone set. 

  Makumbe said an estimated 70,000 people have died this year not because of the doctor's strike but because there are no drugs and because medical equipment like dialysis machines doesn't work any more. 

  Bread disappeared off the shelves this week after the government increased the price of grain sold to millers by 10,000% but didn't increase the controlled price for bread. 

  Water shortages have brought a cholera epidemic that is killing people. 

  Children are among the first to suffer, with one in four Zimbabwean children orphaned and more than 2 million vulnerable to starvation, the U.N. Children's Fund says. 

  The government tries to control inflation by printing money and setting the exchange rate. Last year, when half a dozen eggs cost more than a million Zimbabwe dollars and the poorest Zimbabweans were millionaires, the government simply knocked three zeros off the currency. The minimum monthly salary for a house cleaner went from $15 million to $15,000. The official exchange rate is set at 250 to the U.S. dollar, but the real trading rate is 5,000 to the dollar. 

  Some Zimbabweans are getting rich off the misery. Party and government officials with access to foreign currency buy it at the official rate and sell it at the real rate. 

  The World Bank estimates it would take more than 20 years for Zimbabwe's economy to return to 1980 levels.

251,"UPDATE:CEA:China Yuan Policy May Not Change Its Export Prices

 

  (Updates with further detail.) 

 
   By Henry J. Pulizzi and Elizabeth Price 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--China's policy of depressing the value of its currency pushes domestic inflation higher, and leaves the relative price of goods the country trades unchanged, the White House said Monday. 

  ""Chinese intervention does not systematically change the relative real prices between the United States and China,"" the Council of Economic Advisers said in its annual economic report of the president. 

  China has been under heavy pressure from Congress and manufacturers to ease its tight grip on the yuan, which critics say undervalues the currency and gives Chinese products an unfair advantage in global markets. China's central bank buys dollars on foreign exchange markets each month to control the value of the yuan, also known as the renminbi. 

  According to Monday's report, the increase in China's inflation rate, spurred by the intervention, offsets any price declines resulting from the exchange rate movements. That conclusion suggests the intervention may have little impact on the U.S. trade balance with China, and raises the question of why the U.S. Treasury is devoting so much of its time and energy to persuading Beijing to allow the yuan to appreciate. 

  ""Fixing the nominal exchange rate does not tend to move countries away from purchasing power parity,"" the idea that identical goods and services should cost the same in different countries, CEA said. ""The only effect is that domestic goods prices have to do all of the adjustment since the exchange rate is fixed."" 

  CEA said there is no ""clear preference"" between conducting monetary policy with a fixed exchange rate or through short-term interest rates. 

  ""In the end, central banks that choose to fix the value of their exchange rate relative to another currency and central banks that choose to set a short-term interest rate are each choosing a different tool to conduct monetary policy,"" CEA said. 

  Though the panel said economic theory doesn't dictate a preference between the two systems, it said interest-rate targeting is the preferred tool because no major industrialized nation's central bank uses a fixed exchange rate. CEA Chairman Edward Lazear said the panel is ""agnostic"" on the issue. 

  ""Our goal in this chapter was simply to explain the effects of a variety of different strategies, and that's why we said we don't want to take a position on one over the other,"" Lazear said. 

  In July 2005, China officially ended its policy of pegging its currency to the dollar, moving to a system of managing the yuan against an unpublished basket of currencies. 

  Though the yuan has appreciated more than 6% since July 2005, U.S. exporters, lawmakers and the Bush administration believe it needs to rise further against the dollar. The Treasury Department is pushing China to let the yuan appreciate in the short term, and move to a freely floating currency regime in the longer run. The disagreement between Washington and Beijing is over the pace of reform. 

  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the White House's point man on the issue, told lawmakers last month that Beijing needs to take four steps toward floating the yuan. It must widen the currency's trading band, lower central-bank purchases of dollars, develop a bond market and create central bank policy targets to avoid inflation and boost confidence in the yuan. 

  ""China does not yet have the currency policy we want it to have and that it needs,"" Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee. ""China's cautious approach to exchange rate reform exacerbates distortions in its domestic economy and impedes the adjustment of international imbalances."" 

  Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries, meeting over the weekend in Germany, urged China to focus on the trade-weighted value of the yuan. ""In emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur,"" the finance ministers said. 

  Earlier Monday, the Chinese government said the country's trade surplus jumped 67% last month from a year earlier to $15.88 billion.

252,"WSJ(3/16) Currency Trading: Swiss Gift

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Joellen Perry 

  FRANKFURT -- Historically, Switzerland's currency has been the strong, silent type: The tiny nation's steady economy and peaceful geopolitics have long lured investors to the Swiss franc in times of global economic turmoil. 

  But lately the Swiss franc has started behaving more like the Japanese yen -- a darling of currency speculators who use it to fund risky investments across the globe. 

  The reason: Switzerland's extremely low interest rates of 2.25%. 

  Currency traders are borrowing massive amounts of Swiss francs, then investing that money in countries like Iceland, where the money earns higher interest rates of 14.25% -- a maneuver known as the carry trade. 

  Switzerland's low interest rates are also luring individual home buyers across Eastern Europe and as far away as Greece to take out Swiss-franc denominated mortgages. 

  All this has Swiss National Bank officials worried. If interest rates and investor sentiment changes, these often-complex carry trades could sour quickly and roil the economy of Switzerland and perhaps elsewhere. Last year when Japan indicated it might raise its superlow rates, the announcement rattled global markets as traders tried to adjust their strategies. 

  Yesterday, the SNB raised its base interest rate by a quarter-point to 2.25%. The SNB targets a range for the three-month franc London interbank offered rate, and aims for the midpoint of the range, now 1.75% to 2.75%. 

  Low Borrowing Costs 

  Still, Swiss borrowing costs remain the second-lowest in the industrialized world, after Japan's 0.5% rate. 

  The low Swiss interest rates, according to the bank, are still stoking growth in the domestic economy, where annual inflation in February was zero. But the carry trade raises concerns that local inflation could start galloping higher. 

  That is because one byproduct of the carry trade is to weaken the Swiss franc compared with other currencies. A weaker currency means Swiss companies and consumers must shell out more francs for imported goods. (The carry trade weakens the Swiss currency because essentially, speculators are selling it in order to buy, say, Icelandic kronur; all that selling pushes down the franc's value.) 

  Indeed, the franc is hovering near eight-year lows against the euro. It has also fallen nearly 10% against the dollar since 2005, putting the value of one Swiss franc at about 82 cents. A weak franc is good news for Swiss exporters, because it makes their products more affordable to buyers in other countries. 

  There are also concerns that the currency speculation could destabilize economies in Eastern Europe, where the sale of franc-denominated mortgages is booming. The risk is that any rise in the value of the franc would increase the debt burdens and mortgage payments for people whose earnings are in, say, the Hungarian currency, the forint. 

  ""We've tried to say, don't assume it's always going to be this way,"" says Philipp Hildebrand, a member of the Swiss central bank's board. 

  In addition, Swiss-franc loans often offer floating interest rates, which means debt burdens will spike if Swiss interest rates do. Mr. Hildebrand noted that the franc recently bounced back a bit against major currencies as worried global investors unwound some of their currency bets -- a small warning of what can happen. 

  Market estimates of the yen carry trade typically start around $200 billion, and increase from there. Though experts say the franc trade is smaller, in part because Swiss interest rates are higher, few doubt that hedge funds and currency traders could lose billions of dollars if the yen or Swiss franc suddenly rose in value. 

  Pain of Franc Spike 

  A spike in the franc also could break many ordinary borrowers' backs. With interest rates in the euro zone and many Eastern European countries outpacing Switzerland's, banks outside the country increasingly offer loans in Swiss francs. 

  ""It's like a carry trade for the household,"" says Michael Saunders, a Citigroup economist in London. He warns that typical carry-trade investors are steeped in the complexities of currency risk, and far more likely to protect themselves when engaging in currency bets than ordinary borrowers. 

  According to the Bank for International Settlements, which collects data from 40 central banks, the value of Swiss loans granted to companies or individuals outside Switzerland rose to $138 billion in the third quarter last year, from $61 billion in the same period of 2002. Economists suspect much of that increase was accounted for by these so-called household carry trades. 

  Austrians, who have been borrowing in Swiss franc since the mid-1990s, held 34 billion euros ($45 billion) of foreign-currency loans last December. Several banks in Greece started offering Swiss-franc mortgages last fall. Both Austria and Greece belong to the euro zone, where interest rates hit 3.75% last week and are likely to rise to at least 4% this year. 

  Eastern Europeans with historically volatile currencies have also recently embraced the franc. Hungarian households held about 6.6 billion euros of Swiss-franc debt last December, a jump of 87% from 2005. 

  Much as Switzerland's central bankers might like to raise interest rates further to make the carry trade less attractive, they are limited in what they can do. The bank targets a medium-term inflation rate of 2%, and inflation is at zero. 

  The bank's most recent forecasts, released yesterday, show inflation nearing the 2% target again in 2009, and markets expect another rate increase to 2.50% at the bank's next meeting in June. But with interest rates in many major economies high or rising as well, the Swiss franc looks unlikely to lose its allure for foreign borrowers anytime soon.

  Dollar Rises Against Yen 

  In Bumpy but Tight Trade 

 

  Meanwhile, in New York trading, the dollar was higher against the yen in a bumpy but range-bound session that shadowed U.S. equities and paid little attention to a spate of mixed, second-tier data. 

  But investors, nervous over U.S. subprime mortgage weakness and the U.S. economy in general, failed to make any big moves. 

  ""There was limited participation as the choppy moves of the last couple days discouraged people from being overactive in currencies,"" said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. 

  Late in New York, the dollar was changing hands at 117.56 yen versus 117.07 yen late Wednesday, while the euro stood at $1.3237, up slightly from $1.3229. The euro traded at 155.59 yen versus 154.63 yen. The dollar was at 1.2179 Swiss francs versus 1.2158 francs, while sterling was at $1.9369, up from $1.9362.

253,"Reserve Bank Of NZ Raises Cash Rate To 7.50%, Stays Hawkish

 

  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Thursday raised the Official Cash Rate to 7.50%, as widely expected, and left the door partly ajar for another hike as recent economic indicators show a clear pick-up in domestic demand. 

  ""Domestic inflation is projected to remain at high levels over the medium-term and is subject to considerable upside risk,"" RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said in the March Monetary Policy Statement. 

  The central bank expects the headline consumer price index to ""rise rapidly"" in 2008 to the upper part of its 1%-3% target band. 

  Notably, Bollard said that depending on the persistance of the current domestic upturn, ""further tightening may be required."" 

  New Zealand's Official Cash Rate had been at 7.25% - the highest in the  industrialized world behind Iceland - since December 2005. 

  Bollard said the current policy tightening was aimed at reducing the risk of an unsustainable rebound in domestic activity - at the expense of a rebalancing of the local economy that has been underway since late 2005. 

  ""Our concern is that the recent pick-up in housing and domestic demand may gain momentum, giving rise to a cyclical upturn at a time when resources are already very stretched,"" Bollard said. 

  He added that such an upturn would increase the prospect of a ""more costly correction"" in the country's current account deficit. 

  Thursday's decision was in line with economists' and market forecasts. Fifteen of 16 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected the RBNZ to raise rates by 25 basis points, while the Overnight Index Swap market had priced in an 86% chance of a hike. 

  The RBNZ raised interest rates nine times and by a total of 225 basis points between January 2004 and December 2005 to cool pricing pressures brought on by five years of robust economic growth. 

  While the pace of growth in New Zealand has been slowing since mid-2005, recent data have sent mixed signals on the health of the economy, with near-term inflation pressures abating, but housing and labor markets remaining stubbornly tight, retail spending resilient, and business confidence at multiyear highs. 

  New Zealand's on-year inflation eased to 2.6% in the fourth quarter from 3.5% in the third quarter to fall back within the RBNZ's 1%-3% target band. But domestic inflation, which excludes import prices, remains at an uncomfortably high 3.8%. 

  House price growth, a major concern for policymakers, moderated to 9% on year in January but failed to provide the clear slowdown sought by the central bank. 

  The RBNZ revised lower its short-term CPI forecasts to 1.9% for the first half of 2007 from its December forecast of 2.4%, and to 1.6% in the second half from 2.3%, due mainly to a higher New Zealand dollar exchange rate and lower gasoline prices. 

  However, inflation is expected to accelerate in 2008, hitting a peak of 2.7% in the first half of 2009. 

  ""A return to a moderating trend in housing and domestic demand will be essential if we are to see a reduction in medium-term inflation pressures,"" Bollard said. 

  He noted the central bank continues to assess alternative measures to support the official cash rate, such as a tightening of tax rules on housing investment and changes to bank capital requirements to moderate the ""amplifying effect of credit on the housing cycle.""

  Of Dow Jones Newswires 

  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--Colombian consumer prices advanced a higher-than-expected in February owing to a sharp hike in education costs and due to a strong increase in the food sector as dry and cold weather damaged crops, the national statistics department, known as DANE, said late Thursday. 

  The statistics department said consumer price index rose 1.17% in February, while a Dow Jones Newswires survey of nine economists had produced a median estimate of a 0.90% increase of the index. 

  Colombian consumer prices were up 5.25% in the 12-month period to February. 

  The sharpest advance in February came from the educational sector which accounts for 4.8% of the CPI measurement. With the start of the school year leading to higher tuition expenditure and books costs, prices in the sector surged 3.94%. 

  The closely watched food sector, which has a 30% weighting in the CPI, increased 2.11%, as prices of vegetables and fruits climbed sharply in February. 

  El Nino warm current in the Pacific Ocean has caused drought in several parts of the country and night frost in the region around Bogota over the past two months. 

  ""The data is madness,"" said Cesar Tovar, analyst at the local unit of Stanford Group. ""The market was an expecting a maximum of 1%,"" he added. 

  Tovar expects yields on peso-denominated debt to increase Friday as a result of the higher-than-expected inflation figure. 

  He added that the data could comprise this year's central bank's target range of 3.5%-4.5%. 

  The central bank may be inclined to keep increasing rates at a faster pace as a result of the data, Tovar added. 

  On Friday, the monetary authority decided to hike its benchmark interest rate to 8% from 7.75% to tame rising inflation pressures. That was the eighth time the central bank has raised its benchmark rate since last April, when it stood at 6%. 

  Alberto Ramos, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a report Friday that if the Colombian economy doesn't show signs of cooling off, the bank could increase rates to as high as 9%. 

  Colombian inflation rose 4.48% in 2006, in line with last year's target range of 4% to 5%.

255,"CHINA WATCH: Rate Hike Shows Beijing Favoring Market Tactics

 
   By Rick Carew 
 
   A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
 

  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--China's efforts to tame resurgent lending and investment won't stop at Saturday's interest rate hike and the central bank could soon back up its tightening with a second rate increase in coming months, economists said. 

  By raising interest rates, the central bank has put market-based tools back at the forefront of its battle against economic overheating. Most economists expect inflation, investment and other data in coming months to show economic growth momentum remains strong, encouraging further tightening. 

  Still, the People's Bank of China is unlikely to let up on other tightening measures, including bill sales, higher bank reserves requirements and administrative steps aimed at soaking up excess liquidity. The broad package of measures won't likely include a formal widening of the yuan's daily trading band against the U.S. dollar although the Chinese currency's appreciation trend could accelerate, economists said. 

  China's monetary policy, said Goldman Sachs analyst Hong Liang, is still ""far from where the neutral policy stance should be"" and the yuan's rise so far, including initial revaluation, isn't enough for China to regain monetary policy independence. 

  She expects another 27 basis-point rate rise in June or July, and a 7% rise in the yuan against the U.S. dollar over the next 12 months. 

  ""The symmetric hike suggests the PBOC no longer considers it necessary to protect banks' margins,"" said ING, adding it regards rate hikes as ""data-driven, especially data on loan growth.""   ""We forecast another 27-basis-point hike in lending and deposit rates in 4Q 2007 and one 50 basis-point hike in the reserve requirement every quarter for the next couple of years."" 

  The central bank increased banks' reserves requirements twice so far this year, hiking the ratio by 50 basis points each time. 

  The stock market initially took a hit opening sharply lower. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index opened down 2.3% at 2864.26 and the Shenzhen Composite Index opened down 2.8% at 753.08. But within the hour the indexes turned around, rising steadily with large capitalization banks leading the path. The Shanghai index was up 2.5% at 3003.98 by midday and the Shenzhen index was up 1.1% at 782.88. 

  The U.S. dollar fell to CNY7.7350 midday on the over-the-counter market versus CNY7.7360 on Friday after the yuan was set at its strongest-ever level versus the dollar, CNY7.7351, in the central bank's central parity. China's bond prices also edged lower, and could continue to fall in coming weeks. The government bond index on the Shanghai exchange was at 111.71 at midday, down from Friday's close of  111.83, but also up from a morning low of 111.50. 

  Saturday's well-flagged rate increase announcement came after a string of strong data in recent weeks, with the most recent showing capital investment continued to increase strongly. China's urban fixed-asset investment in January and February rose 23.4% from the same period last year, faster than the average 21.8% forecast of seven economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and is an acceleration from December's FAI growth rate of 13.8%. 

  Although inflation remains within the central bank's under-3% target, PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan reportedly said Monday that he's more concerned about the trend. 

  China's consumer price index rose 2.7% in February from a year earlier, picking up from the 2.2% rise in January. In the first two months of the year, CPI rose 2.4% from the same period last year. 

  Economists expect rate hikes and a faster pace of yuan appreciation this year to overshadow stricter investment approval and control measures that have dominated the past tightening cycle. 

  The primary reason: China's huge and widening trade surplus. The gap between exports and imports rose 74% to $177.5 billion last year. The most recent data shows that hasn't eased as February's surplus hit US$23.76 billion widely outdoing the expected $8.3 billion surplus. 

  ""It should have become clear by now for Chinese policy makers that each time domestic investment got hit hard by policy tightening, China's trade surplus would surge,"" said Goldman Sachs in a note. 

  That could mean that China's other major economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, may play a smaller role in this round of tightening as Beijing fears tightening investment will depress the imports it wants to increase to close the trade gap. 

  The shift would also allow policy makers to test the ability of China's deepening financial markets' ability to respond to market-based controls. 

  China's economic planning agency may have also played a larger role last year as it was the start of a five-year planning period, where local governments set investment targets and start new major outlays.

  By I Made Sentana 

  OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  JAKARTA (Dow Jones)--Indonesia's inflation rate likely decelerated this month as the government managed to tame basic food prices, while stronger global commodity prices probably supported a trade surplus last month, analysts said. 

  Market-watchers will scrutinize the inflation and trade data more closely than usual as the central bank is seen as being at a crossroads on its rate policy. The Central Statistics Bureau is due to issue both sets of data around 0630 GMT Monday. 

  The average forecast of a Dow Jones Newswires survey of regional economists is for the Consumer Price Index to have risen 0.23% on month in March and 6.46% on year. Those projections compare with a rise of 0.62% on month and 6.30% on year in February. 

  The expected higher on-year inflation rate is due to a low base. 

  ""We expect to see a moderate level of inflation in March...as the prices of rice and sugar have been stable with a slight decline (in) the last week of the month,"" said Anton Gunawan, an economist with Citigroup in Jakarta. 

  On the trade front, the country's performance likely continued to be robust on the back of high prices and strong demand for oil, gas and commodities exports, analysts said. 

  Still, the trade surplus is projected to have edged up only slightly to $3.13 billion from $3.11 billion in January, the survey showed. 

  Exports are expected to have increased 13.05% on year in February, while imports are forecast to have risen 15.34%. In January, Indonesia's exports were $8.35 billion and imports $5.24 billion. 

  Given the likely inflation and trade data, four economists called for a 25-basis point cut in Bank Indonesia's policy rate when the central bank meets next. If Bank Indonesia keeps the rate unchanged, it will mark the second such pause since monetary policy easing began in May last year. 

  Bank Indonesia's Board of Governors will decide on possible adjustments to the benchmark rate, now at 9.00%, on April 5.

257,"Barron&apos;s(4/9) Other Voices: Golden Rules For Growing Economies

   (From BARRON'S) 
   By Jack White and Doug Ramsey 

  How can we explain the economic miracles of the last 40 years? Why have some nations prospered and others not? 

  India was positioned for the new world of outsourcing because so many Indians inherited the language of Shakespeare from the British Raj. 

  Japan's vertical, soup-to-nuts zaibatsu, or conglomerates, were well equipped to compete in export markets. 

  South Korea's early years of benevolent but undemocratic rule allowed the country to invest heavily inhigh-tech industries that would have foundered in a less-ordered economy. 

  Ireland turned its relative poverty into a prime asset, since it could be the European Community's low-wage magnet for international manufacturers. 

  These widely accepted explanations of economic success are mostly accidents of geography or history. 

  If speaking English were a guarantee of economic success, many former British colonies -- such as Malawi and Tanzania -- would not currently rank among the poorest nations in the world. 

  Greece succeeded Ireland as the poor man of today's European Union, but a flood of investment never materialized there. 

  If government intervention could ensure economic success, most Third World nations would no longer need to be international beggars to stay afloat. 

  And if democracy were the acid test of financial bounty, communist China would not be today's greatest economic turnaround story. 

  Economic miracles depend on three old-fashioned rules that also apply to career and business success. 

 

  -- Do it differently and do it better. 

 

  Whether companies are looking to gain market share or nations are aiming to boost gross domestic product, they need strategies that are both different and better. 

  Take South Korea. Through the 1980s, the country successfully modeled its economy on that of another resource-poor neighbor, Japan. With its cheaper labor, Korea slowly took heavy industries away from Japan-shipbuilding and steel, for example. 

  But Korea's greatest success dates back to the early 1990s, when the country finally stopped mimicking Japan and decided that it had the wherewithal to leap ahead of its neighbor and, indeed, most of the world. 

  With a combination of moral persuasion as well as judicious doses of government investment, Korea Inc. made a bold bid to become one of the world's first knowledge economies. 

  Understanding the importance of connectivity in an R&D-based economy, Korea resolved to make high-speed Internet access available to all Koreans, becoming the world leader in broadband penetration within five years. The country is doing the same with wireless broadband. 

  In retrospect, an important milestone was Korea's decision to adopt a little-known digital wireless technology called code-division multiple access, developed by a then-small San Diego company called Qualcomm. CDMA is a spread-spectrum technology that uses digital coding to allow many more wireless-phone calls to share the same bandwidth -- greatly increasing capacity and reducing costs. 

  By focusing on a new wireless standard rather than the entrenched system used primarily in Europe, Korean manufacturers could address their own market, and obtain a pole position in the U.S. cellular market. If you use a Samsung or LG phone today, it is because of a decision to do it differently and do it better made in Korea nearly 20 years ago. 

 

  -- Accept change, don't reject it. 

 

  Volumes have been written about how to master change, and about companies that have failed to do so. To its peril, Lucent was slow to make the transition from analog to digital technology. Many U.S. manufacturers failed to wake up to the fact of globalization until it was too late. 

  The Internet and broadband wireless are revolutionizing the information infrastructure and the way products are distributed and sold, and any company that fails to adapt to the new realities is likely to be left behind. 

  So what happens when it is an entire country that must accept change? 

  Recognizing that its economy was stymied by the failures of socialism, China opted for a different path. It instigated a parallel, free-market economy that would gradually become untethered from the political apparatus of the communist state. 

  The reforms began in 1979, a full decade before the fall of the Soviet Union. The ensuing boom proved that a 5,000-year-old country could turn on a dime if its mandarins largely stayed out of the market's way. 

  Within the global economy, China used its economies of scale to capture entire industries where its cheap labor gave it an advantage, while rotating its earnings into high-end technology industries that could compete head-on with the best in the West. 

  Of course, acceptance of change is, of itself, no guarantee of success. Unlike China, Russia embraced wholesale political as well as economic change almost overnight, but the ensuing free-for-all made a mockery of both democracy and free markets. A few ""oligarchs"" prospered, but the Russian economy took a decade to recover from the shock to its system. 

  Today's seeming health of the Russian economy stems from one of those accidents of geography: plentiful oil reserves. But as oil prices decline, so will Russia's economy. So it's not just accepting change, but how nations embrace change that makes the difference. 

 

  -- Educate your citizens. 

 

  Like the old adage about the importance of location in retailing, education is of paramount importance to every economy. Japan, Korea, Singapore -- indeed all the so-called 'tiger' economies of Asia --  stressed the importance of literacy and invested heavily in education long before their economies took off. 

  The rapid ascent of India and China in recent years, in large measure, is due to their ability to bring masses of literate, numerate workers into high-tech industries that depend increasingly on research and development for growth. 

  China and the U.S. awarded roughly the same number of undergraduate engineering degrees in 1986; since then, U.S. degrees have steeply declined, to 60,000 a year -- and many of these are awarded to foreign-born students -- while China is producing more than 250,000 a year. As part of its plan to become a developed nation by 2015, India has plans to educate more than 4 million engineers annually. 

  Increasingly, the call-center jobs for U.S. consumer-products companies outsourced to Bangalore are making opportunities for research and development jobs. 

  High-tech multinationals recognize that innovation can happen anywhere, as long as the workforce is highly trained and has good incentives. This comes as no surprise to the Indians, or Chinese, or Japanese, who watched the great clusters of innovation in the United States grow up in Silicon Valley, San Diego, Chicago, Boston, Research Triangle, Seattle and other places, always with good access to major universities. 

  Even in labor-intensive sectors where R&D is not as big a factor, skilled workers can play a critical role in devising new quality-of-service methods and improvements in manufacturing. A culture of education permeates societies where economic miracles have occurred. 

  Economic miracles do happen, but there is nothing miraculous about them. Countries from China to Chile, India to Ireland, went back to basics and followed a few golden rules to succeed. They now welcome change and count on knowledge workers and innovation to keep their economies growing. 

  The United States can and must do the same.

258,"WSJ(4/28) Abreast Of The Market: Microsoft, GE, 3M Rise Fri

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Karen Talley 

  As the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its record run to a third straight session Friday, the might was provided by Microsoft, General Electric and 3M. 

  The Dow industrials rose 15.44 points to 13120.94, passing Thursday's record of 13105.5. The Dow got as high as 13148 during the session, exceeding the record intraday peak of 13132.8 it put in the day before. 

  The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.75 to 2557.21. While the Dow is delivering all-time highs, the Nasdaq Composite remains well off its record peak of 5048.62, hit seven years ago. 

  The Nasdaq did, however, slip past the 50%-there mark Tuesday, by closing at 2524.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index shed 1.18 to 1494.07. 

  For the week, both the Dow and Nasdaq gained 1.2%; the S&P 500 gained 0.7%. 

  Microsoft (Nasdaq) rose $1.02, or 3.5%, to $30.12, the Dow's best percentage gainer. The software titan posted a 65% jump in fiscal third-quarter earnings and issued an upbeat forecast for the next year, reaping dividends from the broad rollout of its long-delayed Windows Vista operating system. For the week, Microsoft advanced 3.8%. 

  GE gained 1, or 2.8%, to 36.84. Citigroup called on the conglomerate to spin off three units, saying the company's size and complexity are working against investor interest in the stock and has eroded value. 

  3M rose 1.10, or 1.4%, to 81.55, adding to Thursday's 4.5% advance when the maker of Post-It Notes and Scotch tape reported a 52% surge in first-quarter earnings. For the week, 3M advanced 4.9%. 

  International Business Machines added 27 cents to 101.17, remaining above the 100 level it topped earlier in the week after boosting its stock-buyback plan by as much as $15 billion and approving a 33% quarterly dividend increase. For the week, IBM rose 7%. 

  Cummins leapt 10.15, or 12%, to 96.14. The industrial manufacturer posted a 6% increase in first-quarter earnings and increased full-year guidance well beyond Wall Street's expectations. Friday's advance was the latest in a run that has raised the stock 63% this year. 

  UAL (Nasdaq) fell 2.91, or 8%, to 34.04; American Airlines parent AMR lost 1.34, or 4.8%, to 26.35; and Continental Airlines dropped 2.53, or 6.5%, to 36.25. Air carriers struggled as the price of oil surged by 2.2% a barrel and J.P. Morgan Securities cut ratings for six airline stocks. 

  Omnicare lost 6.42, or 16%, to 34.90, the NYSE's biggest percentage decliner. The nursing-home pharmacy company reported a 19% drop in first-quarter profit, hurt by lower prices on generic drugs, and cut its forecast for 2007 earnings. 

  Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates jumped 13, or 23%, to 70, the second best Nasdaq percentage gainer. Fiscal second-quarter net income more than doubled to $38.4 million, or 69 cents a share, and the chip-equipment producer said revenue increased 42% to $241.8 million. 

  Baidu.com's American depositary receipts rose 15.20, or 14%, to 124.57 on the Nasdaq. China's Internet-search leader posted first-quarter net earnings of $11.1 million, or 32 cents a share, vastly up from a year earlier. 

  Burger King gained 73 cents, or 3.2%, to 23.45, benefiting from restaurant expansion and a lower tax rate, reversed a year-earlier loss and posted better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings.

259,"INTERVIEW: Ex-MOF Sakakibara: G7 Unlikely To Focus On Yen

 
   By Takashi Nakamichi 
   OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--The yen is ""abnormally"" weak against other major currencies, but Group of Seven finance chiefs aren't likely to focus on the yen when they meet in Washington later this month, a former top Japanese currency official said Tuesday. 

  That is because the yen's weakness is due to Japan's monetary policy settings and G7 officials don't usually discuss a country's domestic policy, he said. 

  ""The cause of the yen's weakness is clear - that is, Japan's low interest rates,"" Eisuke Sakakibara told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. ""It isn't a matter of foreign exchange. It is an issue of monetary policy. Meddling in each other's monetary policy is usually avoided (by G7 officials). In that sense, (the yen) probably won't become an openly debated topic."" 

  Sakakibara served as vice finance minister for international affairs between 1997-1999 and was known as Mr Yen for his ability to move the exchange rate of the currency with his comments. He currently is director of Waseda University's Indian economic studies institute. 

  His comments are in line with currency traders' expectations that the Japanese currency will take a back seat to other issues at the coming G7 talks because the dollar and the euro have slowed their pace of appreciation versus the yen after a global stock market selloff and temporary yen surges in late February and early March. 

  Still, G7 officials don't all agree with Sakakibara. 

  Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi said earlier Tuesday that he doubts G7 officials will discuss the yen, but his Canadian counterpart, Jim Flaherty, said Monday that he ""wouldn't be surprised if (the yen's exchange rate) was the subject of some discussion."" 

  Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the U.S., Japan, Germany, England, France, Italy and Canada will meet in Washington, D.C. on April 13. 

  G7 May Warn Vs Yen-Carry Trades Again 

  Sakakibara said that while G7 representatives may skirt around the yen's value, they will likely repeat their warning made in February about yen-carry trades, a risky investment strategy that many analysts blame for the yen's persistent weakness. 

  ""The markets are continuing carry trades,"" he said. ""There's no question that the yen is abnormally weak."" 

  For example, the euro's ""fair value"" against the yen is Y110.00 to Y115.00 based on Japan's trade competitiveness and other factors, said Sakakibara. That is well below the common European currency's current level of Y158.34. 

  As for the dollar-yen exchange rate, he said that given Japan's international competitiveness, the country's manufacturers ""can easily live with rates of around Y100.00 to Y110.00."" 

  ""For the time being"", however, the greenback will hug a range of Y115.00 to Y120.00, underpinned by Japanese investors' appetite for overseas assets that pay higher returns than those at home, he said. 

  At 1000 GMT Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at Y118.60. 

 
   Bank of Japan May Raise Interest Rates Next Month 
 

  Turning to Japan's monetary policy, Sakakibara said the Bank of Japan may increase interest rates in May because the country's economy is in its ""best condition"", growing at a price-adjusted annual pace of around 2.5% while prices are stable. 

  ""I think a May rate hike is possible,"" he said. 

  ""To be sure, things would evolve differently if the (Japanese) economy slipped into a downtrend or stock prices make a nosedive,"" he said. ""But as long as the current economic conditions are maintained, a May hike would be nothing strange."" 

  Sakakibara's prediction is at odds with consensus that the central bank will stand pat until after parliamentary elections in July. 

  ""The markets have been wrong recently,"" forecasting a rate hike in January, when the bank stayed put, while anticipating no tightening in February, when the bank lifted rates by a quarter percentage point to 0.50%, he said. ""It may be wise not to put your faith on the markets."" 

  Sakakibara himself urged the BOJ to ""normalize"" Japan's ""unusually low interest rates"" and stop fueling yen-carry trades by pumping money into the world's money markets. 

  ""There're various opinions (on what levels constitute normal policy rates in Japan), but ... they may be around 2.0%,"" he said. The U.S. policy rate is 5.25%, while the rate in Europe is 3.75%, ""but growth rates of the U.S. economy and the European economy are almost the same as Japan's."" 

  He played down Japan's lack of inflation, which he attributed to slow wage growth and fierce business competition in Japan - developments that are ""positive things"" for the economy. 

  ""It doesn't make sense for Japanese real interest rates to stay near zero.""

261,"3rd UPDATE: Kimberly Clark 1Q Net Up 64% On Higher Sales

 

  (Adds comments from a conference call and other details.) 

 
   By Anjali Cordeiro 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) reported a 64% increase in its first-quarter profit, propelled by growth in its North American personal care business, strength in emerging markets and higher prices for some of its products. 

  The company, which sells brands like Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, continues to face inflationary pressures due to an escalation in fiber costs. Kimberly Clark's first-quarter earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, but the company left its forecast for the year unchanged due to commodity cost pressures. The lower end of the company's guidance range for the year is below Wall Street's average estimate. The stock was recently down $1.04, or 1.4%, to $70.90. 

  Like most other consumer-product companies Kimberly-Clark has been grappling with higher commodity prices and has been forced to prune costs in order to keep increasing profits. In July 2005, the company announced a cost reduction plan that would streamline its manufacturing and administrative operations. The company said it continues to execute this plan and is in a good position to meet or exceed its target to save $75 million to $100 million for the first year. 

  The Irving, Texas, maker of personal-care and health-care products earned $452 million, or 98 cents a share, compared with $275.1 million, or 60 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

  Excluding items related to the company's ongoing restructuring, earnings rose to $1.03 a share from 93 cents a share a year earlier. 

  Sales for the first quarter totaled $4.39 billion, up from $4.07 billion a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial, on average, expected the company to earn $1.01 a share in the latest period on revenue of $4.27 billion. 

  ""Overall I think they are making small steps in the right direction,"" said A.G. Edwards analyst Jason Gere. The company's personal-care business is doing extremely well, he said. 

  Still, Gere said he found Kimberly-Clark's guidance for the full year somewhat conservative. ""I don't blame them - fiber costs are still going up,"" said Gere. 

  JPMorgan analyst John Faucher wrote that sales volumes  in the company's consumer tissue segment - which were down 2% - came in below his expectations. 

  In developing and emerging markets, sales increased 16%. Kimberly-Clark said sales growth was particularly strong in Latin America, China and Russia. 

  Sales of personal-care products, which also include Kotex feminine care items, increased 11% in the quarter to $1.8 billion. Sales of Huggies diapers, baby wipes and Pull-Ups training pants were strong. 

  Sales of consumer tissue products, such as Kleenex and Scott bathroom tissue, grew 6.4% to $1.59 billion. 

  Kimberly-Clark had recently said it expects first-quarter adjusted earnings to be at or slightly above the high end of its previous guidance of 99 cents to $1.01 a share. 

  Kimberly-Clark expects adjusted earnings for the second quarter of $1.01 to $1.03 a share. For 2007, the company projects adjusted earnings of $4.10 to $4.20 a share. On average, Wall Street is expecting second-quarter earnings of $1.02 a share and full-year earnings of $4.20 a share. 

  ""We also remain focused on cutting costs although the industry experts are predicting that fiber costs will come down later this year,"" Chief Executive Thomas Falk said in a conference call. ""We'll continue to monitor input costs and the competitive environment carefully to see if any other actions are required."" 

  Kimberly-Clark was a client of A.G. Edwards and JP Morgan in the past 12 months.

262,"Romania Ctrl Bk Cuts 2007 CPI Forecast To 3.7%-Mediafax -2-

 

  The bank is sticking to its previous forecast of an acceleration in annual inflation to 4.2% in 2008, he told a news conference. Inflation was 4.87% in 2006. 

  Romanian inflation slowed to 3.66% on the year in March from 3.87% in February, the lowest annual rate since records began in 1990 after the fall of the Communist regime. 

  The latest data showed the country's consumer price index rose 0.31% in the quarter, down considerably from the 1.48% increase in the first three months of 2006. 

  ""In the first quarter of the year, the disinflation process continued at a higher pace than our expectations,"" Isarescu said. 

  The slowdown in inflation was driven by an appreciation of the Romanian currency, a drop in price of fuel and some other items, such as eggs and fruit, and the elimination of customs taxes with European Union countries, he said. 

  The central bank has set an inflation target of 3% to 5% percent in 2007 and 2.8% to 4.8% in 2008.

263,"WSJ(5/16) Milk Prices Pressure Food Firms

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Anjali Cordeiro 

  An ethanol-fueled rally and strong global demand for corn have pushed milk prices higher, creating another pressure on already hamstrung food companies. 

  Companies that churn out chocolates, yogurt, ice cream and cheese have begun to feel the heat, prompting them to warn Wall Street of lower earnings and ponder price increases. 

  Hershey Co. last week tempered its guidance for the year because of higher costs for milk. Dean Foods Co., which makes ice cream, Horizon organic milk and yogurt, earlier this month warned it would only meet the lower end of a previous forecast. 

  Dean Foods' stock price is off 25% so far this year, while Hershey's stock is up 5%. 

  ""We are increasingly concerned about rapidly rising raw-milk prices and industry estimates for continued increases through the balance of the year,"" Dean Foods Chief Executive Gregg Engles told analysts and investors in a conference call in early May. 

  A confluence of factors are propelling dairy prices higher. Prices for corn, which is used in the production of ethanol, have been rising because of a surge in demand for biofuel. The higher prices for corn, coupled with higher costs for soybeans and hay, have been making livestock feed more expensive. 

  There also are other forces in play. According to Chris Galen, spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, a number of food companies have been looking to buy milk produced without the use of the artificial bovine growth hormones known as RVST. While use of those hormones can help increase productivity, a drop in usage crimps supply, he said. 

  At the same time, demand for dairy products has been strong internationally because of a weaker dollar, strong demand from fast-growing Asian economies and a slowdown in the dairy industries of Australia and New Zealand, Mr. Galen said. 

  ""Demand is going to be very strong globally and that is going to push market prices higher this year,"" said Kenneth Bailey, associate professor for agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University. 

  Class III milk futures, which represent milk used in cheddar cheese, have risen roughly 32% on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange so far this year. Class IV milk futures, which represent milk used to make butter and nonfat dry milk, are up about 26%. 

  Food companies have been grappling with a variety of inflationary pressures. Energy prices are off last year's peak, but oil remains above $60 a barrel. Most food companies have to raise prices for their products in order to fight the cost pressures. Prices for grains like wheat have increased in tandem with corn. 

  Kraft Foods Inc. said it increased prices earlier this year on some of its dairy-based products because of rising commodity costs. The company -- whose stable of brands includes Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft singles -- said it continues to monitor the market, and will adjust its prices accordingly. 

  Raising prices can be a difficult decision for food companies like Kraft, which are facing competition from cheaper private-label, or store, brands, said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. Still, he added that the rise in a commodity such as milk tends to be felt by private-label producers too. 

  ""If everyone is feeling pinched, it's easier to get pricing,"" Mr. Warren said. ""In this case it is probably likely everyone will be able to take some incremental pricing."" 

  Food companies sometimes try hedging techniques to protect themselves against higher commodity prices. But commodity prices can be volatile and the hedging process complicated. 

  ""We did a very small hedging operation with regard to dairy about 18 months ago, but we couldn't get sufficient interest from a counterparty [for it] to be significant for us,"" said Starbucks Corp. Chief Financial Officer Michael Casey on a conference call this month. The coffee chain has felt the impact of higher dairy costs, and has said its outlook for the year takes those pressures into consideration.

264,"Zimbabwe Pres Tells African Trade Bloc Seek Econ Independence

  NAIROBI (AP)--Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, whose country is in a financial tailspin, told Africa's largest trading bloc Wednesday that the continent will achieve true economic independence by producing finished goods for sale to the rest of the world. 

  Mugabe spoke during the final day of a summit by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, which is trying to make it cheaper and easier to do business on an impoverished continent that is struggling to lure foreign investment. 

  ""Because we are producers of primary products, the commodities we produce are not priced by us,"" Mugabe told leaders of the 20-nation bloc, known as COMESA. ""They go to markets where they are priced for us."" 

  Zimbabwe is struggling through its worst economic crisis since independence in 1980, with an inflation rate in the thousands. The problems have been blamed on corruption, mismanagement and the often-violent seizures of thousands of white-owned commercial farms ordered by Mugabe beginning in 2000 that disrupted the agriculture-based economy. 

  On Tuesday, COMESA endorsed a standard customs tax as part of a deal designed to make doing business in Africa more attractive to investors. The agreement is set to go into effect in 2008. 

  The deal calls for charging 10% tax on semi-processed products and 25% on finished goods being imported into most of COMESA's member countries - lower than the taxes in place in many African nations. But not all COMESA's 20 members were prepared to join quickly, despite endorsing the deal, and some may never take part. 

  Still, COMESA's outgoing chairman, President Ismael Omar Guelleh of Djibouti, said the union would lead to more foreign investment and ""deeper integration into the world economy."" 

  Established 12 years ago, COMESA represents about 390 million people and has an estimated gross domestic product of $200 billion. The value of trade within COMESA countries rose to $6.3 billion in 2005, from $4.5 billion in 2004, according to the Kenyan Trade and Industry Ministry. 

  COMESA has been a free trade area since 2000 but only 13 of its 20 members have signed on to the free trade area agreement. Other trade blocs, such as the five-nation East African Community, have had to negotiate exemptions to their customs unions to avoid hurting individual nations. 

  COMESA's member countries are Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sudan, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 

  Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki took over as chairman from Guelleh on Tuesday.

265,"UPDATE: Colombia Central Bank Ups Key Rate 25 BPs To 8.75%

 

  (Updates with comments from Central Bank govenrnor, finance minister) 

 

  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--Colombia's Central Bank on Friday raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.75%, from 8.5%, in an expected move that was designed to reduce inflationary pressures. 

  ""This decision was taken after taking into account April's inflation, which came in higher than expected,"" the monetary policy committee said in a statement after its monthly meeting. ""Moreover demand and credit keep showing strong growth."" 

  Ten out of 12 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires before the decision had said they expected a 25-basis-point increase. 

  Strong demand for consumer goods accentuated by robust economic growth has put strong upward pressure on inflation. Twelve-month rolling inflation reached 6.26% at the end of April, well above the central bank's target for 2007 of between 3.5% and 4.5%. The bank reiterated at Friday's meeting that it is maintaining the same target. 

  ""Inflation is clearly outside the target and inflation expectations are deteriorating fast,"" Goldman Sachs said in a research report before the decision. 

  JPMorgan said it expects another rate hike in June and wouldn't rule out further hikes if inflation and inflationary expectations don't show signs of easing by the end of June. 

  Barclays Capital sees a similar hike at the bank's June meeting, ""after which we expect the central bank to pause,"" it said. ""The April spike in inflation to 6.26% makes a total of 50 basis points in hikes in the short term very likely,"" Barclays said. ""Nonetheless, the worst of the inflation surprises is likely behind us."" 

  All three banks had forecasted a 25-basis-point increase. 

  Speaking after the decision, central bank governor Jose Dario Uribe said the 275 basis points of rate hikes since April 2006 will soon start to quell price pressures. 

  Uribe urged the central government to reduce spending, which would also help curb inflation. ""I reiterate that an austere fiscal policy will improve the efficiency of the Colombian economy,"" Uribe said. 

  Finance Minister Oscar Ivan Zuluaga said the government expects to end the year with total debt of 147 trillion Colombian pesos ($74.2 billion), unchanged from last year. ""Our spending is not increasing,"" Zuluaga said. 

  The central bank, meanwhile, said it believes measures it introduced May 6 will begin to take effect and contribute to promoting its monetary policy. The bank imposed higher reserve requirements on bank deposits and required 40% of the proceeds from foreign loans to be deposited with the Central Bank for six months without interest. The bank also limited the amounts banks and brokerages can invest in derivatives and hedging operations. 

  ""Next week, we will evaluate how the measures have slowed down the flow of capital inflows,"" Zuluaga added. 

  But the bank didn't take any steps to try to influence the currency at Friday's meeting. Rising interest rates, coupled with strong export revenue and heavy foreign direct investment, have driven the peso higher against the U.S. dollar, and some analysts had expected action to offset Friday's interest rate hike. 

  Zuluaga, who sits on the Central Bank board, stressed the sharp appreciation comes from foreign direct investment and not from short-term portfolio investments. 

  Late Friday, the Colombian peso was stronger against the U.S. dollar in New York trading, at COP1,979 per U.S. dollar, from COP1,985 earlier. The currency has gained around 13% against the dollar so far this year. 

  The sharp appreciation of the peso has already left 15,000 people without jobs in the textile industry and a 6,000 jobs in the flower industry, according to Zuluaga. 

  Zuluaga said the government will announce a subsidy package to help exporters early next week.

266,"US Stocks Rise On Tame Inflation Data; GM, McDonald&apos;s Gain

 
   By Joanna Ossinger 
   Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE 
 

  Stocks surged Tuesday amid tame inflation data that bolstered Wall Street's hopes for an interest-rate cut in the near future. 

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 122 to 13469. The S&P 500 added 9 to 1512, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 8 to 2554. 

  Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by more than two to one. 

  ""I read [the CPI data] as very bullish for the economy,"" said Timothy Rogers, chief economist at Briefing.com. ""I suspect that the reasons for the Fed to tighten [interest rates] have largely disappeared."" 

  Early Tuesday, the Labor Department said the April consumer price index rose 0.4%, but the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced just 0.2%. The data, which largely matched Wall Street forecasts for a 0.5% CPI increase and 0.2% core rise, suggest inflation remains tame. That reinforced a growing belief among investors that Federal Reserve policy makers will cut rates later this year; Rogers expects a quarter-point drop in the fourth quarter. 

  Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and spur investment, so hopes for lower rates tend to boost stocks. However, they can also fuel inflation, which until recently was outside of the Fed's comfort zone. Now that price growth seems to have slowed, the Fed may feel freer to soften its vigilant stance on inflation, and perhaps even cut rates. 

  The Dow went on a tear after the CPI data came out, bolstered by a gain of 3.7% from General Motors and a 2.2% rise from McDonald's, among others. Amid strong global growth, Wall Street is starting to see large-cap companies as more attractive than small caps, a trend magnified in recent days by a mature bull run that has investors buying into the safety of blue chips. Tuesday midday, 25 of 30 Dow components were trading higher. 

  Wal-Mart reported an 8.1% increase in first-quarter net income amid gains abroad and at its Sam's Club chain, even as its namesake stores saw lower same-store sales, or sales in stores open a year or more. The world's largest retailer said second-quarter earnings may miss analysts' expectations. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.2%. 

  Home Depot's profit fell 30% in the first quarter, as the No. 1 U.S. home-improvement retailer continued to struggle amid a weak housing demand. Revenue fell 0.6% to $21.59 billion from $21.46 billion a year earlier and same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, dropped 7.6%. Home Depot shares fell 0.3%. 

  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke about credit derivatives Tuesday at the Atlanta Fed's financial markets conference. He didn't address the economy or monetary policy. 

  DaimlerChrysler said its net income more than doubled, as the Mercedes group swung to a profit, even as its U.S. unit saw its losses widen on a restructuring plan. The stock added 2.6%. 

  Thomson and Reuters Group agreed on terms for a merger valued at more than $17 billion in cash and stock, cinching a deal that the two news and data providers outlined earlier this month. Reuters's shares rose 4.2%. 

  Amgen shares fell 5.1% after the government's Medicare program proposed limiting payments for the use of anti-anemia drugs based on safety concerns. 

  Agilent Technologies rose 4.5% after its current quarter earnings per share and revenue outlook topped analyst estimates. 

  Crude-oil futures rose 52 cents to $62.98 a barrel. 

 
   In major market action: 
 

  Stocks rose. On the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday,2,180 stocks gained and 922 declined, on volume of 637 million shares traded on the exchange. 

  Bonds fell. The 10-year Treasury note was down 1/32, or 31.25 cents for every $1,000 invested, yielding 4.704% Tuesday. The 30-year bond fell 1/32, yielding 4.871%. 

  The dollar weakened. The euro traded at $1.3605 from $1.3544 late Monday, while the dollar was at 120.19 yen from 120.35 yen.

  SAINT PETERSBURG (Dow Jones)-Russia's gross domestic product should grow 6.5% to 6.7% in 2007, Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin told journalists Saturday. 

  This is about 0.5% higher than the government's initial forecasts, Kudrin said at an economic forum. 

  He also said the the country will meet also meet the targeted rate of a rise of no more than 8% in consumer prices. 

  He said, however, that the massive net capital inflows are causing a headache for the Central Bank's and government's monetary policy. 

  ""We have to maneuver among several options here and limit the overall monetary mass on the market,"" Kudrin said. One of the options, already exercised by the bank was the increase in minimum reserve requirements in the banking system, starting July 1. 

  "" If these instruments appear insufficient then the Central Bank has to increase the exchange rate,"" Kudrin said. 

  He predicted that by the year's end, capital inflows, which have become a cardinal factor in monetary conditions since the abolition of capital controls 12 months ago, will exceed $70 billion this year. Earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Naryshkin put the figure as high as $90 billion. 

  Kudrin said the second half of the year should see much lower net capital inflows, but he also warned that ""it depends on agreements in the private sector."" 

  Separately, Kudrin reiterated that there are no plans of investing the Stabilization Fund money on the stock exchange market. 

  ""This would create a bubble on the market that would keep growing without proportion,"" Kudrin said.

271,"ADR REPORT: BHP Up After Possible Alcoa Bid; Ericsson Climbs

 
   By Carla Mozee 
 

  U.S.-listed shares of foreign companies edged higher Monday, with BHP Billiton (BHP) shares lending support following a report that the mining giant is preparing a $40 billion bid for Alcoa Corp. (AA). 

  A jump in shares of Ericsson LM (ERICY) and China Medical Technologies Inc. (CMED) also aided gains in the market for American depositary receipts. 

  The Bank of New York Composite ADR Index rose 0.2%, resisting broader market weakness in part as Wall Street tracked a jump in crude-oil prices past $68 a barrel. 

  Crude futures reached their highest level in more than two months as violence and the threat of a labor strike in Nigeria heated up concerns about oil-production decreases. 

  Energy shares were higher. China National Offshore Oil (CEO) climbed 2.8% to $112.57; PetroChina (PTR) rose 1.9% to $142.31; and Total (TOT) picked up 0.6% to $79.21. 

  Also in the resources sector, shares of BHP Billiton rose 1.4% to $58.67 after a Times of London report that the Anglo-Australian miner is considering a bid for aluminum producer Alcoa. 

  BHP, which set aside the takeover plans in February, has begun to review the merits of a potential deal, said the Times. Alcoa is in the midst of a bidding war for its Canadian rival, Alcan (AL). 

  Stock in Rio Tinto (RTP) and Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) traded mixed, Rio Tinto off 0.3% to $307.43 and CVRD up 1.4% to $47.62. 

  Other mining stocks moved higher as gold prices hit their strongest level in more than a week and copper futures bounced up 2.4% and touched their highest prices in a month. 

  Harmony Gold (HMY) gained 3.2% while Gold Fields (GFI) and Buenaventura (BVN) of Peru rose 0.2% and 1.4%, respectively. 

 
   Ericsson, China Medical Surge 
 

  Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent (ALU) were in the plus column after the companies were chosen by AT&T (T) on Friday to provide equipment for upgrades to the telecom services provider's broadband network. 

  ""The selection has been expected ... yet is still a modest positive for Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson,"" said analysts at Morgan Keegan & Co. in a note to clients. 

  Ericsson shares jumped 4.8% to $39.51 in heavy trading. Alcatel-Lucent rose 1.5% to $13.66. 

  Nokia (NOK), which competes with Ericsson on the handset market, shed 1.1% to $28.69. The company backed its view that it expects its global market share to rise in the second quarter, though company officials declined to offer a specific figure. 

  The session's strongest percentage gainer was China Medical Technologies (CMED), soaring 13.1 to $30.81 in heavy trading. The company said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 21% to about $10.8 million, or 40 cents a share. 

  Revenue leaped 46% to $21.4 million. China Med also forecast a jump of 51.7% to $59.1% in sales for 2007. 

  Strength in China Med shares contributed to a 2.1% rise in the China ADR Index.

272,"Turkey Finance Minister Unhappy With Strength Of New Lira-IHA

 

  ESKISEHIR, Turkey (Dow Jones)--Turkish Finance Minister Kemal Unakitan said he isn't happy with the strength of the new Turkish lira, but added that the central bank is independent and controls monetary policy, the Ihlas news agency, or IHA, reported Monday. 

  ""Actually, it doesn't make me happy to see the Turkish lira firming so much,"" Unakitan said during a meeting with businessmen Saturday. ""The independence of the central bank makes it impossible for us to interfere."" 

  ""The new lira being this strong puts exporters in a difficult position while imports of intermediate goods increase, which leads the current account deficit to rise,"" he said. ""In my opinion, it is not correct that the Turkish lira is so strong, but it's the central bank that directs monetary policy."" 

  Exporters have criticized the ruling AK Party government in recent years for allowing the new lira to appreciate. Turkey is due to hold general elections July 22. 

  A spike in inflation last year triggered a 29% slide in the new lira against the dollar and led the central bank to raise interest rates by 425 basis points. The new lira is currently trading at TRY1.2880 to the dollar, about 4.5% stronger than it was in May 2006 before it slumped. 

  Unakitan said the government is supporting the central bank's fight against inflation by not raising liquidity in the market. 

  ""We support fiscal discipline,"" he said. ""We don't inject too much money into the markets. But after the elections, markets will see more liquidity.""

273,"Eurobonds: CDS Indexes Wider On US Subprime, Data Worries

 

  By Michael Wilson 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Spreads on the European credit-default swap iTraxx indexes widened early Tuesday due to more concern about the U.S. subprime mortgage market and upcoming data releases. 

  Spreads had tightened in recent days following high levels of volatility last week, but a deterioration in the ABX subprime derivatives index overnight signaled that worries over the U.S. subprime mortgage market are still present, pushing European credit spreads wider again. 

  ""There was no conviction to the recent rally, and it now seems to have stalled,"" said a Dresdner Kleinwort analyst, who recommended investors take a defensive position. 

  The BBB portion of the ABX.HE 07-1 subprime derivatives index, which tracks credit derivatives written on subprime mortgages, lost four points Monday, hitting an all-time low of 45 cents. 

  Concerns over risky mortgage debt were exacerbated by two reports released Monday by ratings agency Fitch Ratings, highlighting the excessive use of leverage by credit hedge funds and the expected rise of defaults in the commercial-mortgage sector. 

  Unicredit said U.S. producer price index data, due at 1230 GMT, could also prove negative for credit, as an above-consensus result may feed fears that the rate of headline inflation is rising. 

  Continued high levels of inflation could prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates, dashing the hopes of investors who believe that a fall in house prices will be halted by a cut in the cost of borrowing. 

  The iTraxx Crossover index of 50 weaker-rated credits widened during the morning session to 285/286 basis points from 277/280 basis points at the open. The index widened significantly overnight, opening more than 10 basis points wider from its 267.5 basis points close Monday. 

  The Europe Main index of 125 investment-grade names also widened to 29.5/29.75 basis points from its 28/29 opening level. The index hit its widest point of 30 basis points early Tuesday, amid ""good volumes of protection buying all morning,"" said a European credit strategist. 

  Single names moved slightly wider with the market Tuesday, but saw no real moves as worries about systemic risk grabbed the attention. 

  ""All investment-grade single names are marked one to two basis points weaker, but all the concentration is on the indexes this morning,"" said a trader. 

  The primary market seems to be in wait-and-see mode given the recent market volatility. A rise in the level of risk-aversion means that investors are now demanding a higher premium to hold risk, which is driving up the cost of funding. 

  Late Monday, Russian state-controlled oil producer OAO Rosneft postponed its two-tranche Eurobond issue according to the deal's lead managers. 

  Rosneft had been preparing to issue up to $5 billion of debt to refinance recent acquisitions, and bankers familiar with the matter had said it wanted to issue $2 billion-equivalent of Eurobonds in separate tranches and currencies, with maturities of five and 10 years. 

  Rosneft is looking to refinance part of the $22 billion of debt it took on to buy most of the assets of OAO Yukos at the company's liquidation earlier this year.

274,"Forex Focus: Euro Support May Grow As Oil Prices Rally

 

  By Nicholas Hastings 

  A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 

 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Expect the euro to keep on climbing against the dollar. 

  With oil prices rising, money supply growing and labor markets tightening, the European Central Bank's concern about inflation could step up a notch, even though current inflation levels in the euro zone remain subdued. 

  This is likely to contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve. While the rise in crude prices will hardly encourage the Fed to relinquish its hawkish stance, the damage higher gasoline prices poses to U.S. growth prospects could mean that the U.S. central bank starts leaning towards easing rates again. 

  This likely shift in investor support in the euro's favor emerged at the end of last week as the price of crude futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied over $70 a barrel for the first time in 10 months. 

  In itself, the rise may not be so remarkable, given other recent gyrations in the price of crude. But, this time round, analysts say that the rally is sustainable as it's being driven largely by a deterioration in U.S. refining  that will bring further tightness in the U.S. gasoline market.

275,"US MONEY WK AHEAD: Tsys May Gain More Support From Subprime

 

  (This article was originally published Friday) 

 
   By Laurence Norman 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The usual summer calm looks set to be postponed at least another week in the Treasury market, with the 10-year yield falling through the key 5% level Friday and investors remaining very sensitive to developments in the troubled subprime mortgage market. 

  While growth data next week should remind investors that the U.S. economy bounced back in the second quarter, that may not be enough to subdue flight-to-quality buying which has knocked 15 basis points off the 10-year yield since Monday, and sent prices soaring. 

  Friday brought the sharpest Treasury gains, following Standard & Poor's announcement that it lowered the ratings on 14 European synthetic collateralized debt obligations, or CDO, tranches. The announcement helped widen risk premiums in credit markets and added to declines in stock markets and the dollar. The move was also strong enough to force the 10-year yield decisively below 5% and to its lowest level since early June. 

  Friday afternoon, the 10-year Treasury was up 19/32 for a 4.95% yield, while the long bond was up 28/32 for 5.06%. The two-year note was up 4/32 for 4.78%. 

  ""The fundamentals are going to continue to take a backstage...unless there's some really good news"" in next Friday's gross domestic product data, said George Goncalves, chief Treasury, TIPS and agency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. ""Investors are in this risk reduction mode and so long as that's the case, I wouldn't want to stand in the way of the price action."" 

  The market's focus on the impact of subprime - home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories - was given sharper focus this week by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. While the Fed has consistently argued that the economic impact of the subprime market's struggles has so far been contained, Bernanke cited estimates to senators Thursday that suggested the subprime-related credit losses could amount to between $50 billion and $100 billion. Frequent speculation of subprime related losses at U.S. and overseas banks or hedge funds have kept investors jittery. 

  Goncalves said with the full picture unlikely to become clear for some time, the subprime story could continue to subdue Treasury yields - keeping them well below the Fed's 5.25% target funds rate. 

  ""I think we'll stay at these richer levels next week,"" he said, adding that the yield curve should steepen as shorter-term Treasurys see the biggest bid. 

 
    Growth, Housing Data Top The Bill 
 

  For Andrew Richman, managing director at SunTrust Personal Asset Management with around $8 billion in fixed income assets under management, ""there's certainly fear"" that the subprime story could spread to the prime market and have a sharper impact on fixed income assets. 

  Given the jitters, he said the 10-year yield could easily fall toward 4.85% in the days ahead. However, he believes the subprime story will ultimately be contained and thinks Treasurys are likely settling into a 4.85%-5.25% range. 

  ""Yields already don't look that attractive"" at Friday's sub-5% levels. ""We'd opportunistically take advantage"" to sell when the 10-year yield falls to 4.85% and buy when it tops 5.20%, he said. 

  If anything will pressure Treasury prices lower and yields higher next week, it's likely to be the GDP data. The economy is expected to have expanded 3.2% in the second quarter, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Annualized first quarter growth was 0.7%. 

  John Miller, head of funds management at Nuveen Asset Management, said the report should provide ""a vote of confidence in the diversity and broad-based resilience of the economy."" However, he acknowledged that with expectations for the number already high and some concerns that the economy's ""momentum could be waning a little bit in the second half of the year,"" investors' reaction to the data could be subdued. 

  The other major data next week are housing numbers, with June existing home sales seen falling to an annualized 5.90 million from 5.99 million in May when it's reported Wednesday. On Thursday, new home sales are expected at an annualized 900,000 from 915,000 in May. 

  Again however, Miller said that with the weak housing story well absorbed by markets, the data will largely ""reinforce concerns that are already out there."" 

  Next week also sees several Treasury Department auctions, with the government selling $6 billion in reopened 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities on Tuesday. There are also two- and five-year Treasurys auctions. 

  SunTrust's Richman said that with buyers currently active, the sales ""should go fairly well,"" although with the bigger subprime story dominating the headlines, ""I don't see tremendous upside or downside risk"" for the market from the auctions.

276,"Vietnam Preliminary July CPI +8.39% On Yr, +0.94% On Month

 

  HANOI (Dow Jones)--Vietnam's consumer price index is projected to have risen 8.39% in July from the same month last year, due mainly to higher food and housing costs, government data issued Tuesday showed. 

  The index is expected to have risen 0.94% from June, based on preliminary data, the Government Statistics Office said. 

  A Ministry of Agriculture official said food prices were higher because Vietnam's key winter-spring rice crop produced only 17.1 million tons of paddy rice, down 3% on year. 

  Bird flu and bacterial infections among pigs have also hurt many farmers across the country, resulting in higher prices for foodstuffs in many provinces in Vietnam, the official said. 

  Food and food services prices are expected to have climbed 11.13% on year and 1.59% on month. Rice and other cereal prices are projected to have risen 15.03% on year, and 0.54% on month. 

  Housing and construction materials costs are estimated to have increased 10.93% on year and risen 0.73% on month. 

  Vietnam is aiming for a full-year inflation rate below its gross domestic product growth rate, which is targeted at 8.5% this year. 

  The subindex that measures prices in cities is estimated to have risen 8.98% from a year earlier and 0.84% from June. Prices in rural areas are estimated to be 7.81% higher than a year earlier and up 0.97% from June. 

  Gold prices probably rose 5.51% on year and were down 0.59% on month. 

  The statistics office also said that the U.S. dollar will have gained 0.95% against the Vietnamese dong since July last year, and 0.12% since June of this year. The central bank set the dollar's value Monday at VND16,139. 

  The government usually issues CPI figures based on estimates before the end of the reporting period. 

 
                      On Yr     On Mo 
Nationwide CPI       +8.39%    +0.94% 
Urban CPI            +8.98%    +0.84%

277,"WSJ(8/13) Europe Braces For Food Crunch

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Joellen Perry 

  Frankfurt -- The global rise in food prices is catching up with continental Europe, adding to mounting inflation worries and forcing changes to European Union agriculture policy. 

  Rising global food demand, freakish weather and the trend to reroute crops for biofuels are pushing up food-commodity prices globally. Standard & Poor's GSCI Excess Return Index, which measures the price movements of eight agriculture commodities -- including wheat, sugar and corn -- is up 10% in the past year. 

  European shoppers are looking at some particularly stiff increases. Germany's Dairy Industry Association said earlier this month that domestic prices for milk-based products such as butter could jump as much as 50% this year. Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever said soaring global edible-oil and dairy prices will increase its costs by more than 600 million euros ($821.8 million) this year and boost prices for products such as margarine. Italy's Association of Pasta Manufacturers said last month that a durum-wheat squeeze will increase domestic pasta prices by 20% this fall. 

  While food-price inflation in many major economies has accelerated, the impact in the 13 countries that share the euro currency has been muted so far. Annual euro-zone food-price inflation was 2.1% in June, compared with 4.8% in the United Kingdom and 4.1% in the U.S. In Japan, where other prices keep falling, the annual inflation rate for food excluding perishables was 0.3% in June. Japan's Q.P. Corp., for instance, lifted mayonnaise prices for businesses and consumers by about 10% in June. 

  Some economists say the strong euro has shielded the euro zone from some price increases. Most food commodities are priced in dollars, so a stronger euro makes those products cheaper for European buyers. The euro has risen nearly 4% against the dollar since the start of the year and now hovers near record highs around $1.37. And in contrast to the U.K., where a strong pound also damps commodity-price inflation, euro-zone consumer demand has been relatively weak, deterring producers and supermarkets from raising prices. 

  That is changing. ""Euro-zone growth has picked up and is therefore increasing the pricing power of retailers,"" says Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. Mr. Nielsen notes that falling unemployment could boost domestic consumption across the bloc. Rising food prices could be particularly relevant for the European Central Bank and borrowers across the continent. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB, which sets euro-zone monetary policy, focuses on ""headline"" inflation -- that is, inflation with volatile food and energy costs included. That has some fretting that the bloc's inflation rate will rise further than expected. 

  ""We're concerned,"" says Nick Matthews, economist with Barclays Capital in London. Mr. Matthews expects inflation to hit 2.4% later this year, above the ECB's 2% ceiling, and says higher food prices could bump the rate up further. 

  Before last week's global credit crunch, which prompted the ECB to pump 213.6 billion euros into euro-zone money markets, most economists expected the bank to raise interest rates to 4.25% in September from 4%, as inflation pressures, including rising energy costs and robust economic growth, mount. 

  But if market turbulence continues and the ECB keeps injecting money into the system, a September rate increase is less likely. 

  While food prices are rising across the bloc, Germans may feel a particular pinch. German dairy farmers have paid heavy fines -- 134 million euros in 2005 -- for ignoring EU milk-production quotas but now largely produce within legal limits, a change that is squeezing supply. 

  Particularly slack domestic demand has also kept retail prices low. Last year, German prices for milk, cheese and eggs were just 87% of the EU average. ""Germany, in particular, has room to catch up,"" says Barclays's Mr. Matthews. But rising prices there ""reflect supply pressures across the board,"" he says. 

  Overall, the factors pushing up euro-zone food prices mirror the dynamics at work globally. The push to use some crops to produce biofuels is one culprit; changing weather patterns are another. Australia's continuing drought means farmers there can't fulfill as many orders. European farmers are stepping in, particularly to meet milk-product demand. 

  Fast growth and changing palates in developing countries are also to blame. Germany is by far the EU's largest dairy producer, and its milk-product exports -- from whey powder to soft cheese -- to Eastern Europe, developing Asia and oil-producing countries has skyrocketed. The value of German milk and cream exports to Hungary rose to 29 million euros last year from 1.6 million euros in 2002; the value of whey-powder exports to China over the same period jumped to 5.5 million euros from 247,000 euros. 

  Economists expect global demand to keep climbing, as developing-market consumers continue shifting their eating habits from basics like bread to fare such as cheese and meat. Until those countries develop the capacity to meet their own demand, economists say prices will continue to rise. 

  The food-price jump has already prompted the EU to cut some subsidies. For years, high labor and production costs have kept European dairy prices above those in the rest of the world. 

  In response, the EU used to offer dairy farmers refunds to make up the difference on products they exported at lower prices. In 2004, those refunds totaled 1.5 billion euros. With global prices rising, the EU started phasing out the program last year. 

  For Europe, economists say, it is the dawn of a new era. ""Suddenly, there's a factor that was never visible in the domestic market,"" says Stefan Tangermann, director for food, agriculture and fisheries at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ""That is: What do the Chinese eat?""

278,"Ecuador Aims To Boost Oil Export Revenues -Petroecuador Exec

 

  (This article was originally published Wednesday) 

 
   By Mercedes Alvaro 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  QUITO (Dow Jones)--Ecuador has started testing markets to try and improve revenues from oil exports, and isn't ruling out a change in the way it prices crude oil sales, a high-level official with state-owned Petroecuador said Wednesday. 

  ""We want to be closer to the market so that buyers have the possibility to buy under the best conditions. We are now carrying out spot sales. We could also make contracts for two or three months with a fixed discount, including changing the benchmark,"" Petroecuador's manager of international trade, Carlos Izurieta, told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. 

  Izurieta said that among the oil benchmarks they could choose from are Maya from Mexico and Merey from Venezuela. 

  ""But this will depend on the next months of monitoring the market. As of now, we are trying to and will continue to try to capture what the market is quoting in order to optimize our profits,"" he said. 

  Izurieta added that the state has begun monitoring the effects of spot sales since May with Napo crude oil, from Occidental Oil Company's (OXY) former fields, and since July with Oriente crude. 

  Petroecuador already said that it has stopped using the formula that includes the discount fixed by Platts and Argus, plus a premium offered by the company interested in the oil. 

  Now the buyer must directly offer a discount on West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, and the crude is awarded to those who offer the lowest discount. Ecuadorian crude is heavier than the WTI benchmark, and sells at a discount. 

  It will take six months of market analysis before a decision on pricing is made, he said. 

  Meanwhile, Petroecuador continues to negotiate with oil refineries in Peru, Costa Rica and Chile to sign long-term contracts, for 14,000, 6,000 and 24,000 barrels a day of Oriente, respectively. 

  In July, Petroecuador spot sold 400,000 barrels to Chile ""as part of what could be a long-term relationship, in which we are discussing prices, including what part intermediaries take. We are analyzing what are the greatest factors that affect the price."" 

  Izurieta said one idea would be to fix the price, but to have adjustments every two or three months according to market conditions and factors that the two parties agree upon. 

  As part of the new marketing policy, this past week Petroecuador called a meeting to sell 19 shipments of 360,000 barrels of Oriente oil that would be shipped between September and October. The offer's outcome will be known on Thursday. 

  Ecuador exports some 120,000 barrels of Oriente oil a day, with an API grade of 23.5 and a sulfur level of 1.5%. 

  Additionally, it exports 40,000 barrels a day of Napo, and Ecuador has an agreement with Venezuela to exchange 22,000 barrels a day of Napo crude for Venezuelan oil derivatives. 

  Although Ecuador produces around 504,000 barrels a day, it doesn't have sufficient capacity to cover internal demand for oil derivatives.

279,"Barron&apos;s(8/6) Commodities Corner: Exports Show Flour Power

   (From BARRON'S) 
   By Tom Polansek 

  Countries hungry for wheat don't have many options on the menu of global suppliers these days, forcing many to order from the U.S. despite steep prices. 

  But this recent export boom could come to an end soon if importers back away from the table after front-loading their purchases. There's also the risk that end users will lose their appetites if prices climb too high. 

  The U.S. has profited from big export sales recently because few other major wheat-producing countries have surpluses of grain to sell. Weather has caused crop losses in several key growing areas of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe and the Black Sea region, and the Southern Hemisphere won't harvest its wheat until fall. 

  Some U.S. wheat growers suffered this spring from rains in the Southern Plains. But in the Northern Plains, crops of hard-red spring wheat, used for bread, and durum wheat, for pasta, are in above-average condition ahead of harvest. 

  And up to now, the weak dollar has done its bit to attract foreign grain buyers. 

  In the week ended July 19, the U.S. racked up its highest export sales of wheat since June 1996, according to the Agriculture Department. Some of the buying countries weren't names that pop up frequently; Bangladesh, for example, made its first purchase of U.S. hard-red-winter wheat since the 1999-2000 marketing season. 

  The strong sales weren't just a one-time bonanza, either. Last week's business was robust, too. 

  ""The end users overseas are locking in grain because they absolutely, positively have to have it,"" says Dave Marshall, a commodities broker and independent marketing adviser in Nashville, Ill. ""Where else can they get it right now?"" 

  Sales continue strong even though wheat futures are trading at their highest prices in more than a decade. Chicago Board of Trade September wheat ended at $6.50 per bushel Friday, down 31/4 cents on the week, but up from $3.96 a year ago. ""It's been most impressive how these exports have held up,"" declares Jason Britt, a broker and analyst with Central State Commodities in Kansas City, Mo. 

  Some traders argue export sales have reached an ""unsustainable pace"" and will have to drop off eventually. One theory is that importers have engaged in a bit of fear buying and are just covering their wheat needs until Australia and Argentina harvest their crops. 

  Prices also could reach a pain threshold for end users that would cause a reduction in demand. Sentimentwise, ""you'd probably get people really anxious if you get wheat to the $7 mark,"" says Dale Durchholz, senior analyst with AgriVisor in Bloomington, Ill. 

  Britt, on the other hand, isn't so sure that even reaching that psychologically important price level would be the breaking point for end users. With historically tight global supplies, it's hard to put a price level on hunger, he observes. 

  ""People still have to eat,"" he says. 

  Nymex crude-oil touched an intraday record high Wednesday of $78.70 a barrel -- but the September contract settled Friday at $75.48, notching down $1.54 on the week.

  SEOUL (Dow Jones)--South Korean producer prices rose last month, largely because of a rise in service charges and prices of manufactured goods, the Bank of Korea said Thursday. 

  The producer price index climbed 0.2% from June as increased commission charges in the wake of a booming stock market pushed up services charges while higher international oil costs and petroleum product costs boosted the prices of manufactured goods, the central bank said. 

  On year, the index gained 2.4%, compared with a 2.7% increase in June. The June reading was the biggest rise since September last year, when it rose 3.1%. 

  The PPI measures the wholesale prices of a basket of 923 goods and services bought and sold by South Korean companies.

281,"WSJ(8/16) One Family&apos;s Journey Into A Subprime Trap

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By James R. Hagerty and Ken Gepfert 

  FULLERTON, Calif. -- Nearly two years ago, Mario and Leticia Montes found a home they loved, a gray stucco bungalow with a hot tub in the backyard in a middle-class neighborhood of Orange County. 

  The price was a major stretch at $567,000. But the couple, who had sold a home a few years earlier to move to a better area, were tired of renting. Mr. and Mrs. Montes convened a meeting with their two teenage daughters around the kitchen table to hash out the implications. ""We agreed we wanted to be homeowners again,"" says Mr. Montes, ""even if it meant the end of vacations and not eating out as often."" 

  Like many people who jumped into the rising housing market in recent years, they had little money for a down payment and chose a loan that would hold their monthly payments down for the first two years, then ""reset"" to a much higher level. Mr. and Mrs. Montes say their mortgage broker assured them they would be able to refinance in a couple of years to keep their payments affordable. 

  With a December ""reset"" on their loan looming, however, the refinancing option now looks impossible. A friend who works as a loan officer called with some bad news this week: Similar homes in their area have been selling for $535,000 to $565,000 recently. That means the Monteses' loan balance may exceed the value of their home. 

  The Monteses are caught in a trap -- one that hundreds of thousands of people could face as the housing market totters and the easy credit of recent years dries up. They in effect bet that the boom in housing prices would continue. It was more important to hop onto the escalator than to wait until they could afford to make the leap according to traditional measures. 

  And with thousands of mortgage banks and brokers threatened with extinction, lenders that embraced all kinds of risky loans two years ago are enforcing increasingly strict standards. They are refusing even to consider extending new credit to people like the Monteses who lack any equity in their homes. 

  ""We have a disaster on our hands,"" says Mr. Montes, a 48-year-old warehouse manager. He fears he won't be able to handle the payments after the December reset and wonders whether the family can avert foreclosure. ""At this point,"" he says, ""we really don't have a plan."" 

  Until recently, the Montes family didn't seem like the type that would find itself faced with foreclosure. They live in a solid neighborhood and are both employed and in good health. ""My wife and I make pretty good money,"" says Mr. Montes. Mrs. Montes works as a school secretary. Together, they earned nearly $90,000 last year. 

  But they already pay about $38,400 a year on their home loans, even before taxes and insurance. In December, when their primary loan ""resets"" to a higher rate, that cost will rise to about $50,000 a year, Mr. Montes says. 

  Lenders have been tightening their standards for the past year in the face of rising defaults and growing jitters among the investors who provide funding for loans. That tightening has accelerated in the past two weeks as many lenders -- uncertain at what price they might be able to sell loans -- have stopped making all but the safest ones. 

  ""It's getting worse and worse,"" says Jeff Lazerson, chief executive of Mortgage Grader, a mortgage broker in Laguna Niguel, who tried to help the Montes family last spring but concluded even then that they couldn't qualify for a new loan. Many people who have been counting on a refinancing to ease their debt burdens will find that's now impossible, he says: ""It's either work 24 hours a day to make ends meet [with the existing loan] or mail the keys back to the bank."" 

  Being stuck with little or no home equity is no longer a rare situation. Christopher Cagan, director of research at First American CoreLogic, a housing and mortgage data supplier in Santa Ana, recently found that nearly 7% of 32 million U.S. households studied as of December owed more than their homes were worth, based on computer estimates of the property values. An additional 4% had home equity of 5% or less. Since then, house prices have edged down in much of the country, erasing more home equity. 

  Without a cushion of equity, homeowners are vulnerable to losing their homes to foreclosure if they suddenly are out of work, suffer a serious illness or, like the Montes family, face a jump in mortgage payments. 

  Partly as a result, foreclosures are surging. Moody's Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., projects that lenders will acquire about 760,000 homes through foreclosure this year and 935,000 in 2008, up from an average of about 440,000 a year from 2000 through 2006. 

  When the Monteses decided to buy the bungalow in 2005, they had only a so-so credit record and little savings. So they settled for a ""subprime"" loan, with costlier terms than those available in the prime market. 

  The Monteses' primary loan is the type that became the dominant subprime mortgage during the housing boom of the first half of this decade -- and now has become a symbol of misguided lending, swept away by regulatory fiat and investors' flight from mortgages deemed too risky. These loans are known in the trade as 2/28 mortgages. The interest rate is fixed at a relatively low rate for the first two years (5.45% in the Monteses' case), then floats at a predetermined margin above an interest-rate index for the next 28 years. In many cases, that ""reset"" of the interest rate after two years leads to a monthly payment increase of 30% or more. 

  U.S. lenders originated about $600 billion of subprime home loans in 2006, or 20% of all home mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. About 56% of those subprime loans were 2/28 mortgages, says Keith Ernst, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit research and lobbying group in Durham, N.C. 

  The lending industry touted the 2/28 loans as ""affordability"" mortgages, because they helped people buy houses that wouldn't have been affordable with the higher immediate payments on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. To make the loans even more affordable in the early years, they were often structured as ""interest-only,"" meaning that principal payments were deferred until later. 

  Lenders sometimes described these loans as ""credit-repair tools."" The idea was that people with blemished credit records could take out a 2/28 subprime loan and keep up with the payments long enough to improve their credit records and qualify for a less-costly prime loan. 

  Earlier this year, regulators ordered subprime lenders to make such loans based on the borrower's ability to afford the loan after the reset, not just for the initial two years, as was the common practice. That change, along with tighter guidelines from rating agencies and risk-aversion among investors, has recently prompted major subprime lenders to stop making 2/28 loans. Instead, they are making more subprime loans that carry a fixed rate for at least five years, as well as ones that hold down payments by stretching the payments over 40 years instead of 30. 

  The Montes family got their loan through a mortgage broker in Rancho Cucamonga. Using what was then a common formula, the broker offered to arrange for two loans, one to cover about 80% of the home price and the other, a so-called piggyback loan, for the rest. For the first two years, their total monthly mortgage payments are about $3,200. The loans are interest-only. 

  Mr. Montes recalls feeling edgy about whether he would be able to afford the higher costs -- about $900 more per month -- due to take effect after two years. But he says the broker assured him he could refinance before those costs kicked in. 

  Mr. Montes preferred not to name the broker publicly because the broker has a business connection with a relative of the Monteses. The broker declined to comment. 

  Mrs. Montes says she was apprehensive about the broker's assurances. ""But I blame that on that I don't understand the lingo they were talking,"" she says. ""It's a scary experience. . . . All I could see was all these numbers flash before me. . . . I said, 'Mario, I hope you don't get into something that is going to hurt us.'"" 

  They moved into their home and hung a sign on the front door reading, ""Life is a daily celebration of love."" Within months, things started going wrong. The Monteses received a letter informing them their property taxes had been reassessed based on the $567,000 sale price instead of its previous $389,000 value. That raised their taxes to $6,000 from $2,900 a year and would have increased their monthly payments (including the mortgages and taxes) to $3,931. ""Whoa!"" Mr. Montes recalls saying. ""I can't afford this. I went into emergency mode."" 

  He was able to successfully challenge part of the tax increase, but another shock came in late February of this year when he began looking at refinancing possibilities. Mr. Montes says four brokers -- including the one who arranged the original loan -- turned him away, saying it wouldn't be possible to refinance because, with home prices flat at best, the family had little or no equity in the home. Worse for the Monteses, they learned that they faced a $12,000 prepayment penalty if they refinanced within three years of the original mortgages -- something that Mr. Montes says wasn't made clear to him when he took out those loans. 

  Then another broker told him in March that his home had gained enough in value for him to qualify for a more affordable loan. They paid for an appraisal and were told their home was worth $620,000, or about $53,000 more than they paid in 2005. The Monteses were jubilant, thinking their home was saved. But more than three months later, the broker outlined a package that would have involved payments far higher than indicated in earlier meetings.

282,"WSJ(9/29) China Will Moderately Tighten Monetary Policy

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 

  BEIJING -- China's central bank on Friday said it will continue to moderately tighten monetary policy amid inflation pressures, even as it closely monitors the potential impact of U.S. subprime-mortgage problems on global financial markets and China itself. 

  The comments, in a summary of the People's Bank of China's third-quarter monetary-policy-board meeting, highlight that Beijing is weighing the risk of a domestic economic slowdown because of problems in the U.S. financial sector against the imperative to prevent China's economy from overheating, including curbing consumer-price and asset-price inflation. 

  At the moment, the PBOC's focus remains mainly on the domestic economy, and in the summary it said it ""will continue to implement a monetary policy with a moderate tightening bias."" 

  The summary, posted on the PBOC's Web site, comes after the August consumer-price index surged 6.5% from a year earlier, the fastest gain in more than 10 years, and as prices in the local share market reach records, raising the risk that an asset bubble might be forming. 

  China's growth in its gross domestic product is likely to continue its fast clip in the second half, bringing GDP growth for the year to 11.6% and the inflation rate to 4.6%, a report by PBOC researchers said Friday. 

  The PBOC in the summary said it needs to analyze the reasons behind the ""relatively fast"" rises in consumer and asset prices. China will continue to keep credit and money-supply growth at reasonable levels and strengthen liquidity management, it said. 

  The bank reiterated that China will continue to increase the flexibility of the yuan, while keeping the local currency unit's ""basic stability"" around a reasonable level. 

  The PBOC said the problems in the U.S. subprime-mortgage sector have had a limited impact on China so far, but it will ""closely monitor"" any impact the turmoil has on the global financial sector and on China itself. A slowdown in the U.S. economy could affect Chinese export growth. 

  The PBOC summary said too-fast investment and credit growth combined with excessive trade surpluses remain problems. It said China will promote a basic balance in the country's external payments, reiterating Beijing's policy stance.

283,"Venezuela August CPI Up 1.1% Vs 1.5% In Survey -2-

 

  Products and services with the highest price variations last month included alcoholic drinks and tobacco with a 4.5% increase, food and non-alcoholic beverages up 2.3%, and restaurant and hotel services with a 1.3% rise. Meanwhile, communications services saw prices fall 0.3%, in part due to the state's decision to cut prices for phone service after nationalizing the country's largest telecom company, CA Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela. 

  Venezuela's central bank pointed out that the CPI's climb was fueled by higher prices for goods with no price controls, which surged 1.8% last month. Products subject to price regulation, on the other hand, inched up 0.2%. 

  President Hugo Chavez has vowed to deliver a 12% inflation rate at year-end, a goal economists argue is wishful thinking, especially since inflationary pressures build up as the year draws to a close. Economists expect the CPI rise to end closer to 17%, the same as last year. 

  Chavez has imposed price controls on a series of goods, his main tool to keep prices in check. Lately he has also offered subsidies to those producers who keep prices unchanged even in the face of rising costs. He has also threatened businesses with expropriation if they violate price controls. 

  In one of his latest moves, Chavez cut the value added tax twice this year to 9% from 11%, in hopes of slowing price markups in the oil-rich economy. Indeed, the latest cut became effective in July and the CPI rise posted as a result was 0.5%. 

  His administration lately prohibited schools from raising their tuition fees but many of them are negotiating with parents hoping to find alternatives to alleviate costs. 

  A robust black market dollar, however, has become a stone in Chavez's shoe. The price for the greenback in the parallel market now stands at 4,900 bolivars per dollar, more than twice the official rate of VEB2,150. Venezuelans turn to the black market to obtain more dollars than the government makes available as part of a capital controls policy created in 2003 to curtail capital flight. High dollar prices have become a factor pushing up inflation in this import-dependent nation.

284,"WSJ(9/13) Commodities Report: $80 Oil May Be Tough To Bear

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Ann Davis 

  With pit traders screaming, ""Go, go, go"" -- and economists sounding alarms -- the world oil benchmark price briefly topped $80 a barrel yesterday for the first time. 

  Last year, when crude was at similar levels, prices retreated and the economy stayed resilient. But this year, there are some significant differences, triggering concerns that prices could be headed higher and that the economy could be vulnerable. 

  One main distinction: This time around, the economy isn't looking quite as healthy amid concerns about the weakened housing market and mortgage defaults. 

  In addition, in 2006, oil inventories were higher because of market incentives to store oil, which meant energy buyers had a stockpile. By contrast, today, different market incentives have led to much lower oil inventories in key regions. 

  That's troublesome, because the lack of a stockpile cushion means that any supply crunch could lead buyers -- oil refiners and speculators alike -- to quickly bid up crude-oil prices beyond $80 a barrel, just as the economy appears vulnerable to recession. 

  Indeed, oil stockpiles have continued to drain quickly as prices for ""spot,"" or today's-price, oil far outpace prices for delivery a few months from now. Yesterday, the Energy Information Administration reported a higher-than-expected reduction in crude inventories last week. 

  Yesterday, after hitting $80.18 in intraday trading, the New York Mercantile Exchange's crude-futures contract settled at $79.91, up $1.68, or 2.1%. While that is an exchange record, oil has been higher in inflation-adjusted terms: The inflation-adjusted record is $101.57, hit in April 1980. 

  News yesterday that the Houston Ship Channel, which serves five refineries and multiple chemical plants, closed ahead of Tropical Storm Humberto also helped propel prices. 

  But clues that oil could touch $80 surfaced the day before, when markets rallied even after an announced production boost from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Many observers perceived the 500,000-barrel-a-day rise as stingy in the face of growing demand. 

  ""The idea of OPEC bringing on just 500,000 barrels a day, and not until November, is like Ben Bernanke saying maybe we should lower interest rates 1/10th of 1%: It has no relevance,"" said Matt Simmons of Simmons & Co., an energy investment bank in Houston, and author of a controversial book contending Saudi oil reserves are less prolific than claimed. 

  In addition, it takes an estimated two months for extra tankers to reach the U.S. from the Middle East. 

  ""We believe the door to $80 and beyond remains open and beckons,"" said Barclays energy analysts Paul Horsnell and Kevin Norrish in a note yesterday. 

  The big question is what impact $80 oil prices will have on the economy. Some oil-field services stocks rallied, but other stocks sank, including airlines that get socked by higher jet-fuel prices. 

  Even refiners could get hurt, the Barclays analysts pointed out: Gasoline inventories are within a hair of their lowest levels since 2000, and profits from converting oil to fuel shrink with higher crude prices. 

  If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, as it is expected to do next week, that could weaken the dollar and give oil-producing organizations further excuses to try to keep prices high, since they will be getting paid in less-valuable dollars, argues Larry Goldstein, director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation, an industry-funded, nonprofit research organization. 

  Canadian oil producers could be winners if oil prices stay high and the U.S. needs more crude quickly. Heavy-oil-sands projects are profitable at today's oil prices, and producers could ship more down to the Midwest, as more refineries start to retool their plants to process the heavy stuff. 

  But the U.S. can't absorb and use this heavy crude all that quickly, because there still are limited pipelines that can get it to the Gulf Coast refining centers, and many refineries both in the Midwest and near the Gulf still can't take it. 

  Other commodity markets provide ominous clues. Copper markets, for example, have typically been sensitive to U.S. recessions and housing slowdowns, because the metal is used in housing products, electric supplies and electronics. But such a large percentage of consumption has shifted to Asia that analysts are suggesting copper inventories are likely to start dropping again after a seasonal slowdown, whether or not the U.S. is using more of it, and prices could rise. Oil may do the same thing. 

  In other commodity markets: 

 

  NATURAL GAS: Futures shot up 8.7%, driven by fears that Atlantic tropical storms could disrupt Gulf of Mexico energy production. Near-month October natural gas on the Nymex rose 51.3 cents to $6.438 a million British thermal units. 

 

  SOYBEANS: Futures at the Chicago Board of Trade rose on supportive crop-production data, pushing prices to their highest level since 2004. Nearby September soybeans gained 20 cents to $9.25. 

 

  WHEAT: CBOT prices fell, with some contracts falling to the daily price limit of 30 cents. Nearby September fell 31 cents to $8.40 a bushel; because the contract is in delivery, price limits were removed.

285,"UPDATE: Mexico 2008 Budget Plan Sees 3.5% GDP Growth In 2008

 

  (Updates with details throughout) 

 

  MEXICO CITY (Dow Jones)-Mexico's Finance Ministry submitted the government's 2008 budget proposal to Congress Saturday, saying it expects gross domestic product to grow 3.5% next year. 

  The 2.39 trillion peso ($215 billion) spending proposal is up 3.3% in real terms from the budget approved for 2007, the ministry said. 

  The ministry said economic growth could be 3.7% next year if the Congress passes a proposed tax reform, which it estimated would add about MXN115 billion to next year's revenue, with the proceeds being used for investment and social spending. 

  In the proposal, the ministry also lowered its economic growth estimate for 2007 to 3% from 3.3%, attributing the lower forecast to an expected slowdown in the U.S. as a result of the recent financial market turmoil and the lack of recovery in the U.S. real estate sector. Mexico's economy grew 4.8% in 2006. 

  The ministry estimated that the average price of Mexico's export crude, a significant contributor to government revenue, would be $46.60 a barrel in 2008, with state oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, expected to export on average 1.68 million barrels a day of crude oil. 

  The ministry estimated that Pemex's export crude will average $54.60 a barrel in 2007, with Pemex exporting 1.73 million barrels a day out of total production of 3.14 million barrels a day. Pemex current crude production is about 3.16 million barrels a day. 

  The Congress is close to reaching agreement on a tax reform, although a vote on the bill was delayed last week by disagreements over a plan to raise gasoline and diesel prices, and by lack of agreement among parties on an electoral reform that the three main parties had agreed to pass at the same time as the fiscal reform. 

  Finance Minister Agustin Carstens handed in the budget plan in person, urging legislators to pass a tax reform to make for a more effective budget, given the country's spending needs. 

  ""This is particularly important faced with a fiscal year in which significant challenges are expected,"" he said. 

  In its budget outline, the ministry warned that although the plan projects a balanced budget, the public sector will probably end next year with a deficit as a result of the recent reform of the state workers pension and social security system. The amount will depend on how many workers choose to switch to individual accounts from the existing defined benefits system, and won't be known until next September, the ministry said. 

  The short-term transition costs of the pension reform will outweigh immediate savings, although savings in the medium term will change that situation, the ministry said, adding that the executive branch can adjust spending or issue debt to meet the commitments. 

  Speaking at a press conference in Australia, President Felipe Calderon said that if a tax reform is approved in the coming days or weeks, the additional revenue could be added to next year's spending plan. He said areas that could benefit from the extra money include road, port, and water infrastructure, higher education, health services, Pemex and state electric utility Comision Federal de Electricidad, according to a transcript from the presidential press office.

287,"US HIGH-GRADE DEBT: Investors Snap Up New Issues Quickly

 

  By Romy Varghese 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The high-grade corporate bond market continued its upbeat attitude Wednesday, as new issues were bought quickly and a benchmark of confidence tightened. 

  The investment-grade credit derivatives CDX index, which represents 125 credit default swaps, tightened to 51 basis points, according to Jim Cusser, portfolio manager at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. It closed Tuesday at 53 basis points, according to Markit, the administrator of the index. 

  Cusser said investors such as himself are eager for high-quality bonds issued by companies other than financial institutions. But such deals aren't abundant, and when they get to the market, ""they're getting snapped up,"" he said. 

  For instance, a $750 million two-part offering from Clorox was launched and priced quickly Wednesday. And a $300 million, 10-year deal from Florida Power and Light Co. went in about 20 minutes and was 10 times oversubscribed, according to a syndicate source, who added it felt like a deal before the summer credit crunch. 

  Cusser said the volume of issuance so far has been ""something of a mirage"" because a lot of it was refinancing older debt from financial institutions. 

  Next on the market's watch are several important releases of U.S. economic data: jobless claims data Thursday and the unemployment rate and consumer credit report Friday. Such reports give investors insight into the strength of the economy. 

 

  U.S. Treasurys 

 

  Suspicion the labor market may not be in all that much peril gnawed at Treasurys Wednesday, as the market failed to make up the losses sparked by a stronger-than-expected services sector survey. 

  All maturities finished a little worse than where they started the session, with the two-year yield at 4%, and the 10-year at 4.55%. 

  The impetus behind the selling was the latest Institute for Supply Management report, which showed activity in the dominant services sector grew at a slower pace in September. The drop in the index - from 55.8 to 54.8 - would normally be bond-positive, but the report also pointed to a quickening in inflationary pressures. Its prices index rose to 66.1, from 58.6 the month before. 

 

  U.S. Agencies 

 

  Risk premiums on short-term agency debt were tighter Wednesday. Coming in around 2 basis points higher over Treasurys were Freddie Mac's (FRE) 5% issue due 2009 and Federal Home Loan Bank's (FHLB) 4.5% due 2009. 

  Risk premiums on longer-term agency paper were little changed, with 30-year paper issued by Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) tightening by less than half a basis point. 

 

  U.S. Asset-Backed Securities 

 

   A $2 billion credit-card backed deal dubbed BACCT 2007-A13 has sold at 22 basis points over one-month Libor, according to IFR Asset-Backed Securities. Delivery is scheduled for Oct. 12. Banc of America Securities was the lead manager. The deal was increased in size from an original $1 billion. 

  A $1.25 billion deal titled CHAIT 07-A17, also backed by credit-card debt, is on offer via JP Morgan.

288,"UPDATE: China To Up Reserve Ratio;Signals Tightening Resolve

 

  (Adds details, analyst comments) 

 

  By Terence Poon 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--China's central bank said Saturday it will raise banks' required reserves for the eighth time this year to drain excess liquidity and control credit growth, as it tries to prevent the economy from overheating. 

  The reserve requirement ratio - the share of deposits lenders must keep with the central bank - will rise 50 basis points to 13.0% for most commercial banks from Oct. 25. 

  The move to raise the reserve ratio follows trade and money-supply data issued Friday showing still-rapid economic growth. The move also comes before the 17th Communist Party Congress, China's most important political meeting, opens Monday. 

  The timing is likely intended to demonstrate the central bank's quick responsiveness to data and its determination to tighten policy despite the party meeting, a period when stability is key and policy moves aren't expected. 

  In a statement on its Web site, the People's Bank of China said it is increasing the ratio to ""strengthen management of liquidity in the banking system and restrain overly rapid growth of credit."" 

  Beijing has been trying to contain surging asset prices and accelerating consumer price inflation, as well as bring economic growth to a more sustainable pace, as China's vast trade surpluses continue to pump liquidity into a domestic financial system already flush with funds. 

  Despite increasing its pace of tightening, with five rate hikes introduced so far this year, Beijing hasn't yet been able to slow the economy and will likely tighten again. 

  The trade surplus, a key source of domestic liquidity, remained high at US$23.91 billion in September. China's broadest measure of money supply, M2, was up 18.45% at the end of September from the same time last year, accelerating from a 18.09% gain at the end of August. 

  Citigroup economist Shen Minggao said the central bank will likely raise interest rates once more this year and also raise the reserve ratio - though there isn't much room left to increase the ratio further, given that a high ratio hurts the country's commercial banks. 

  Including Saturday's hike, the PBOC has raised banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points 11 times since July 2006. The last reserve ratio hike took effect Sept. 25.

289,"2nd UPDATE: ABB 3Q Net +86% On Infrastructure Demand

(Adds detail, comments and share price.) 

 
   By Goran Mijuk 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  ZURICH (Dow Jones)--ABB Ltd. (ABB) Thursday reported an 86% jump in third-quarter net profit on soaring demand for power and automation projects, and said the global infrastructure boom will continue to boost the engineering company's earnings during the next few months. 

  The Zurich-based company said net profit for the July-to-September period rose to $738 million from $397 million a year earlier as the company was also able to curb costs and increase prices. 

  The figure beat analysts' expectations for a bottom line result of $650 million as ABB benefited from a lower tax rate and lower financial costs as it continued to cut its debt. 

  ""Demand for power and automation projects as well as growing concern about global warming is fueling demand for our products,"" Chief Executive Fred Kindle said during a conference call. 

  ""If markets stay as they are, we expect to improve our performance further,"" he added. ABB in September set out new operational targets for the period 2007 to 2011, expecting sales to grow between 8% to 11% and the operating margin to move within a band of 11% to 16% during the period. 

  The company Thursday said orders for the quarter jumped 33% to $8.32 billion from $6.28 billion a year-earlier, while sales improved 26% to $7.19 billion from $5.68 billion, beating ABB's own targets as well as market expectations. The operating margin, meanwhile, jumped to 14.4% from 11.8% a year-ago. 

  The strong figures and the promising outlook helped ABB to outperform the overall Swiss market. At 0909 GMT, shares were up 1.8 Swiss francs, or 3.4%, at CHF33.28. ABB's shares have gained almost 50% so far this year. 

  ABB said high demand for new infrastructure projects in China, India and the Middle East, where governments and companies need to install fresh power-distribution equipment or industrial processing sites, has continued to thrive. 

  ABB also benefited from strong demand in Europe, where the market is interested in investing in new, energy-efficient technologies that help companies save energy and costs. 

  In September, for example, ABB received an order worth $400 million to provide equipment that will connect the world's largest wind park in the North Sea with the German electricity grid. 

  ""These are again excellent figures. And the outlook is also promising as ABB has extended the time horizon in regard to the infrastructure boom,"" said Panagiotis Spiliopoulos, analyst at Bank Vontobel, who rates the stock a buy. 

  ABB had said it expected its markets to develop strongly throughout 2007, and now believes this trend will stay in place over the next nine months, with the strongest growth expected in Asia, followed by Europe and the U.S. 

  ""We have the capacity to meet this demand,"" Kindle said, adding that ABB still had ample capacity in emerging markets such as Poland or the Czech Republic, easing market concerns that the high demand could lead to production bottlenecks. 

  ""Besides the strong operational performance, ABB also produced a very strong cash flow"", said Mark Diethelm, analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank, who rates the stock at buy. 

  ABB, whose cash flow development has been weak in the past few years, said third-quarter cash flow rose 69.4% to $886 million, helping ABB's net cash position to jump around $1 billion to $3.3 billion. 

  The net cash position is expected to rise even more in the fourth quarter when ABB will receive around $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of its oil and gas unit Lummus, giving it ample ammunition for a potential acquisition. 

  ""We still want to grow organically and via acquisitions,"" CEO Kindle said, adding that if ABB doesn't find a suitable acquisition target it could consider a share buyback.

  Economy: 

  How Fed Officials Might Perceive Interest-Rate Options 

  ---- 

  By Greg Ip 

 

  When the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday, it faces another tough choice on interest rates. Standing pat retains some appeal, given the aggressive rate cut just last month. But markets put high odds on a quarter-percentage-point rate reduction, given a string of downbeat economic and profit reports, and see a small possibility of half a point. 

  How will Fed officials assess these options? 

 

  The do-nothing case: 

  On Sept. 18, the Fed cut its target for its key short-term rate by a larger-than-expected half a point to 4.75% in a bid to ""forestall some of the adverse effects"" of a credit crunch. Many officials at the time felt that was enough -- perhaps more than enough -- to cushion the economy. Credit conditions have improved slowly. The third quarter was stronger than expected. The rest of the world remains a source of strength, especially with the lower dollar. Housing has been bad, but that was expected (though it has been worse even than lowered expectations). More important, there is still no obvious spillover from housing to the economy. On the other side, some officials have lingering concerns about inflation, especially given the cheaper dollar and higher oil prices. 

  Holding rates steady risks a bad reaction in still-edgy markets. The Fed would have to weigh that against what rate setting it feels the forecast calls for. If it remains on hold, the Fed likely will say risks are tilted toward weaker growth rather than higher inflation, keeping hope of a rate cut alive. 

 

  The quarter-point case: 

  Outside of housing, the economic forecast hasn't worsened since Sept. 18. Nonetheless, jobless claims are rising, suggesting a softening employment market. Some economically sensitive companies, such as Caterpillar Inc., have issued recession warnings. Rising unemployment and slower growth blunt the inflation threat. 

  This alone might not warrant a rate cut; that would rest on the case that risks are skewed downward, mostly from still-declining housing activity and prices. To contain those risks, the Fed might take out an ""insurance"" rate cut, a doctrine it calls ""risk management."" 

  But some officials are wary of the argument for insurance. A rate cut -- particularly if combined with a statement that hints at more --  could prompt markets to expect a string of rate cuts that the Fed doesn't envision. And some officials might dissent. 

 

  The half-point-cut case: 

  If the Fed thought still-tight credit conditions risked fueling a more dramatic fall in home prices, with spillover in the financial markets and consumer spending, it might consider an aggressive rate cut like last month. 

  But Fed officials don't have the sense of accumulating negative risks that they did in September. And, importantly, the fed-funds rate is half a point lower, as are most other rates, including rates on jumbo mortgages. Moreover, a larger-than-expected rate cut could raise questions about the Fed's anti-inflation credibility. And some outsiders worry it could fuel a run on the dollar. 

 

  Telecommunications: 

  Alcatel-Lucent Results May Be a Telltale of Fixit Strategy 

  ---- 

  By Gabriel Kahn 

 

  When Alcatel-Lucent releases third-quarter earnings results Wednesday, investors will be looking to see what strategy Chief Executive Patricia Russo has devised to lead the telecom-equipment firm out of its tailspin. 

  Since news leaked in mid-September that the board had asked Ms. Russo to present a plan to fix the firm's problems, expectations have been building among investors and analysts. The company has issued three profit warnings since Paris-based Alcatel SA and New Jersey-based Lucent Technologies completed their $13 billion merger in December 2006. The group's share price has fallen some 40%, and some analysts have called for Ms. Russo to resign. 

  But unfortunately for Ms. Russo, there doesn't appear to be any quick fix for Alcatel-Lucent's troubles. 

  The telecom-equipment business is brutally competitive. Just as new low-cost competitors from China emerge, the huge telecom operators that buy equipment have consolidated, meaning there are fewer buyers. All this has led to intense pressure on prices, hurting profits not only at Alcatel-Lucent, but also at rivals Nokia-Seimens Networks and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson. 

  One thing Ms. Russo can do is accelerate the cost-cutting undertaken as Alcatel-Lucent integrates. The company has forecast pretax cost savings of <euro>1.7 billion over three years. About half of the savings announced to date come from cutting 12,500 jobs, and the rest by reducing procurement costs, selling real estate such as offices, and eliminating overlapping products. Ms. Russo is widely expected to increase the cost-cutting in a bid to shore up Alcatel-Lucent's bottom line. 

  A tougher problem that has few easy fixes is Alcatel-Lucent's wireless division. Revenue and margins have been suffering in wireless for the past year, and some analysts see it as the heart of Alcatel-Lucent's troubles. 

  Before the merger, Alcatel's wireless products, in the GSM standard widely used in Europe, were seen as second-best to Ericsson's offerings. Lucent was strong in CDMA wireless, which rules in the U.S. With the merger, the firm aimed to strengthen its wireless portfolio. It also bought a line of products from Nortel Networks, known as UMTS technology. But stitching all three of these technologies into an attractive wireless portfolio is proving difficult. In addition, it hasn't phased out all of its overlapping products. That means it has to support and research several different technologies at once. One analyst estimates Alcatel-Lucent has five different radio-access technologies alone, and it must retain engineers to support and service all the different products. That has created an expensive mess that is hurting profitability and opening the door to competitors like Ericsson to try to poach customers. 

  But if Ms. Russo doesn't convince investors that she has a clear roadmap for how the company can emerge, she may face louder calls for her resignation. The board released a statement of support for Ms. Russo earlier in the month, and the structure of the board makes her hard to oust. A two-thirds vote of the 14 directors is required to remove her. And given the deep-seated nature of the firm's problems, it isn't clear whether a new CEO would fare much better.

292,"IMF Deppler: Euro Level Not A &quot;Big Problem&quot; For Econ Growth

 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The euro hasn't appreciated sharply against a trade-weighted basket of other currencies, and at current levels isn't a major drag on economic growth, the head of the International Monetary Fund's European department said Monday. 

  And in a report on the outlook for European economies, the IMF said the European Central bank's decision to leave its key refinancing rate on hold since the onset of the turmoil in global credit markets was ""appropriate."" 

  However, the IMF added that should credit markets return to normal soon, the ECB and other European central banks may need to raise their key interest rates to counter inflationary pressures arising from higher oil prices. 

  Although the euro lost ground against the dollar Monday, it has gained over 10% against the greenback over the last 12 months. 

  That has led to complaints from exporters about their loss of competitiveness on international markets, and renewed warnings from euro-zone policymakers of the dangers of high levels of volatility in foreign exchange markets. 

  Finance ministers from the euro zone will discuss the currency's strength against the dollar and the Chinese yuan when they meet later Monday in Brussels. 

  But, speaking at a press conference, the director of the IMF's European department said against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, the euro has appreciated much less sharply. 

  ""In our view, the value of the euro - taken on an effective basis - remains in a range where the economy is continuing to function well,"" Michael Deppler said. ""We don't see a big problem."" 

  The IMF official noted that the euro zone's current account is expected to be ""roughly balanced"" in 2008, while ""exports are doing well."" 

  In its first report on the economy of Europe as a whole, the IMF said it expects growth to slow only ""moderately"" next year. In contrast to the U.S., it expects developments in credit markets to have little effect on domestic demand, which it predicts will continue to expand at around 2.5%. 

  ""The exposure of households in the U.S. is significantly greater than it is in Europe,"" Deppler said. 

  The IMF official said with a small number of exceptions - the U.K., Spain and Ireland - housing markets in Europe are ""fairly balanced."" He added that there is no evidence of an equivalent to problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. 

  ""There are no correspondingly severe problems with lending to Europeans that we can detect,"" Deppler said. 

  The IMF said key interest rates have ""been appropriately kept on hold"" by the ECB and other European central banks while there are risks to growth from the turmoil in credit markets. But, it added that ""a further tightening may be required"" if those risks don't materialize."" 

  In particular, Deppler cited the inflationary pressures caused by rising oil prices in the context of economic growth that the IMF expects won't be much below potential at a time when the unemployment rate in many countries is low by recent historic standards. 

  The IMF said the response of central banks to the turmoil in credit markets ""has been broadly effective so far."" 

  ""Central banks will have to continue to stand ready to provide liquidity to deal with systemic risks,"" the Fund said.

293,"WSJ(11/15) UPDATE: HSBC Takes A $3.4 Billion Charge

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Margot Patrick 

  LONDON -- HSBC Holdings PLC said it took a higher-than-expected $3.4 billion impairment charge on bad debts at its HSBC Finance unit for the third quarter, but said revenue growth across the bank's global operations ""more than offset"" the charge. 

  Besides the impairment charge -- which came on top of $4.1 billion in charges for the first half -- HSBC Finance, the bank's U.S. consumer-lending business, boosted its reserves against bad mortgages to $3.4 billion from $2.6 billion. 

  Impairment charges and loss reserves at HSBC Finance are being closely watched, because it is one of the U.S.'s largest lenders to people with weak credit. 

  The bank yesterday gave a third-quarter trading update for its entire business, and reported earnings results at HSBC Finance for the period. 

  Standard & Poor's said HSBC Finance's numbers showed the first material signs of deterioration in its branch-sourced mortgages and unsecured lending. S&P revised the outlook on HSBC Holdings' double-A credit rating to stable from positive. To guard against a downgrade at HSBC Finance, HSBC said it injected $750 million into the business. 

  The bank said it expects delinquencies and defaults on mortgages within HSBC Finance to continue to rise as long as U.S. house prices keep falling. HSBC said 5.5%, or about $4.8 billion, of mortgages it services or originated were two or more payments overdue at the end of the third quarter. That compared with 4.3%, or around $3.7 billion, as of June 30.

294,"FATHOM FINANCIAL: $100 Oil Is Here, So Now What?

 

  By Danny Gabay 

  Of Fathom Financial Consulting 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--A couple of years ago, a brief discussion paper by Goldman Sachs analysts mentioned the prospect of crude oil reaching $100 per barrel. 

  At the time the price of a barrel of crude oil was just over $70. Although the media picked up on the story few investors took it too seriously. 

  Most agreed that should such an event transpire, then a global recession would be a foregone conclusion, which would bring the price of oil right back down. 

  Well, here we nearly are. This week the price of a barrel of crude oil reached $98. 

  So, is it time to panic? 

  The message from three of the world's biggest central banks this week was no, or at least not yet. 

  The Bank of England left rates on hold at 5.75%, and made no comment. We will get an insight into how the Old Lady sees the world when we see her quarterly inflation report. 

  The European Central Bank also left rates on hold, albeit at the much lower level of 4%. 

  In the press conference that followed the decision, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounded more concerned about upside inflation risks than he did about downside growth risks, though he did note the ""brutal"" rise of the euro. That looks like ECB code for ""it's gone too far."" 

  And finally, in his testimony to Congress, the Federal Reserve Board chairman warned about slowing growth but seemed to spend more time warning about the dangers of higher inflation. 

  The overall message to the markets was this: ""You're on your own, at least for now."" 

  This came as a disappointment to the markets, already reeling from the credit squeeze and now looking at the highest real oil price on record. 

  Adjusted using the U.S. gross domestic product deflator, the oil price has now passed its 1980 peak. 

  But the global economy continues to power ahead - even the supposedly ailing U.S. managed close to 4% growth in the three months to September. 

  So, has oil lost its power to shock? 

  A number of optimists say yes. 

  We were worried at $50 per barrel and nothing happened; and we worried when it hit $80 per barrel and the global economy continued to grow rapidly. So, why should we worry about $100 per barrel? 

  The most popular explanation for the belief that oil has lost its power to stop the global economy in its tracks revolves around the fact that we have become far more efficient users of oil. 

  The question of why the economy may be less vulnerable to oil price shocks today has been examined by a number of recent academic studies. 

  James Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, provides the following summary on his blog. 

  Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gali have identified four factors as all making a contribution: (a) good luck (i.e., lack of concurrent adverse shocks), (b) smaller share of oil in production, (c) more flexible labor markets and (d) improvements in monetary policy. 

  A study last year from the Congressional Budget Office emphasized a similar list of favorable developments. 

  Jerry Taylor and Peter VanDoren review some of the other evidence, and conclude: ""All the new analyses agree that the more flexible economy that we have now, allows us to cope more easily with oil price shocks.... It is time for America to get over its inordinate fear of oil shocks. Soaring prices aren't pretty, but they are scarcely the existential threat to our economy posited by many."" 

  As a share of GDP, oil consumption has certainly fallen across the developed world. That means, according to some estimates, that crude oil will need to reach $150 per barrel before it has the same potential to hurt as $90 (in today's money) did back in 1980. 

  There is a good deal of logic to this argument. Better oil efficiency must make a difference. 

  But even so, we hardly want to wait around to find out how painful $140 per barrel might be. 

  One of the key reasons that the oil shocks of the 1970s had such a devastating effect on global growth was that they were both, in the economics jargon, supply shocks. 

  When any price rises unexpectedly it can be seen as either a demand shock - excess demand pushing up prices - or as a supply shock - insufficient supply, which also pushes up prices. 

  The trick of course is to work out which it is. Demand shocks are relatively easy for central banks to deal with; they can simply raise interest rates to curb demand. 

  But supply shocks are a completely different matter. In the face of an adverse supply shock a central bank will be torn between the negative impact on demand and the positive impact on inflation. 

  Indeed, that largely sums up the message from the Fed and the ECB this week. They each recognized both sides of the dilemma. And the problem is if they go for the wrong lever or even simply too early, it could all get very unpleasant. 

  The U.K. authorities probably got the first oil shock in 1974 about as wrong as it was possible to. They managed to preside over near 30% inflation and mass unemployment. 

  Lessons have obviously been learned. 

  But it doesn't help when the data we are all relying on change the underlying picture. 

  We use the data from the International Energy Agency, a branch of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to analyze the underlying causes of any change in the price of oil. 

  Until recently we had concluded that an increase in demand, largely from China and India, was the overwhelming force driving up oil prices. 

  Negative supply shocks had contributed to the rise, most notably after Hurricane Katrina, but they accounted for less than a fifth of the rise since 2002, by our calculation. 

  But then the data on real oil consumption were revised, on the back of U.S. GDP revisions and higher Chinese demand. 

  There was also a significant downward revision to oil supply. Rather than being a positive force as the IEA had originally expected it to be, oil production slowed during 2007. 

  OPEC quotas played a role, but the bigger miscalculation was the failure to materialize of an expected surge in sub-Saharan African supply. 

  There were also revisions to the previous year's data, leaving the overall picture significantly changed. 

  Adverse supply shocks appear to now account for around half of the rise in crude oil prices since 2005. 

  If true, that will only complicate the issue for central banks around the world. 

  The danger is that the rise in real prices might combine with the ongoing credit squeeze to produce a toxic cocktail. 

  The hope is that central banks have learned the lessons of the 1970s. 

  As long as inflation expectations stay well anchored, there is a very good chance that this time will be different.

296,"Barron&apos;s(11/19) D.C. Current: Big Ben&apos;s Dumb Idea For Fannie And Freddie

   (From BARRON'S) 
   By Jim McTague 

  Being the Federal Reserve bank chairman may make you feel like a know-it-all, but it doesn't actually make you one. 

  Ben Bernanke demonstrated the truth of this axiom on Capitol Hill recently when he suggested that secondary mortgage-market giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac temporarily be granted the authority to buy jumbo home-mortgages of up to $1 million -- more than double the companies' current limit on loan sizes. Though Bernanke said this would help the beleaguered housing sector, James Lockhart, the man who regulates Fannie and Freddie, was totally surprised by the suggestion and told us it would do more harm than good. 

  ""We're talking to the Fed about this,"" says Lockhart, who is director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, an agency that is supposed to prevent Freddie and Fannie from doing anything unsafe and unsound. ""Given the moment,"" Lockhart points out wisely, ""Fannie and Freddie have enough to do in their own space -- the conforming-loan area. They don't have any particular expertise with jumbos. They don't buy them, they don't have systems, models or risk-management tools for them. It would take a lot of implementation."" 

  The two congressionally chartered companies buy mortgages from banks and mortgage companies, which, in turn, use the proceeds to make even more loans, providing liquidity to the marketplace. The size limit on loans eligible for sale to Fannie and Freddie, currently $417,000, is revised annually to reflect changes in an index of housing prices. 

  Right now, thousands of struggling homeowners in expensive markets like California and parts of Florida are burdened with adjustable-rate jumbo loans -- mortgages larger than the Fannie-Freddie limit -- with introductory ""teaser"" rates that will reset to much higher levels this year and next. Those homeowners would like to convert to more manageable fixed-rate loans. But Wall Street, pension funds and other buyers of jumbos have all but stopped their purchases, lest they get caught holding the bag if conditions worsen. 

  For this reason, Bernanke also suggested that the U.S. Treasury explicitly guarantee the repayment of such jumbos if purchased by Freddie and Fannie. (Markets already treat the two mortgage titans as if their actions carry ""implicit"" guarantees, despite annual denials from Treasury.) 

  We asked the White House and Treasury what they thought of Ben's brainstorm and, not surprisingly, were put off with ""No comment."" 

  Lockhart wasn't so bashful. This reliable Bush school- chum was placed at the helm of OFHEO in 2006 to make sure that Fannie and Freddie fulfilled the terms of consent agreements signed earlier when they were caught cooking their books to make earnings appear more robust than in reality. The firms promised to strengthen accounting and management systems, to begin reporting their financial results to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to limit growth and maintain capital levels 30% higher than required by law -- until they got their houses in order. 

  Those restrictions, says Lockhart, prevented the current mortgage crisis from being even larger, by keeping Fannie and Freddie in good shape to buy loans. But he might have to lift the capital and portfolio-growth restrictions sometime after February 2008, if the two giants meet the terms of their earlier agreements and are operating safely. He certainly wouldn't want to do that now: ""It would be a major mistake to lower capital requirements in this market -- almost like repeating the mistakes of the S&L days."" 

  Lockhart has limited powers as a regulator -- he is a lion tamer with neither chair nor lash. His agency was able to impose consent agreements on the two corporations three years ago because they were weakened politically at the time. Fannie and Freddie have since regained influence on the Hill. Lockhart has been urging the Senate to enact legislation, already passed in the House, that would create a new regulatory agency with more teeth. Otherwise, Freddie and Fannie, which already are leveraged about 50 to 1, would be allowed to leverage themselves even higher. Banks have far more rigorous capital standards. 

  Fannie Mae is closer to complying with the consent agreements than is Freddie Mac, because the latter has proved slower at rebuilding itself. When Richard Syron replaced Leland Brendsel as CEO at Freddie Mac, he brought a new management team with him -- one that didn't know the company. ""There was a learning period,"" says Lockhart, ""and Syron made some unfortunate choices. He lost a CFO and a COO, which has made it tough; and he still has a thin management team."" 

  Even with the growth restriction, Freddie and Fannie have been buying more than 60% of the nation's new mortgages, up from 40% last year. That could put them at greater risk in a recession, possibly even requiring a federal bailout. That, says Lockhart, is the ultimate reason why a more powerful regulatory office is needed. ""Congress,"" he says, ""really does have to act."" We couldn't agree more.

297,"German Buba Projects Sticky Inflation, Slowing Econ Growth

 

  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--German economic growth is likely to significantly slow next year, while inflation should remain sticky due to rising energy and food prices, the German central bank's December bulletin showed Monday. 

  Gross domestic product will expand 1.6% in 2008, in real and calendar-adjusted terms, and grow 2.0% in 2009, the Bundesbank said. For the first time ever the Bundesbank has published official macroeconomic estimates for Europe's largest economy. 

  By comparison, German GDP rose by a real, calendar-adjusted 3.1% in 2006 and private-sector analysts' expect it to expand 2.5% this year. 

  In unadjusted terms, the German economy will expand 1.9% in 2008 and 1.9% in 2009, the Bundesbank said. That's marginally below the German government's 2008 growth forecast of about 2.0%. 

  The inflation rate should also remain elevated next year due to rising oil prices, and higher prices for other energy products, raw materials and food, the Bundesbank said. 

  The Bundesbank expects inflation to average 2.3% in 2008, when using the European Union harmonized measure, before moderating to around 1.5% in 2009. 

  The HICP rate is calculated on items in a standardized basket of goods. 

  But, risks to economic activity and inflation have increased since this summer, the Bundesbank warned. 

  The monthly bulletin can be viewed on the Bundesbank's Web site:

   (Adds further comment from Filar.) 
 
   WARSAW (Dow Jones)--Poland's core inflation still remains under control, but a risk of inflation accelerating is serious, Dariusz Filar, a member of the central bank's Monetary Policy Council, or RPP, said Thursday. 

  Speaking in a live TVN CNBC interview, Filar added that the recent rise in inflation was mainly caused by food and fuel prices, ""while core inflation remains close to 1.4%-1.5%."" 

  However, Filar said that he, personally, sees a need for further policy tightening. 

  ""There are two scenarios possible,"" said Filar. ""That core inflation remains stable and food prices start to fall, or that core inflation starts to rise and food prices remain high."" 

  Filar, asked to comment on economists' forecasts that Poland faces 100 basis points of rate hikes throughout 2008, answered that ""such forecasts are justified."" 

  But the actual decisions and the scope of possible rate hikes would depend on economic data, Filar added. 

  He reiterated that the RPP should do all it could to lower inflation to its target of 2.5%. 

  Wednesday, the RPP decided not to follow up the 25-basis-point rate increase in November with another hike, despite above-target CPI and robust wage growth.

299,"Australian 2007-08 Budget Will Beat Tsy Forecast - Access

 

  CANBERRA (Dow Jones)--The Australian government will likely bank a bigger than expected budget surplus in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, buoyed by demand for the country's natural resources, particularly from China, independent forecaster Access Economics predicted Monday. 

  But the newly elected Labor government will need to cut public spending to take the pressure off domestic inflation and prevent the surplus from dropping below 1% of gross domestic product as commodity prices recede, it said. 

  In a budget monitor report, Access said it expected the government to deliver an underlying budget surplus in 2007-08 of A$15.5 billion, A$1.1 billion higher than a Treasury estimate issued ahead of the Nov. 24 federal election. 

  The usually conservative Treasury department, in a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook in October, forecast a 2007-08 budget surplus of A$14.4 billion, down from A$17.2 billion in 2006-07. 

  Access Economics' forecast is A$700,000 above a forecast surplus of A$14.8 billion made in a midyear economic and fiscal outlook released by Treasury officials at the start of the six-week election campaign. 

  Booming commodity prices have boosted tax revenues for the past five and a half years, allowing the government to deliver surpluses that beat Treasury forecasts. 

  But Access Economics warned that center-left Labor - which won the election in a landslide victory over the 11-year-old Liberal-National coalition government - needs to cut back on spending to avoid creating further inflationary headaches for the country's central bank. 

  Access Economics director Chris Richardson said that the previous administration, by redistributing larger-than-expected surpluses through tax cuts, turned off the ""automatic stabilizers"" that traditionally saw the budget improve in an economic upswing and worsen in a downswing. 

  ""That meant the burden of macro management fell solely to the Reserve Bank of Australia,"" Richardson said. ""The end result of that process means, under current circumstances, a simple equation applies: tax cuts equal interest rate rises."" 

  Labor is promising income tax cuts that will cost A$31 billion over the next three years. But it also plans to take a ""razor gang"" approach to public spending, cutting back on some programs introduced by the previous government. 

  ""If it succeeds in trimming waste and improves value in doing so, that will come with the considerable additional benefit of taking pressure off interest rates,"" Richardson said. 

  Access Economics also cautioned that with growth in both demand and profits tipped to slow, the government will need to cut back on spending in coming years to make sure it meets its target of keeping the budget in surplus on average over the economic cycle. 

  ""Unless policies change, the surplus will drop back to 0.6% of gross domestic product by 2010-11, and it is seen heading further south thereafter,"" Richardson said. 

  Access Economics is forecasting a surplus of A$15 billion in 2008-09, A$13.6 billion in 2009-10, and A$8.2 billion in 2010-11. 

  That compares with Treasury's midyear forecast for budget surpluses of A$14.4 billion in 2008-09, A$17.7 billion in 2009-10, and A$15.1 billion in 2010-11.

300,"UPDATE: PBOC Imposes Special Deposit Requirement - Sources

 
   (Adds analysts' comments, background on special deposits) 
 

  SHANGHAI (Dow Jones)--China's central bank has told  selected city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives they must place special deposits with it on Dec. 27, the second time this year it has adopted this unconventional approach to drain liquidity, two people familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday. 

  The decision indicates Beijing's mounting concerns over the excess liquidity in its financial system caused by a ballooning trade surplus. It also came after the remarks by People's Bank of China Vice Gov. Wu Xiaoling over the weekend that China needs to further curb money-supply and credit growth because ""monetary factors"" do add to inflation pressures. 

  Despite the PBOC's instruction, the banks and cooperatives participating in the program can decide how much they are each willing to place as special deposits, said the two people, who declined to be named. 

  The central bank will offer an interest rate of 3.37% on three-month deposits and 3.99% on one-year deposits, they added. The two rates are the same as the yields on the three-month and one-year bills the PBOC sold in its regular open market operation last week. 

  An official at the PBOC's news department declined to comment. 

  The PBOC last told an unspecified group of city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives to submit special deposits Oct. 17, the first time since 2000 it used this method to withdraw liquidity. 

  ""The special deposit has gradually become a routine tightening tool by the central bank to strengthen its credit control in smaller financial institutions. It also reflects the pressure the central bank's facing to curb rising inflation,"" said Shanghai Securities analyst Wang Yingfeng. 

  Despite the central bank's five interest rate hikes and nine reserve requirement ratio increases in the first 11 months of this year, China's consumer price index accelerated to an 11-year high of 6.9% in November. The PBOC said Dec. 8 it will increase banks' reserve requirement ratio for the 10th time this year by 100 basis points, twice as much as previous increases this year. 

  Compared with the upcoming 100 basis-point ratio hike, which is expected to take about CNY350 billion out of circulation, the total amount drained by the special deposits is unlikely to be huge, given the small asset base of city commercial banks and credit cooperatives, analysts said. 

  A Shanghai-based fund manager said he expects the special deposits to lock up around CNY10 billion in funds. 

  ""But if the PBOC fails to slow down the growth in money supply and inflation in the coming months, it could order the smaller lenders to deposit more funds next time,"" said the fund manager, who declined to be named.

U.S. SUMMARY & ASIAN OUTLOOK: 

  STOCKS: 

  U.S. stocks fell sharply after the Federal Reserve reacted less drastically to the ""credit crunch"" than many traders had hoped, cutting the federal funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5% and the discount rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%. 

  After several hints of cuts from Fed members and the government's trumpeted concerns about conditions in mortgage markets, some traders had anticipated a more decisive move from the central bank. When that didn't come, optimism on financials was flushed out of the market, and momentum changed, said Pete McCorry, senior equity trader at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. 

  ""It pushes off a sense of recovery"" from financial woes, McCorry said. 

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 294.26, or 2.1%, to 13432.77, its biggest drop in nearly five weeks. The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 66.60, or 2.4%, to 2652.35. 

  Among individual stocks, General Electric lost 1% to 37.03. The industrial and financial conglomerate projected 2008 per-share earnings below analysts' expectations, reflecting ""a slowing U.S. economy."" 

  Washington Mutual dropped 12% to 17.42. The largest U.S. savings and loan plans to slash its dividend by 73%, raise $2.5 billion in fresh capital and cut more than 3,000 jobs to address ""unprecedented challenges in the mortgage and credit markets."" 

  While WaMu had its own issues, banks were decimated in the aftermath of the Fed's action, as declines were marked by all 80 members of the S&P 500's financial sector. 

  Dow industrial AT&T rose 4.1% to 39.46. The telecommunications giant announced a 12.7% increase in its quarterly dividend, the biggest boost on an annual basis in its history; a new 400 million-share repurchase plan; and financial forecasts for the next few years that topped expectations. 

  Crude oil futures rose above $90 a barrel in New York as ice storms stopped flow through key U.S. oil pipelines and after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. 

  The base metals ended the London Metal Exchange trading session in recent ranges ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Gold futures moved mildly higher in New York as trading was subdued ahead of the announcement. 

  FOREX: 

  The yen bested the euro and dollar in New York after financial markets befell a spell of risk aversion when the Federal Open Market Committee announced a third consecutive cut to interest rates to defend the U.S. economy against recession. 

  The yen surged on a sharp decline in U.S. stocks, which were disappointed by the mere 25-basis point cut to the fed funds rate, instead of a 50-basis point reduction - although few market watchers actually expected the latter. 

  ""This is the bare minimum that was expected,"" said Marc Chandler, global head of foreign exchange at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. 

  Consequently, the euro dropped almost three yen from its intraday high and the dollar declined almost one-and-a-half yen from its intraday high after the announcement. The euro's significant fall, just one day after striking a one-month high of Y164.58, helped boost the dollar against the single currency. 

  The dollar was also boosted against the euro, said Robert Sinche, head of global foreign exchange at Bank of America in New York, because it is more attractive than it would have been if there was a 50-basis point cut. 

  A cut to the fed funds rate of any size suggests downside risks for the U.S. currency because lower rates reduce investors' returns on dollar-denominated assets. 

  However, the dollar's reaction wasn't as large as seen in the past, perhaps because the Fed itself stressed the current uncertainty. ""For now, the foreign exchange markets will be taking their cue from other markets, like the commodity and equity markets,"" Sinche added. 

  Tuesday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.4651 from $1.4713 late Monday, while the dollar was at Y110.67 from Y111.64. The euro was at Y162.14 from Y164.25, according to EBS. The U.K. pound was at $2.0334 from $2.0470, while the dollar was quoted at CHF1.1312 from CHF1.1283 late Monday. 

  The Federal Open Market Committee voted 9-1 to reduce the federal funds rate to 4.25% from 4.5%, its third-straight reduction since September totaling 100 basis points. It also cut the discount rate it charges banks that borrow directly from the Fed by 25 basis points to 4.75%. 

  The market anticipated a cut after statements from several officials early last month, most pointedly by Fed Governor Randall Kroszner, who said on Nov. 16 that ""the current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year."" 

  The dollar had retreated from its lifetime lows against the euro following that speech on the positive momentum it created in U.S. equities. 

  ""Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing,"" the FOMC said in its statement, reflecting the ""intensification"" of the housing slump and slower business and consumer spending. 

  The statement signaled an about-face from the previous Fed meeting, when the board suggested further easing was off the table. The Fed also dropped its previous assertion that growth and inflation risks were roughly balanced, opting instead for an open-ended view, and pledged to ""act as needed"" to keep the economy growing and inflation in check. 

  The buck and euro's subsequent decline versus the yen followed a typical low-risk appetite trading pattern. The yen benefits during times of risk aversion because Japan's ultra-low interest rates make the yen a funding currency for riskier assets when the market has a more positive sentiment. When that perspective shifts, the funds shift back into the yen. A similar pattern often aids the dollar against the euro and currencies like the Brazilian real, as it did Tuesday. 

  However, currency analysts say that the Fed's downside view of the economy indicates that this is no dollar rebound. 

  BONDS: 

  U.S. Treasury prices soared after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its target rate by 25 basis points, as investors interpreted the move as insufficient to help considerably ease conditions in strained credit markets. 

  While investors had widely expected the quarter point cut to the fed funds rate, many had anticipated a heftier ease in the discount window rate to loosen up strained money markets, where interbank lending rates have remained stubbornly high. When that didn't materialize, investors grew more convinced that financial market conditions will worsen, a reaction that sent Treasury yields lower as stocks fell. Bond prices move inversely to yields. 

  With shorter-term Treasurys gaining the most, the yield curve also steepened. In late trade, the two-year note was up 14/32 at 2.92% and the 10-year note was up 1 14/32 at 3.97%, leaving Treasurys benchmark yield curve, the spread between the two- and 10-year note yields, at plus 105 basis points.   Just before the announcement, the two-year Treasury note was yielding 3.13% and the 10-year note was yielding 4.10%. 

  Treasury bills were also boosted by the news as investors sought out the safest possible assets, with the three-month T-bill bond equivalent yield down 14 basis points at 2.91% and the six month T-bill bond equivalent yield down 13 basis points at 3.18%. 

  ""The expectation in the market was that they needed to move the discount rate below the funds rate,"" said Tom di Galoma, head of Treasurys at Jefferies & Co. in New York. 

  The fact that policymakers chose not to make a more dramatic move was surely ""a big disappointment for the credit markets,"" said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn., with the move ""undoubtedly bullish for Treasurys relative to just about everything else."" Ader said he has his eye on the 2.80% level for the two-year note as a possibly attractive selling spot. 

  In its meeting statement, the Fed also dropped the assertion from its previous statement that the risks to growth and to inflation were roughly equal. The Fed pledged to ""act as needed"" to keep the economy growing and control inflation. 

  The day's decision further boosted shorter-term Treasurys, the most sensitive to the Fed's decisions, which have been gaining recently on renewed signs that banks are wary to lend to each other given concerns about their exposure to shaky subprime and structured finance investments. Cash-hoarding ahead of year-end has also kept money market rates high. 

  With the Fed and markets not seeing eye to eye on the outlook for money markets and the impact of the credit crunch on the economy, interest rate futures remain priced for further rate cuts in 2008, with Treasurys likely to remain in favor. 

  ""The Fed and the market are just not on the same page,"" said Richard Gilhooly, senior fixed income strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.

302,"Jersey Electricity 13-Week Revenue In Energy Business Up 28%

 

  Edited Press Release 

 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Jersey Electricity Company Limited said Thursday that in the thirteen weeks from the beginning of the financial year to the end of December, unit sales of electricity in its Energy business rose by 8% due mainly to unseasonably mild weather in the same period last year. 

  Revenues in the Energy business are 28% higher than the same period last year due to this increase in sales volumes combined with a tariff rise which took place on 1 January 2007 to cover an increase in its cost base from escalating wholesale electricity prices. 

  The company said: ""A similar trending of unit sales and revenues continued during the month of January 2008. We have pledged not to increase tariffs further until at least Jan. 1, 2009. 

  ""Our power purchase and foreign exchange requirements are materially hedged for the remainder of this financial year mitigating recent further increases in wholesale electricity prices (on which our European power importation contract is based) and the substantial weakening of sterling against the euro. 

  ""Our other business units, at a total level, are trading ahead of the corresponding financial position in the last financial year. 

  ""The GBP13 million project to upgrade the electricity infrastructure in the west of Jersey, which was initiated during the last financial year, continued on schedule during the period since the last financial year end. It is still expected to be completed in October 2008. 

  ""Our balance sheet remains strong and there have been no significant changes in the financial position of the Company since the issue of our Preliminary Announcement in mid-December 2007 for the year ended Sep. 30, 2007."" 

  The cash balance at the end of December 2007 was GBP15 million compared to GBP16 million at the last financial year end.

303,"Istanbul Dec CPI +0.95% on Mo Vs +1.94% In Nov - IHS

 

  DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  Consumer prices in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, increased 0.95% on the month in December, slowing from a 1.94% increase in November, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, or ITO, said Tuesday, the Ihlas News Agency reported. 

  On the year, however, inflation in Istanbul decreased to 12.46% in December from 12.64% in November, the ITO said. 

  Although the ITO calculates its data in a different way from the official Turkish Statistics Institute, or TUIK, the chamber's data are viewed as a good indicator of the national trend, as Istanbul is considered the country's financial capital, IHS reported. 

  TUIK is due to publish December national inflation data on Thursday. 

  In the most recent central bank survey on Dec. 24, expectations for average year-end national inflation were slightly lower, at 8.64%, compared with 8.66% in the preceding survey conducted Dec. 7. 

  IHS reported that monthly inflation expectations for December were also at 0.58% in the survey, unchanged from the previous forecast made Dec. 7. 

  At the beginning of the year, the Turkish central bank set the annual inflation target at 4%. Annual inflation stood at 9.65% in 2006, and many analysts have said the 2007 target is too ambitious.

304,"UPDATE:NY Regulator:Key To Resolve Bond Insurers Problems Quickly

 

  (Updates with Fitch downgrades, share prices, spokespeople's comments; adds context) 

 
   By Romy Varghese 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Regulators Thursday acknowledged that it will take time to deal with problems that embattled bond insurers are facing just as a second company lost its coveted triple-A ranking. 

  ""Clearly, it is important to resolve issues related to the bond insurers as soon as possible,"" New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo said in a written statement. 

  The press release came shortly after Fitch Ratings downgraded XL Capital Assurance five notches to A, and the holding company, Security Capital Assurance (SCA), was slashed from triple-A to triple-B, near the bottom of the investment-grade ladder. 

  Fitch's decision and Dinallo's statement suggest investors may have gotten ahead of themselves Wednesday when they heard about Dinallo's attempts to harness banks' capital to save the bond insurers, whose tenuous hold on their top ratings have spread concern throughout financial markets. 

  Stocks of bond insurers were down Thursday, a day after Ambac Financial Group (ABK), which was cut to double-A by Fitch Ratings and is on watch by the other two ratings agencies, saw its shares soar 72%. They're now down by 6%. MBIA Inc. (MBI), which saw its shares gain 33% Wednesday, has fallen by 8%. SCA has plummeted 17%. 

  Dinallo may have tempered hopes of an imminent deal, as he said that there are ""complicated issues"" with many parties involved. ""Any effective plan will take some time to finalize,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we will not respond to the inevitable rumors."" 

  The New York Times reported that Dinallo told a group of Wall Street executives Wednesday that it should move in 48 hours to set up a deal on the bond insurers. 

  But a banker involved in the discussions called them ""very preliminary,"" according to The Wall Street Journal. 

  Complex securities guaranteed by the bond insurers, such as subprime mortgage-backed deals, have plummeted in value amid the credit market turmoil. The insurers guarantee about $2.4 trillion in outstanding debt, and the loss of their top-notch ratings means a repricing of insured debt and a chilling effect on the industry. 

  Also, it could trigger further downgrades at banks and brokers, who already are reeling from subprime losses and are searching for additional capital themselves. Wall Street firms had bought protection from the insurers as a way to reduce their capital needs, but is now facing the possibility of having to put the losses on their own balance sheets. 

  An MBIA spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday on the bailout discussions, and Ambac didn't return a call for comment. The insurers weren't present at the meeting between Dinallo and bank executives, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

  Credit default swaps, which are contracts allowing investors to wager on firms' creditworthiness, tightened significantly Wednesday for MBIA and Ambac on bailout hopes but widened somewhat Thursday morning. They were unchanged after the Fitch and Dinallo releases, at 455 basis points for MBIA and 460 basis points for Ambac. That means the annual cost of protecting a notional $10 million of MBIA bonds against default for five years is $455,000 and for Ambac bonds, $460,000.

========================================================== 

  BUDAPEST (Dow Jones)--Hungary's headline consumer price inflation accelerated in December, exceeding analyst expectations, as food and energy prices remained at an elevated level, the Central Statistics Office, or KSH said Tuesday. 

  Headline consumer prices rose 0.4% on the month and were up 7.4% from a year earlier in December, rising considerably faster than the median forecast of 15 analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires, who had predicted a rise of 7.2%. Forecasts had come in a relatively narrow range of 7.2% and 7.5%. 

  ""I can't say new things - it's evidently food and energy prices again, cooking oil, milk, dairy products and eggs...the rise in the other categories was negligible,"" a KSH statistician told Dow Jones Newswires at the time of the release. 

  Food prices rose 0.8% and car fuel prices increased 2.0% on the month, slowing somewhat from monthly rises of 1.4% and 3.3% respectively in November. The slower increase was expected by analysts. The price of cooking oil jumped 9.2% on the month while cheese rose 2.8% and eggs rose 1.7% in the same period. 

  Although food and energy prices boosted headline inflation, services prices, which are also closely watched by analysts, rose only 0.1%. Consumer durables prices fell 0.1% and clothing prices were unchanged on the month in December. 

  Core inflation, excluding volatile energy and food prices, also picked up in December. 

  ""Unprocessed food prices such as (the price of) eggs are excluded from the core reading but processed food prices are not,"" Minary added. She cited milk as a booster for core prices as well as for the headline reading, as milk prices rose 2.4% on the month. 

  Minary declined to be specific on the outlook for inflation. She noted, however, that price hikes reported in the local press by local governments of certain services prices such as public transport, utilities, and other centrally mandated price rises as postal services will boost January inflation, as most probably will a full liberalization of the power market. 

  Inflation was 8.0% on average in 2007, up sharply from 3.9% in 2006, but in line with analysts' forecasts in a poll carried out by Dow Jones Newswires.

307,"Irvine Energy: 1st Hydrocarbon Sales, Niobrara To Commence

 

  Edited Press Release 

 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Irvine Energy, a AIM-listed oil and gas exploration and production company, said Tuesday that production has commenced within its 162,000 acre portfolio of onshore oil and gas projects in the USA. 

 

  Highlights 

  * Irvine Net Production from Jan 9 to Jan 31 was 6.973 million standard cubic feet of gas and 76 BBLS of oil, from 18 wells in Oklahoma, marking Irvine's first hydrocarbon sales. Production due to commence at Niobrara from 20 wells following completion of workover programmes 
 * Four wells completed in Oklahoma and workover programmes initiated on a further three wells 
 * Initial well locations identified in Kansas targeting the Arbuckle and Mississippian formation in the highly prospective Cooley oil fields 
 * 3D seismic programmes at Ares and Udall project areas in Kansas underway to identify multiple drill targets 
 * Current 2008 drill programme includes 30+ wells to raise reserve base and increase oil and gas production across portfolio 
 * Production phase now reached leading to cash flow - 18 producing wells, three shut in and four being completed with intention to raise the number across the portfolio to 45 by mid 2008 

  The Compay's Managing Director, Aaron Close, said: ""This is a transformational period for the Company as we develop our prospective oil and gas targets in the U.S. and enter the production phase. 

  ""With an extensive portfolio already in place, we will now rapidly increase our reserve base through exploration and our cash flow through a ramp-up in production as more wells come on stream. 

  ""Our strategy of focussing on shallow, low-cost drilling projects in areas of stacked pay zones and existing infrastructure is proving itself across our portfolio. At our current rate of development, we aim to be producing in our three areas of operation by April."" 

  Attributable production in Oklahoma began on Jan. 9 following the completion of the final closing agreements between Metro Energy Group and Irvine. 

  Irvine produced 7.973 million standard cubic feet of natural gas and 76 bbls of oil net to its interest during the month of Jan. 

   Workover work is under way on three existing wells that did not report production during Jan. 

  Drilling of the Patriot 3-15, the Priegle 2-10 and Summers 1-3 operated by Metro, as well as the Ross 3-27 operated by Williams Energy, has been completed. Additional drilling and workover programmes are underway and will be announced as results become available. 

  In Kansas, the first of the 3D seismic shoots has been interpreted and the initial well location has been selected. Drilling is planned to begin at the end of Feb. and is expected to take two to three weeks. 

  If successful, the completion processes are expected to take a further three weeks. The well will be targeting primarily oil pay in the Arbuckle formation as an extension of the highly productive Cooley oil field. 

  The Ares and Udall project areas 3D seismic programmes are in progress and the Ares 3D is underway and expected to finish by March. The seismic crew will move directly to the Udall area and begin shooting there upon completion of the Ares. 

  Once completed, processing is expected to take 30 days and interpretation will take an additional 30 days. This is being conducted to identify multiple drill targets in accordance with the Company's development plan. 

  Following an evaluation programme of the Niobrara Project in Kansas during the second half of 2007, 20 initial wells were selected for development. All of these now have pumping units and gas gathering lines in place. 

  The water disposal permit has been approved and the water disposal well is being prepared for use. The gas sales contracts are in place and a gas compressor is being prepared. 

  Production is targeted at 500 mcf/ d net to Irvine, with current prices in the region of $7.00/mcf. First gas sales are expected in March. 

  Development of the extensive inventory of undrilled well locations in this project is expected to begin in Q2, after production from the initial 20 wells has stabilised and production rates are confirmed to be in line with Irvine's expectations.

308,"FOCUS: German Unions Prepping Strikes As Talks Drag On

   By Roman Kessler   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)--Ignoring pleas for wage restraint, Germany's two largest unions are lining up more warning strikes to back some of the biggest wage demands in the euro zone. 

  Nearly 2,000 Eastern German steel workers from the big IG Metall union Tuesday staged warning strikes for an 8% pay raise at two steel plants, including the Arcelor Mittal GmbH plant at Eisenhuettenstadt, a unit of the ArcelorMittal group (MT). 

  IG Metall, with 2.3 million members, seeks an 8% pay rise for more than 100,000 steel workers and says it's ready to do more for its other members in the months ahead, including auto workers and electrical workers. 

  The Ver.di services union, also demanding an 8% pay hike, Tuesday resumed talks with government representatives threatening to stage warning strikes later in the week. Federal and local governments are standing by their offer of 5% in three steps over two years. 

  The warning strikes are precursors to possible open-ended labor actions if truce periods end without a deal. The IG Metal negotiations are set to end on Feb. 19. The public-sector talks are set to run until March 7, but the unions can break off talks any time and call an open-ended walkout. 

  German auto makers Daimler AG (DAI.XE), Porsche AG (POR3.XE) and Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE), BMW AG (BMW.XE) among others will have to come back to the negotiating table with IG Metall before their current wage contracts expire Sept. 30. 

  Unions are showing new resolve after years of being weakened by defections and job losses to globalization, the rank-and-file are demanding their piece of a bumper earnings year after years of wage restraint. 

  Another reason is the toll rising inflation is taking on households. The European Central Bank has warned against demanding more pay to compensate, rising a wage-price spiral that will spin a currently 3.2% inflation still higher. But unions are digging in for a fight. 

  For public sector workers, the offer of a 5% raise over two years isn't deemed to be nearly enough. 

  ""This offer is a joke,"" a 55-year old garbage collector in Frankfurt said while pushing trash cans to the lorry. He has a family and said higher taxes, rising health insurance contributions and rent are exhausting his earnings before the end of the month. 

  ""We're ready to go on strike. Three weeks, if necessary. Imagine how this city would look like if we stop taking out its trash. It would be catastrophic."" His colleagues nod. 

  Ver.di union is focusing on inflation in one of the most important wage rounds this year that affect 2.2 million public-sector employees, including private health care and social institutions.   ""We're already thinking of strike strategies that really hurt the employers,"" said Werner Romuender, a labor representative for 320 road sweepers and garbage collectors in the City of Kassel, central Germany. ""Think of striking ticket controllers in public transport: when we announce they'll walk out, why should people get a ticket?"" 

  German unions were emboldened by the small GDL train drain drivers union, which after a series of open-ended strikes late last year wrested an 11% pay hike out of the Deutsche Bahn AG national railway. 

  ""Our people saw that, of course,"" Romuender said. ""They have a feeling that its time for significantly higher pay."" 

  Many workers left the German unions since the 1990s and Germany had the fewest strikes per hour worked by euro zone standards in recent years. Bargaining power also declined as employers threatened to move abroad. 

  ""The atmosphere is generally heated - not only in the steel sector. In many sectors Germans want to participate in the economic success,"" the chairman of the association of steel-sector employers AGV Helmut F. Koch said. ""And we can't say that our sector is ailing."" 

  But the wage demands come amid signs that, after a year of growth, the German economic recovery is losing steam with the rest of the euro zone. 

  The European Central Bank has warned that Europe will be affected by the slowdown in the U.S. The German government now expects the export-driven economy to slow to a 1.7% growth rate in 2008 from 2.5% in 2007. 

  There are also little signs that consumption could pick up as data show that consumers are unwilling to loosen their purse strings. Rather than adopt the ECB's caution against inflation, the unions take the tack that higher wages could help stimulate domestic demand. 

  ""There are signs that the economic growth is retreating in 2008. That's exactly why it is of the essence to strengthen domestic private consumption with higher wages,"" ver.di's chief economist Michael Schlecht said.

309,"3rd UPDATE: ECB Bini Smaghi:Downside GDP Risk,Upside CPI Risk

 

  (Adds further quote on market turmoil.) 

 

  FLORENCE, Italy (Dow Jones)--Downside risks to growth and upside risks to the inflation rate prevail in the euro zone, senior European Central Bank official Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said Wednesday. 

  The next ECB staff projections, due to be released March 6, will contain ""novelties,"" Bini Smaghi said on the sidelines of a conference. The new projections will reflect greater possibilities that growth will slow more than expected, while price trends move higher than anticipated, he said. 

  ""Some news is positive, some news is negative,"" he said about recent economic data from the euro zone. Germany's Ifo business sentiment index unexpectedly rose in February, while other indicators have been weakening. 

  Bini Smaghi also said the ECB's ""baseline scenario"" is that the U.S. economy won't enter a recession. ""The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound,"" he said. 

  ""The American economy is being influenced by the financial market turmoil, which in Europe seems to be more limited,"" he added. 

  However, a slower U.S. economy will inevitably have an impact on the euro zone, he said. The two large economies may be somewhat diverging, but they are in the same cycle, he said. 

  The rising oil and raw materials prices are a ""big worry, because they reflect the scarcity of resources,"" he said. 

  ""We have to avoid letting these hikes trigger inflationary forces,"" he added. ""We must limit the effects of (raw material prices) on wages."" 

  The ECB has left interest rates unchanged since credit markets ground to a halt last summer, while offering large-scale liquidity injections into the banking system. 

  The market turmoil ""will take some time to be digested,"" Bini Smaghi said. 

  The main problem, he added, is that ""banks don't trust each other."" 

  ""Confidence in the financial system's ability to assess some financial instruments has crumbled,"" the central banker said. 

  That has stymied the interbank lending market, which in turn has pushed up short-term money market rates. Banks are concerned that counterparty collateral may be exposed to U.S. subprime mortgages and other weakening credits. 

  ""It's probably a more complex process than in the past,"" Bini Smaghi said, referring to the current credit market turmoil compared with the Asian crisis of the late 1990s or the crash in technology stocks that began in 2000.

311,"UPDATE: Australian Wages Data Affirm Case For RBA Hikes

 

  By Sam Holmes 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australian wages growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2007, in line with expectations, likely adding to the Reserve Bank of Australia's concerns that cost pressures from the tight labor market are now feeding into the broader inflationary landscape. 

  The figures have added to the already strong case for a quarter of a percentage point interest rate hike in March and build on arguments for a followup move in May. 

  It also shows that inflationary pressures in Australia, driven by strong domestic demand, high commodities prices and capacity constraints, are broadening as the RBA has recently warned. 

  Australian wages excluding bonuses rose 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the third quarter and rose 4.2% from a year earlier, Australian Bureau of Statistics labor price data issued Wednesday show. 

  In the private sector, wages excluding bonuses rose 1.1% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and rose 4.3% from a year earlier. Public-sector wages rose 1.0% in the quarter and increased 4.1% from a year earlier. 

  Wages including bonuses rose 1.1% in the quarter and rose 4.5% on the year. 

  ICAP chief economist Matthew Johnson says while the figures were as-expected, it still pointed to the RBA remained poised for a round of near-term tightening. 

  ""That trend in the private sector data is a little bit worrying and that would reflect what the RBA is saying about these sorts of wage pressures out there,"" Johnson said. 

  ""There is nothing in this data to suggest that the RBA was wrong to be worried about wages...however, there is nothing in the data that really sounds the alarm bells."" 

  In the last week-and-a-half, the central bank has delivered several warnings the wage increases were beginning to spill over into price chains. 

  On Tuesday, RBA assistant governor Malcolm Edey said there had been some very recent evidence of higher wages growth. 

  This adds to what the RBA said in its very hawkish quarterly statement on monetary policy released last week, which all but confirmed a March rate hike. 

  The minutes from the RBA's Feb. 5 meeting, when it voted to lift rates a quarter of a percentage point to 7.0%, revealed Tuesday the central bank had even considered a 50 basis point increase this month. 

  TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said   wages growth remained uncomfortably high for the RBA at current levels. 

  ""The RBA still has an inflation headache to deal with,"" he said. 

  ""Broadly speaking, wages appear to be edging higher and for the RBA to soften its hawkish policy stance, the data needed to have a downward surprise. 

  ""On an annualized basis, wages look to be heading from 4.0% to more than 4.5% year-on-year, and the RBA will view that as a threat to inflation."" 

  ANZ senior economist Tony Pearson said the annual rate of growth in private sector wages was the highest reading since the series started in 1998. 

  ""There's still evidence of a gradual swelling of wage pressures,"" he said. 

  ""There hasn't been a wage breakout in the sense of a sharp uptick, but it does indicate a gradual acceleration of private sector wages. 

  ""That's the series we've been focused on from a policy perspective."" 

  However, other data released Wednesday pointed to a moderation in the economy. 

  The Westpac-Melbourne Institute economic leading indicator grew at an annualized rate of 4.7% in December, down from 6.1% in November, suggesting a moderation in the likely pace of economic growth toward long-term trend levels in the next three to nine months. 

  And an index of job vacancies for skilled workers in Australia fell by 2.2% in February from January, and was 6.4% lower from a year ago, the Department of Employment said. 

  The index currently stands at 97.7. 

  Despite the on-consensus wages date, the Australian dollar sold off as traders took back short positions on news the data weren't higher than expected. 

  The Australian dollar fell to US$0.9174 when the figures were published at 0030 GMT, from US$0.9194 earlier. At 0101 GMT, the Australian dollar was US$0.9191. Australian bonds were marginally stronger also on relief buying with both 3-year futures and 10-year futures up half a basis point each at 93.035 and 93.48, respectively.

312,"Petronas Funds Can&apos;t Be Used To Cut Fuel Prices - Govt

 

  KUALA LUMPUR (AP)--Malaysia cannot use funds from Petroliam Nasional Bhd. as a quick fix to lower fuel prices because the state oil company needs resources to expand and compete globally, a finance official was quoted as saying Monday. 

  Malaysia, a net oil exporter, heavily subsidizes retail fuel prices, but it has warned it may have to reduce subsidies this year after global oil prices recently breached US$100 a barrel. 

  Second Finance Minister Nor Mohamed Yakcop was quoted by the New Straits Times as saying that Petronas - as the national oil company is also known - was already financing various government projects and needs funds to expand abroad to ensure it remains competitive and profitable. 

  ""Petronas has to look for new resources, as our natural oil and gas reserves are expected to run out by 2011,"" he said. 

  ""This reinvestment effort comes at a huge cost, and we cannot simply stop Petronas from expanding just for the sake of a quick fix for global petrol price hikes."" 

  He suggested it was better for Petronas - Malaysia's only Fortune 500 company and the country's most profitable firm - to use the money to invest in international markets and boost its capacity for the long term. 

  The government last raised prices of gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas in February 2006, when crude oil futures were near a then record high around US$70 a barrel. 

  The government says it spent MYR43.4 billion (US$13.6 billion) in 2007 to subsidize fuel and other essential items and that Malaysia's fuel prices remained among the lowest in Southeast Asia. 

  The anticipated hike in fuel prices, which will spark an overall rise in the cost of living, is a key challenge for Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's ruling coalition in March 8 general elections. 

  Opposition parties have tapped into public unhappiness, promising to use profits from Petronas to raise fuel subsidies if they win. But the coalition is expected to easily win again, although with fewer seats. 

  Petronas posted a net profit of MYR46.4 billion for the fiscal year ending March 2007. During the year, it paid MYR48.3 billion in taxes, royalties, dividends and export duty, making it the single biggest tax payer in Malaysia.

313,"UPDATE:Rio Tinto Plays Hardball With Mills On Iron Ore Price

 
   By Matt Chambers and Stephen Bell 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  MELBOURNE (Dow Jones)--Pointing to soaring spot iron ore prices, Rio Tinto Ltd. (RTP) continues to play hardball with steel makers and is holding out for a more-than-71% increase in contract prices with Asian mills. 

  London-based Rio Tinto, the world's second-biggest iron ore exporter, is defying convention and refusing to step into line with a price rise of between 66% and 71% agreed to by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) last month. Rio's Australian iron ore mines are much closer to Asia than those of Brazil's Vale, and Rio says steel mills should pay extra because they don't have to ship the material as far. 

  Rio Tinto will ""do what we can to secure an appropriate return for our shareholders,"" iron ore unit chief Sam Walsh said Wednesday at a conference in Perth, referring to Rio Tinto's push for a price rise higher than those secured by Vale. Rio Tinto's ore continues to be sold ""without the premium we believe it merits for being so much cheaper to import than iron ore from elsewhere."" 

  Usually the world's three big iron producers - Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton (BHP) - fall into line once one of them secures a contract with a major steel maker for the Japanese fiscal year. But Rio Tinto is this year defending a takeover bid from BHP and doing all it can to boost its bottom line. BHP, which is yet to settle contracts but hasn't publicly said it is looking for an extra hike, unsuccessfully held out for a freight premium in 2005. 

  Walsh said spot prices are now US$100 a metric ton more than current contract prices and have risen by US$20 a ton since Vale settled. Spot prices in China and India rose as high as US$216/ton March 1, according to Merrill Lynch, still about 50% higher than the new price secured by Vale for Japanese fiscal 2008, which starts April 1. 

  Unusually, Vale's deal this year included two different price categories, with higher quality ore getting a 71% gain. 

 
   No Rush To Settle 
 

  The recent gains in the spot market mean Rio Tinto is prepared to be patient and won't rush to follow Vale's earlier-than-expected settlement. Also, with iron representing a bigger slice of Rio Tinto's bottom line than BHP's, a bigger price hike would work in favor of defending BHP's all-stock bid. 

  ""We are sitting tight, waiting for the market to recognize the fundamentals,"" Walsh said, adding a deal with its steel mill customers isn't imminent. ""I'd remind you that a couple of years ago, it wasn't until June that the price was settled."" 

  Merrill Lynch analysts said they expect Australian iron ore producers to achieve a minimum 71% hike, which is the price rise Vale gained for its better-quality Carajas ore. 

  ""We were surprised the (Vale) settlement was so early, and that the increase was not higher,"" Merrill Lynch said in a research note this week, adding Vale's talks about merging with Xstrata PLC (XTA.LN) may have  influenced the timing. ""A higher price increase would have been supported by the elevated spot prices, supply disruptions, the tight steel markets and strong Chinese demand."" 

  The iron ore miners achieved contract gains of 9.5% in 2007, 19% in 2006 and 71.5% in 2005. In recent years, negotiations have tended to stretch past the April 1 start of the Japanese fiscal year. 

  Walsh said he expects the current system of setting benchmark contract prices to change gradually, but doesn't expect to see miners and mills ""rushing to an LME-based system with futures."" Late last year, BHP said it favors an index pricing system for iron ore sales. 

  Merrill Lynch said a new, third-party managed iron ore index ""appears inevitable"" in two or three years.

  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--Indian government bond prices fell Monday on speculation that a sharp increase in the inflation rate may prompt the central bank to take action to curb rising prices before its scheduled monetary policy review at the end of April, traders said. 

  The benchmark 7.99% 2017-dated bond ended at INR100.30, down from INR100.52 at Friday's close. Its yield rose four basis points to 7.94%. 

  ""Everybody is now expecting the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to act with possibly a cash reserve ratio hike,"" said a foreign bank's bond dealer. 

  Cash reserve ratio, or the share of deposits banks must keep with the RBI, is currently 7.50%. The RBI has hiked the cash reserve ratio 250 basis points since December 2006 to absorb inflation-fueling excess cash from the banking system. 

  The central bank will review its monetary policy April 29. 

  Inflation, measured by wholesale prices, accelerated to over a one-year high of 6.68% in the week ended March 15, data showed Friday. 

  ""If the current trend continues, inflation could well average above 6.5% for FY08/09 versus our current expectations of 5.7%,"" said Standard Chartered Bank's senior economist Shuchita Mehta in a research note. 

  India's financial year runs from April to March. 

  ""Low inflation with financial stability is our aim...the emphasis on price stability will continue,"" RBI Deputy Governor Rakesh Mohan said Friday after market hours. 

  ""I would have to say that inflation in the last two weeks has been higher than our expectation...We have to examine the international and domestic price trends more closely,"" Mohan said. 

  India's Cabinet Committee on Prices, a top ministers' panel led by the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is meeting at 1430 GMT Monday to discuss the issue of rising prices. 

  Bond trading volumes were lower Monday as many players awaited sovereign debt auctions lined up for April. The government is scheduled to sell INR200 billion of bonds during the month under its market borrowing program. 

  The first auction of INR100 billion is scheduled April 4-11. 

  In the currency market, the Indian rupee weakened against the U.S. dollar Monday, as a fall in local stocks triggered capital outflows. 

  The dollar ended at INR40.10, up from INR39.90 at Friday's close. 

  ""I don't see any major gains in the rupee, since the volume of capital inflows aren't going to be as heavy as last year,"" said V. Rajagopal, head of foreign exchange trading at Kotak Mahindra Bank. 

  India's stocks fell Monday, with the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex declining 726.85 points, or 4.4%, to end at 15644.44. 

  Rajagopal said he expects the dollar to trade in a band of INR39.75-INR40.25 during April.

  Where Fed 

  Marches, Others 

  May Follow 

 

  Among the world's major central banks, the Federal Reserve looks as out-of-place as a person showing up to a black-tie affair in a Halloween costume. 

  Since September, the Fed has slashed its federal-funds-rate target by 2 1/2 percentage points to 3%, as aggressive as its cuts going into the 2001 recession. 

  Other central bankers have been loath to follow the Fed's lead. The Bank of England has cut its target rate just twice since December, by just a half percentage point in total. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan haven't touched rates since credit problems emerged last year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been raising rates, with the most recent increase coming yesterday. 

  ECB and Bank of England policy makers meet this week and are expected to keep rates unchanged. Despite signs of economic weakness, inflation in Europe and the United Kingdom has been high, making them reluctant to pursue stimulative rate cuts. 

  Why the disconnect? The Fed might be on the wrong course. Many complain its easy-money policy is fueling global commodity inflation, making it harder for other central banks to do their jobs. 

  Another possibility is that other nations are insulated from America's woes and are correctly staying out of the U.S. mess. If the global economy was really slowing, this argument goes, commodity prices would be falling, not soaring. 

  A third possibility, and probably the most likely, is that the rest of the world will eventually have to catch up to the Fed. The Australian central bank, even as it raised interest rates, noted tighter credit conditions and softer business and consumer sentiment in commodity-rich Australia and warned that ""global growth will be below trend in 2008."" Canada's central bank has also gotten into the rate-cutting act, saying the U.S. slump would have ""significant spillover effects on the global economy."" 

  Central bank easing policies will eventually converge, says Lena Komileva, Group-of-Seven economist at Tullett Prebon. The slow response of others means their economies might keep slowing even after a U.S. recovery sets in. 

 

  Corporate Insiders Decide 

  It's Time to Buy Shares 

 

  Here's a silver lining in the market. Corporate executives are gobbling up their own companies' shares. 

  Insider buying in February was 26% higher than the average for the month over the past six years, while selling was about half the average, Thomson Financial says. Nearly half of the buying came from large-cap companies, including hard-hit financial and technology companies. 

  Some investors watch how executives treat their own companies' shares; they might buy when seeing opportunities other investors don't. 

  ""I like to see that management thinks their company is at a price that represents some value,"" says Robert Pavlik, chief investment officer at Oaktree Asset Management. 

  The catch is that insiders aren't always the smartest money or the best signal about a stock. Sometimes executives don't know what's about to hit them, or they're buying or selling for reasons that don't mesh with the rest of the market. Despite a number of MBIA insider buys in late 2007, for example, the shares are down more than 30% this year.

  MUMBAI (Dow Jones)--Indian government bonds rose Tuesday as a retreat in global crude oil prices provided a respite from the recent upward surge in commodity prices, dealers said. 

  The benchmark 7.99% 2017 10-year bond ended at INR102.63, up from INR102.39 Monday. Its yield fell 3 basis points to 7.59%. 

  ""The sentiment is a little better now with most commodity prices coming off their highs, but a sustained rally looks difficult unless inflation pressures ease substantially,"" said a dealer at a foreign bank. 

  Inflationary pressures have been keeping the bond market subdued, as the central bank and the federal government join the global battle to curb inflation and put the issue of lower interest rates on the back burner. 

  India's wholesale price index-based weekly inflation rate is now hovering above the central bank's stated comfort level of 5%, and experts expect it will stay there, or above, for some time to come. 

  ""In the short-term, bond market sentiments are likely to stay cautious as negative factors such as advance tax outflows, uncertainty on the liquidity front, currently outweigh the positives,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a note to clients. 

  Some INR450 billion to INR550 billion of funds are expected to leave the system when advance tax payments by local companies are completed. 

  In the currency market, the Indian rupee ended higher against the dollar Tuesday as local shares rose, improving sentiment and prompting dollar selling across the board, dealers said. 

  The dollar slipped to INR40.51 from a six-month high of INR40.73 Monday, ahead of a crucial U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting later Tuesday. 

  The market expects the Fed to lower its interest rates by up to 100 basis points to anchor a teetering economy. The latest in a series of rate cuts is likely to widen the differential between India and the U.S. to 5.75 percentage points and may give a boost to dwindling capital inflows into India. 

  But some analysts say rate arbitrage may not be enough to ease the rupee's depreciation. 

  ""Even if the Fed cuts its rates further, I'm not sure how much role a wider rate arbitrage will play in attracting foreign funds if the equities sentiment remains damp... What we need is investor confidence returning,"" said Rohan Lasrado, head of foreign exchange trading at HDFC Bank. 

  He expects the dollar to trade in a INR40.50-INR41.00 range in the near term.

317,"2ndUPDATE: F&amp;P Appliances Shifts Production, Restructures Ops

 
   (updates with background, comments from trade minister and fund manager) 
 

  By Rebecca Howard 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 
 

  WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Fisher & Paykel Appliances Ltd. (FPA.NZ) is relocating three of its manufacturing sites to low-cost countries in a bid to lift earnings hit by high labor costs, rising global steel prices and a strong New Zealand dollar. 

  Chief Executive John Bongard cited ongoing escalation in manufacturing costs, particularly in New Zealand and Australia, as the main reason for relocating production to Thailand, Mexico and Italy. A free trade agreement between New Zealand and China, inked earlier this month, was also a contributory factor, Bongard said. 

  The home appliances manufacturer has been hard hit by high labor costs, soaring global oil and steel prices, a strong local currency and the country's high interest rates denting consumption. 

  ""We have been faced for many years with an extremely unhelpful exchange rate fueled by high interest rates. Increasingly complex and costly compliance costs of manufacturing in our home countries have not assisted,"" Bongard said. 

  He added that ""free trade agreements with low cost labor countries like China and Thailand have created a playing field we are unable to compete in."" 

  Bongard's comments sparked a swift reaction from New Zealand Minister of Trade Phil Goff. 

  ""I do not believe...that free trade agreements by New Zealand, such as that with China, are a key factor in the decision to relocate,"" Goff said in a statement. 

   Around 1,070 of the company's employees will lose their jobs as a result of the move, including 430 from its Range & DishDrawer factory in Dunedin, New Zealand. 

  Rickey Ward, joint domestic equity manager at Tyndall Investment Management, said the decision had been forced upon the company by several factors. 

  ""This is a reflection of the current economic environment and the challenges that a company like this faces when it tries to grow,"" said Ward. 

  Ward said that the move was positive as Fisher & Paykel Appliances will be closer to its main markets, curbing transport costs. 

  ""Getting closer to your markets is a better idea for them and to a certain extent this is quite reflective of that, trying to get closer to markets where they have got growth,"" he said. 

   Investors cheered the company's move, sending the stock surging 13.6% to a five-week high of NZ$2.50 around 0133 GMT. The spike came after the stock slid to  NZ$2.11 Wednesday, the lowest level since its split from Fisher & Paykel Healthcare  in late 2001. 

  ""Here is a company that was somewhat beaten up because of short-term news, clearly if the numbers are to be believed from what (CEO John Bongard) was saying it will be enormously beneficial to the share price,"" Ward said. 

 

  Relocation Benefits 

 

  Fisher & Paykel Appliances mainly operates in New Zealand, Australia, the U.S. and Europe. 

  According to the company, the move is expected to save at least NZ$50 million a year. 

  The Range & DishDrawer factory in Dunedin, New Zealand, along with the refrigerator plant in Brisbane, Australia and the Dynamic Cooking Systems or DCS cooking factory in California, U.S. will all be relocated over the next 12-18 months. 

  Fisher & Paykel Appliances was already in the process of moving some of its electronics and laundry appliances facilities to Thailand in a bid to compete with low-cost rivals. 

  It will make use of that site, existing sites in Italy and a new refrigeration production plant it has agreed to buy in Mexico from Whirlpool Corp. for US$33 million. 

  The remaining production facilities in Auckland, New Zealand (Refrigeration and Production Machinery Ltd), Ohio, U.S. (Laundry) and Borso del Grappa, Italy (Cooking) will not be affected, the company said. 

  Hamilton Hindin Greene adviser James Smalley said: ""Its just a reflection of the fact that if companies want to remain competitive in the global environment they've got to minimize their costs as much as they can."" 

  There will be a one-off cost of approximately NZ$50 million and the capital expenditure is estimated around NZ$100 million. 

  The cost of the moves will be substantially funded from the sale of what will become surplus property in New Zealand and Australia,"" and expected to net NZ$100 million, the company added. 

  The head office will remain located in New Zealand and the products will continue to be developed in New Zealand by Fisher & Paykel Appliances engineers, said Bongard.

318,"2nd UPDATE:Haiti Lawmakers Vote To Dismiss PM Over Food Riots

 

  (Updates with more comment from Haitians, U.N. mission) 

 

  PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)--Haitian lawmakers on Saturday dismissed Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis, hoping to defuse widespread anger of rising food prices that had led to days of deadly protests and looting. 

  President Rene Preval, who earlier in the day announced plans to cut the price of rice, immediately said he would seek a replacement for Alexis, who took office in 2006 with Preval's backing to head a Cabinet meant to unite the poor and fractious nation. 

  ""I think that will satisfy the people,"" said Sen. Youri Latortue following the vote in parliament in which 16 of 27 lawmakers backed Alexis' ouster. Latortue said lawmakers ousted the prime minister because he did not boost food production and refused to set a date for the departure of U.N. peacekeepers. 

  But about 25 people gathered outside the national palace after the dismissal, chanting ""Aristide or death,"" in reference to exiled former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 

  U.N. peacekeepers called Alexis' dismissal a ""serious setback"" and said they look forward to the early appointment of a new government, according to mission spokeswoman Sophie Boutaud de la Combe. 

  The prime minister's ouster reflects frustration over soaring food prices in a nation where most people live on less than $2 a day and chronic hunger had become unbearable in recent months. 

  The rage erupted in days violent clashes with U.N. peacekeepers and looting across Haiti that had abated by late Thursday, but not before leaving five people dead. Protesters even stormed the presidential palace on Tuesday, charging its main gate with a rolling dumpster and yelling for Preval to step down. 

  On Saturday, U.N. military commander Maj. Gen. Carlos Alberto Dos Santos Cruz told The Associated Press that calm was returning across the country, with some transportation resuming and people going back to work. 

  But Haiti could encounter more chaos with Alexis' ousting, according to Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin America and Caribbean Center at Florida International University. He said the dismissal creates a political vacuum and that senators might now go after Preval because he hasn't implemented many changes. 

  ""President Preval has to be careful. Anytime President Preval has to engage himself speaking, he also needs to engage the private sector in his discussions,"" said Senator Jean Hector Anacasis, a member of Preval's Lespwa party. 

  Emmanuel Joseph, a 26-year-old from the seaside slum of Cite Soleil, said residents there are still planning to protest Monday because they are hungry. 

  Some residents felt their plight wouldn't improve regardless of the dismissal. 

  ""Alexis left? What's the difference?"" asked Jackson Aubri, a 28-year-old chicken vendor. 

  In another bid to deal with anger of food prices, Preval said Saturday that the price of a 50-pound bag of rice will drop from $51 to $43. 

  The price reduction went into effect immediately and will last for one month, at which point government officials will reassess the economic situation. 

  The Haitian president said the government will use international aid money to subsidize the price of rice and that the private sector has agreed to knock $3 off the price of each bag. 

  Globally, food prices have risen 40% since mid-2007. Haiti is particularly affected because it imports nearly all of its food, including more than 80% of its rice. Much of its once-productive farmland has been abandoned as farmers struggle to grow crops in soil decimated by erosion, deforestation, flooding and tropical storms. 

  On Friday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement banning government officials from traveling to Haiti following the violent demonstrations. 

  It also advised American citizens to consider leaving the impoverished Caribbean country where protests over high costs of living left five dead in the countryside. The warning comes despite a general sense of calm settling over Port-au-Prince. 

  ""If you don't need to stay, you might consider departing,"" said James Ellickson-Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. 

  An estimated 19,000 U.S. citizens live in Haiti, most dual-nationals who live in the capital. More than 140 American citizens have been kidnapped since 2005, but few were short-term visitors, the U.S. Embassy said.

319,"WSJ(4/23) Philippines Pressed To Rethink Rice Subsidies

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By James Hookway in Manila and Karen Lane in Singapore 

  Asia has enough rice stocks to meet demand despite low inventories, according to the Asian Development Bank, but prices are showing no sign of receding. 

  Some politicians and economists are pressing the Philippines -- the world's biggest importer of rice -- to change how it subsidizes the staple grain because of the distortions such measures can introduce into the rice market. 

  Rice prices have risen 150% this year, with Thai medium grade rice -- a de facto benchmark -- reaching a record $960 a ton this week. The reasons for the run-up include rising demand among fast-growing Asian economies, poor harvests and stiff competition from biofuels for cultivated land. But some economists and politicians say the impact is being exacerbated by the way some governments restrict exports or distort the market through elaborate and corruption-prone subsidies. 

  In the Philippines, Sen. Edgardo Angara is among a small but growing movement of people asking the government to give up subsidies that are designed to make rice affordable to the poorest Filipinos, but that distort the market and lead to hoarding. Mr. Angara argues that the Philippines' state-run National Food Authority should give up its monopolistic powers to import and subsidize rice and leave the job to the private sector. 

  ""If private rice traders are allowed to import and sell rice without any restriction, the supply and price of rice will likely stabilize,"" he said in a speech to the Senate on Monday. Mr. Angara, who once served as secretary of agriculture, also pressed his case to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo during a legislative conference Tuesday. 

  Rajat Nag, managing director general of the Asian Development Bank, told reporters in Singapore Tuesday that steps taken by some countries to curb rice exports or introduce price controls are having ""counterproductive effects"" on what farmers choose to plant and when. Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia have limited rice exports, increasing the demand for rice from the biggest exporter, Thailand. Mr. Nag said export bans could hurt other countries and damage longer-term trade relations. 

  He added that Asia shouldn't panic about rice supplies because the region has enough stocks to cover demand, even though they are at their lowest level in decades. 

  The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization this month forecast this year's global rice production will expand 1.8% from a year earlier, relieving the pressure on prices. In the Philippines, removing rice subsidies would help eliminate theft and corruption in the state-controlled rice-distribution systems, Mr. Angara says. 

  Philippine investigators have filed several complaints against rice traders who have taken subsidized rice and repackaged it for sale at double the price on the commercial market -- pricing out many poorer Filipinos who were supposed to get it. With the money saved from scrapping subsidies -- projected to be at least $1.3 billion this year -- the Philippines could establish a fund to directly provide money to the people who most need it to buy rice, said Mr. Angara. He said the Philippines did this during previous rice shortages. 

  Perhaps most important, the Philippines also could invest money now spent to subsidize rice consumption on improving its rice output, Mr. Angara says. Like the Philippines, many governments in the region have assumed they would be able to easily and cheaply make up shortfalls in domestic production on the international market. But as this year has shown, stable pricing can't always be taken for granted. 

  Ms. Arroyo has earmarked $1 billion to improve the country's rice-producing capabilities and has called for a freeze on converting agricultural land into housing or industrial developments in a bid to jump-start a new wave of rice farming.

320,"UPDATE:UAE Carrefour To Keep 52 Basic Foods At 07 Prices

 

  (Adds further Carrefour comments, analyst comment) 

  DUBAI (Zawya Dow Jones)--MAF Hypermarkets signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Economy Thursday to maintain the 2007 prices of 52 basic food commodities in all Carrefour stores in the Persian Gulf state. 

  The MoU is in line with ""continuous efforts by the   Ministry to stabilize prices, reduce inflation levels, maintain market balance and protect the consumer,"" said Mohammed Al Shihhi, undersecretary at the Ministry of Economy. 

  The government aims to reduce inflation in the U.A.E. from 10.9% to 5% this year through a series of economic measures, but not through dropping its peg to the weak dollar which economists say accounts for up to 40% of total inflation in the country. 

  Food items that will have prices capped include rice, eggs, milk, meat, bread, tea, water, sugar, salt, vegetable oil and beans among others. 

  The initiative, which applies to all buyers regardless of whether they are U.A.E. nationals or expatriates, will be effective from Sunday till December 2008, said Henri Changeux, Senior Vice President of Carrefour. 

  Up to 70% of the items on the list are Carrefour's most popular brands and Carrefour will not be raising prices of other goods to make up for the expected loss in revenues, Changeux said, adding the initiative was part of its ""social responsibility"". 

  ""We support this initiative, our job is to fulfill the needs of the customer at the best price,"" Changeux told reporters at a press conference in Dubai. 

  Last week Lulu Hypermarket Group signed a similar MoU to cap prices of 32 goods. Its Chairman Yousif Ali said in a statement: ""The Group responded quickly to the MoE's initiative based on its conviction about the importance of such programs to eliminate any negative practices that threaten free competition in the UAE."" 

  Ali went on to say the UAE's private sector should ""not focus solely on profits"" and pointed out ""the danger of inflation for both the society and the economy"". 

  BACKDOOR DEAL 

  But analysts said both profit-making businesses were unlikely to have agreed to such an initiative without an agreement with the government to make up for losses to be incurred. 

  ""There must have been some sort of backdoor deal because there are definitely losses and someone needs to shoulder these losses,"" said Eckart Woertz, chief economist at Gulf Research Center. 

  He added the government was likely reimbursing them in some way such as lowering rents or electricity rates. 

  Both Lulu and Carrefour were unavailable for comment on potential losses to revenues when contacted by Zawya Dow Jones. 

  In March the Union Cooperative Society in Dubai agreed to fix prices on 16 basic goods at 2007 levels. 

  MAF hypermarkets operate Carrefour stores through a joint venture.

321,"FOCUS: Copper Bulls Dominate As CESCO Week Starts In Chile

 
   By Andrea Hotter 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--If copper industry commentaries ahead of the annual CESCO week dinner in Santiago and associated events are anything to go by, the bull run in prices remains firmly intact, with new record highs likely over the next few months. 

  Producers, analysts and traders alike have been extremely bullish on copper since the market's bull run got fully underway a couple of years ago. 

  With the occasional lull in trading activity as participants took profits, copper has been buoyed by a persistent contraction in supplies amid ever-increasing demand from the world's biggest buyer of the metal, China. 

  In March, London Metal Exchange copper prices peaked at an all-time high of $8,820 a metric ton. But while these factors remain, on the surface at least, ongoing bullish factors for copper, the weight of speculative money and fears that the U.S. recession will spread are new themes that are continually cropping up. 

  Opinions over copper's future price direction remain mixed, with the sector looking to CESCO to provide sentiment going forward. 

  ""Metal markets seem to be torn between rallying on the back of a weaker dollar on the one hand, and selling off on those occasions when the realization sets in that slowing growth, which is driving the dollar lower in the first place, has the potential to knock demand back,"" said U.S.-based MF Global analyst Ed Meir. 

  ""How this tussle eventually plays out remains to be seen, but the demand component will eventually prevail and exert downward pressure on metals,"" he added. 

  This will be especially true if the U.S. slowdown starts to spread to Europe, Japan, and then on to Asian economies, as may already be happening, Meir noted. 

  Yet for the moment, market sentiment remains mostly in a bullish mood, optimistic that any recession in the U.S. will be short-lived, and more than offset by strength from China and other emerging markets. And for sure, the latest round of generally poor economic data out of the U.S. is still failing to deter investors. 

  ""The copper market obviously sees solid fundamental value in the medium term, given prices edged higher (last week) on the back of U.S. economic data that in other circumstances would have sent investors running,"" said Michael Lewis, Deutsche Bank's global head of commodities research. 

  ""The institute of Supply Management's manufacturing and non-manufacturing monthly indices both came in at levels that indicate a contraction in the economy, but copper investors took heart because they both came in higher than the previous month,"" he added. 

  While this positive attitude is undoubtedly helping to sustain copper prices, traders are now starting to warn that a more cautious approach is needed. Noting copper prices have exceeded pre-credit crunch levels, traders said this is partly because the market has adapted to the new environment, and partly because analyst reports remain staunchly bullish, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve officially using the word 'recession.' 

  ""This sort of frank Fed-speak talk is very rare and surely an omen of what is really coming down the pipe,"" said RBC Capital Market's London-based director and head of base metals Alex Heath. 

  Noting that bullish commentaries on a weak dollar boosting demand amid low inventories and supply side worries ""have been the underlying support of the metal for a while now,"" Heath said that ""ultimately the reason we may make new contract highs (in copper) in the short term is the power of investment money as it feeds on momentum."" 

 
   Copper A Speculative Bubble? 
 

  Investor flows into commodities have been well documented for some time now, and are widely viewed as a new fundamental factor in the market. While it's difficult to quantify the exact worth of this money flow, consensus estimates calculate that around $30 billion of fresh investment entered commodities in the first quarter of the year. 

  While this has driven prices higher, copper's also slumped as investors reassessed likely commodity-demand levels - and therefore also prices - after their bull run. And this realization that copper price appreciation is no longer a safe one-way bet has brought fears that copper may be a speculative bubble waiting to burst. 

  What makes it difficult for participants to be sure that investor flows are top-heavy and that copper is set for a sharp decline is the fact that supply/demand fundamentals for the industrial metal have so far proven to be much stronger than expected in 2008. 

  This is largely on account of ongoing supply losses at the mine level, and weather-related production problems at Chinese smelters and refineries at the start of the year. 

  Even output in Chile, the world's biggest copper producer and home to the world's largest mines, is coming under scrutiny. 

  State-owned producer Codelco, the world's largest, has been hit by falling production over the last few years, and this will fall again due to declining ore grades and delays to new projects, the company has said. 

  The threat of strikes is a current and very serious problem, while energy, water and sulfuric acid shortages are also threatening to crimp already reduced output. Around 25% of the world's copper production relies on acid to process oxide ores, and with the raw material at record high prices, this is an additional burden to smaller producers in particular. 

  Looking ahead, new production growth is under threat. Countries like Congo and Zambia are widely expected to see delays to new projects and larger projects, analysts said, with energy problems once again rearing their head. 

  Even larger projects like Tenke Fungurume, KOV and Kolwezi Tailings could encounter further delays, given severe electricity shortages in Congo's Katanga Province. 

  According to Credit Suisse analyst Jeremy Gray, who recently visited Congo, much of the spare power in the region has now been taken by smaller Chinese copper smelters that are producing between 100,000 to 150,000 tons of contained blister copper. 

  ""As the license review in Congo dragged on, the Chinese used the window to take the spare power away from many of the larger projects,"" Gray said. ""Tenke, KOV and Kolwezi Tailings may only account for some 500,000 tons of additional supply, but in our estimates, they still account for 11% of future copper supply in the next six years,"" he added. 

  All this as copper stocks in global warehouses continue to slide. There have been numerous conspiracy theories over this, including that hedge funds and merchants have been buying metal to store it in private warehouses or ship it between ports so it doesn't show up in supply and demand statistics, making the market look tighter as a result. 

  If this is true, it seems to be working. Official data suggests that although demand in the rest of the world will be at best flat this year, analysts said the fate of the copper market rests squarely on the shoulders of China, which accounts for over 25% of world demand. 

  With CESCO week set to discuss whether China has truly decoupled from the developed world or not, data so far suggests that Chinese copper demand is be around 10%-12% this year. 

  While this is down from over 20% last year, largely due to a drop in the export portion, analysts said the domestic portion looks likely to stay strong. Apparent copper demand growth has slowed in the past two months not due to any slowdown in underlying consumption, analysts say, but due to bad winter weather and the surge in copper prices discouraging buying. 

  If world demand for copper re-accelerates once more, it will catch many consumers, who've been living hand-to-mouth, unawares. But if it doesn't, and the weight of investment money heads for the exit, copper's future price gains look anything but assured.

322,"Vietnam Rice Export Prices Up 10% On Tight Local Supply

 

  HANOI (Dow Jones)--Export prices of Vietnamese rice were 10% higher in the week ended Tuesday after the government reaffirmed that the country will only export between 3.5 million and 4.0 million tons of rice, due to tight local supply, traders said. Last year, the country exported 4.5 million tons. 

  ""The recent rice crises last week in the two big cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, where 16 million people are living, have prompted the government to increase state reserves of rice, resulting in more pressure for higher prices,"" said a trader with a rice export firm in Vinh Long province. 

  He said higher rice prices have encouraged farmers to expand paddy cultivation, but farmers also have to pay higher production costs estimated at more than $800 per metric ton for 5% high-quality rice. 

  Traders who are based in the Mekong delta region predict export prices will remain above $1,000/ton in the next two or three months due to strong global demand. 

  In Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong delta region, private traders were quoting high-quality 5% broken rice at $1,100 a metric ton freight on board, up from $1,000 last week. They didn't offer 25% broken grade. 

  Traders said retail prices of high-quality rice for domestic consumption in the Mekong delta region are VND14 million-VND15 million ($870-$930) a metric ton, and in Hanoi are VND16 million/ton.

  8:21 (Dow Jones) US dollar's stronger against euro and yen on renewed optimism on the US economy, easing risk aversion and dip in crude prices from recent highs. Fedspeak yesterday highlighted inflation concerns, reinforcing impression that recent rate-cutting cycle may be at an end. EUR/USD recently at 1.5443 from 1.5481 late yesterday, while USD/JPY at 105.22 from 104.72. EUR/JPY at 162.49 from 162.12, according to EBS. GBP/USD at 1.9425 from 1.9471; USD/CHF at 1.0559 from 1.0523. (RFO) 

  8:12 (Dow Jones) Treasurys selling off, extending yesterday's losing streak due to concern over inflation and shifting view on Fed rate policy. Several Fed officials tin speeches yesterday highlighted price pressures. Market raises bets on a rate hike as early as October following retail sales and import prices data Tuesday. April CPI at 8:30am. The 2-yr note's down 5/32 to yield 2.56% while 10-yr's down 11/32 to yield 3.95%. Benchmark yield curve flattens to 139 BP from 144 BP. (MOZ) 

  8:03 (Dow Jones) Fast-food drive-in operator Sonic (SONC) admits at investor briefing that it got too aggressive managing labor costs and saw service slip. Also, discount promotions didn't pay off as hoped. Management's planning a high-low pricing strategy to boost returns. But analysts take wait-and-see stance. ""It is too early to buy,"" Morgan Stanley says. JPMorgan keeps neutral rating, says shares fully valued. (RLG) 

  7:54 (Dow Jones) What stood out at GM's annual banker meeting yesterday ""was GM's acknowledgment of the potential need to raise additional liquidity,"" Lehman says. ""We see the need to raise about $9 bil over the next two years to refinance debt, with potential additional needs for operational cash burn from mix shift or commodities,"" firm says. ""We remain cautious until the impact of this more fully works its way into GM valuation,"" Lehman adds. (JHS) 

  7:42 (Dow Jones) Goldman Sachs cuts 2Q and full-year estimates for Bear Stearns (BSC), Lehman (LEH) and Morgan Stanley, citing an operating environment that's been ""extraordinarily challenging."" While poor performance in recent quarters was mainly due to asset write-downs, ""2Q2008 results are likely to suffer from a combination of slower client and investment banking activity, poor principal and proprietary trading results, basis risk on hedging activity, and losses from the tightening of certain structured credit liabilities,"" Goldman says. Now sees BSC's 2Q EPS at 60c vs prior $2.35 view; LEH estimated to lose 20c/share vs prior $1.35 EPS; forecasts MS EPS at 80c vs prior $1.60. (JHS) 

  7:30 (Dow Jones) Essential stuff like food and energy are getting more expensive, and there's no getting around that reality. So, will there be any surprises when we see April CPI at 8:30am? Perhaps a lower-than-expected number would be a bit of a shocker, but common sense would likely chalk that up to statistical anomalies. Another dose of Fedspeak also coming before US markets open; weekly inventory data from the energy complex due at 10:30am. S&P futures down 3.90; 10-yr lower, yiel at 3.94%. (JHS)

324,"WSJA(5/12) Inflation Spurs India To Limit Futures Trade

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) 
   By Niraj Sheth 

  New Delhi -- IN AN EFFORT to curb inflation, India's government has suspended futures trade in four commodities, and many economists expect further restrictions in this nascent market. 

  Inflation at the wholesale level has been hovering above 7% on an annual basis, well above the government's comfort zone. The government sees futures markets as contributors to India's staggering rise in food prices and banned futures trading in rice and wheat last year. Last week, it banned futures trading in soy oil, chick peas, potatoes and rubber for at least four months. 

  But critics said the ban will exacerbate rather than relieve inflation by shutting down valuable market-pricing mechanisms and encouraging traders to move to the country's untaxed and unregulated black market of so-called dabba traders. 

  The new suspensions came as a surprise after a government-appointed committee reported last month that it couldn't find any conclusive evidence that futures trading drove up prices. It declined to recommend a trading suspension. But with national elections coming within a year, the ruling coalition, which is led by the Congress Party, faces protests and dissent from left-wing partners, who have been clamoring for action to bring down the price of food staples. 

  Even some in the government have doubts that the suspension will have an effect on prices. ""We were opposed to the suspensions,"" said B.C. Khatua, chairman of the Forwards Markets Commission, which supervises the country's futures exchanges. ""But in a democracy, you have to compromise."" 

  India's futures markets include only a small proportion of the participants in the agricultural sector. The average daily volume traded on the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange, the main market for agricultural futures, is $600 million. India's overall agricultural output was $129 billion in 2006, the latest data available. The small size of the market means that, at best, it has little effect on food prices and, at worst, it can be easily manipulated by relatively small sums of money, traders and analysts said. 

  One major concern is that banning futures trading takes away early warnings about price jumps. Farmers, who could look to futures prices as a gauge of the market, now have little alternative but to sell at the spot-market price. 

  Futures trading represents ""the canary in the coal mine,"" said Ajay Shah, senior fellow at the government-funded National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. ""It's not right to blame futures trading as the cause of price rises."" 

  The government has made the case that global factors and speculation are pushing up food prices as much as supply-and-demand issues. ""Worse than a price rise is the sentiment of a price rise; worse than inflation is the fear of inflation,"" Kamal Nath, minister of Commerce and Industry, said in a recent interview. ""People tend to stock up and create artificial demand."" 

  Many traders and analysts said that if inflation doesn't dissipate, a wider ban on agricultural-futures trading is likely. The government said it has no such plans now. 

  Already, the suspensions on futures trading may be pushing more people to dabba traders. These illegal brokers take prices from official exchanges and let individuals ""buy"" commodities. However, unlike in the official markets, no actual deliverable product is involved in the transaction, and buyers are just betting on changes in prices. Such traders -- dabba means ""box"" in Hindi -- aren't taxed or regulated, leaving participants with little security if a broker turns hostile. ""Because the Indian commodities-futures market is not allowed to operate, people feel aggrieved and go into this type of trading to keep their risk management maintained,"" said Mr. Khatua, of the Forwards Markets Commission. 

  Even as India clamps down on futures trading at home, it quietly has been placing its own orders on wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade, two people familiar with the situation said. Over the past year, the government slowly has built up a stack of options to buy 100 million tons of wheat in case of domestic shortages -- a stance some saw as hypocritical, considering the government's stance on futures trading in India. Government officials couldn't be reached to comment over the weekend.

325,"2nd UPDATE:ECB Draghi:CPI Main Threat As Fincl Storm Not Over

 

  (Adds Draghi remarks, background) 

 

  ROME (Dow Jones)--European Central Bank board member Mario Draghi Saturday said the recent buildup in inflationary pressures following the sharp rise in energy and food prices, coupled with the U.S. economic slowdown, represented the major threats to the world economy. 

  He added that it was too early to say whether the financial turbulence - stemming from the U.S. mortgage crisis that began in August 2007- was over. 

  ""The principal source of concern remains the continued rise in the price of energy and other raw materials,"" said Draghi, who heads the Bank of Italy and the Financial Stability Forum, a global panel of regulators charged with monitoring the financial market crisis. 

  The central banker said the price increase in energy and other commodities were ""having a recessionary impact on the advanced economies and feeding inflation, thus constraining the monetary policy stance."" 

  Record oil prices and the recent surge in food prices are creating major headaches for central bankers around the world, which risk stoking inflation by lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. Moreover, the recent price rises are eroding households' purchasing power, hurting consumer spending and the wider economy. 

  The inflation rate in the euro zone hit a 16-year high in May as oil prices surged, reinforcing a growing consensus that the ECB won't cut its key interest rate this year. Consumer prices in the 15 countries that use the euro rose 3.6% from a year earlier in May, keeping the rate above the ECB's target ceiling of just under 2% for the ninth straight month. 

  Draghi, who helps set ECB monetary policy in the 15-country euro zone, said the central bank had successfully managed to keep inflation under control, with higher consumer prices not translating into higher wages for now. 

  ""The firm anchoring of inflation expectations has allowed the European Central Bank to keep interest rates unchanged for quite some time, thus helping to support the economy,"" Draghi said, adding the ECB remains firmly focused on its medium-term price stability objective. 

  His remarks are likely to reinforce expectations that the ECB will continue to keep rates on hold this year. While the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have cut interest rates in recent months to boost economic growth, the ECB has left its main rate unchanged since June 2007 to keep a lid on inflation. 

  Turning to the market crisis, Draghi said it was too early to say whether the financial turbulence was over. He said that although tensions in some markets were easing, normal conditions have yet to be restored. 

  ""The financial turmoil that swept over the major advanced economies brought to an end a long period of growth, low inflation and plentiful credit. It is too early to say that it has passed,"" Draghi said, adding it was also too soon to assess its full impact on the world economy. 

  The central banker said that the financial system that will emerge from the current crisis must have different rules, less debt and more capital. 

  As head of the Financial Stability Forum, Draghi last month presented a report to the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations that included a series of recommendations for major financial firms, central banks, regulatory bodies and other groups to improve transparency in the financial system and address lax risk-management practices that contributed to the current market crisis.

326,"UPDATE: Thai Refiners Asked To Cut Ex-Refinery Diesel Price

 

  (Adds government's plan to ask more refiners to cut prices.) 

 

  BANGKOK (Dow Jones)--Thailand's Energy Minister Poonpirom Liptapanlop said Monday the ministry has asked oil refiners owned by state-run oil and gas conglomerate PTT PCL (PTT.TH) to cut the ex-refinery price of diesel products by up to THB1 per liter for six months. 

  The move, which would lower refining margins, is designed to soften the blow to the domestic economy from record global oil prices. 

  Refineries under PTT - Thai Oil PCL (TOP.TH), PTT Aromatics & Refining PCL (PTTAR.TH), IRPC PCL (IRPC.TH) and Bangchak Petroleum PCL (BCP.TH) - will consider the request and get back to the ministry next week, said PTT President Prasert Bunsumpun after meeting with officials. 

  The four companies account for 70% of the country's refining capacity of about 1 million barrels a day. They produces a total of 32 million liters of diesel per day. 

  The impact on each company would vary, Prasert said. 

  The ministry will also ask Esso Thailand)(ESSO.TH) and  Star Petroleum Refining Co., a Thai unit of U.S.-based Chevron Corp. (CVX), to lower their diesel prices, said Energy Ministry Permanent Secretary Pornchai Rujiprapa. 

  Pornchai said the discount that refineries offer will be contributed to the state Oil Fund to help the fishing and public transportation sectors cope with rising oil prices.

327,"ENERGY MATTERS: Saudi Output Hike Stokes Slim Capacity Fear

 
   By David Bird 
   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enough is enough. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has decided that crude oil prices edging toward $140 a barrel are too high. 

  That's spurred talk of Saudi output climbing to 10 million barrels a day for the first time since 1981. 

  The planned rise will be the showpiece of an oil producer-consumer meeting called by the king for June 22 in Jeddah. The big question for the oil market is whether Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and de facto OPEC leader, can pump enough oil to bring prices down. 

  Each barrel added to the market shrinks the already tight cushion of spare capacity, a vital issue in a market beset with geopolitical concerns spanning from Venezuela to Nigeria to Iran and Iraq. 

  The Middle East Economic Survey newsletter reported Friday that the Saudis are considering a boost in oil output to 10 million barrels a day, which would be a jump of nearly 6% from current output around 9.45 million barrels a day currently. The recent peak for Saudi output was around 9.6 million barrels a day in the summer of 2005. 

  If past Saudi moves play out again, the output hike will be well underway by the Jeddah talks and presented as a fait accompli in the face of sky-high prices which the kingdom  worries may damage the global economy, particularly poorer nations, and spur investment in alternative energy to the detriment of oil demand. 

  The drive to higher output likely hinges on the Khursaniyah oil field, which had been expected to be on-line at end of last year. Saudi Arabia plans for some 500,000 barrels a day of new light crude to come on line soon from the field, providing relief from cutbacks in similar high-quality crude from unrest in Nigeria. 

 
   Duration Of Rise Crucial 
 

  Crucial to the success of the move will be the duration of the Saudi rise, which will likely be presented as an open-ended commitment until prices come down. 

  In January and again in May, when prices were at below $100 and near $125 a barrel, respectively, the Saudis rejected direct calls from U.S. President George W. Bush for an output increase, but did announce a 300,000 barrels a day rise from June 1 to meet rising customer demand in the U.S. 

  U.S. crude oil stocks posted their biggest-ever decline in May on government records dating to the 1950 as refiners are reluctant to hold pricey inventories amid poor refining margins and an uncertain, but sluggish demand outlook. Global stocks are relatively steady, but supplies are a major worry as OPEC, until now, has clamped down on the taps and supplies from non-OPEC producers have lagged expectations. 

  The Saudis and OPEC have said the supply/demand scenario doesn't justify prices at current levels and have blamed market speculators for the run up in prices. 

  The Jeddah meeting, which is expected to include representatives from large merchant banks who have been issuing forecasts for still higher oil prices of $150 a barrel and beyond, is likely to include an OPEC call for more regulation on oil futures trading. Moves are already underway in the U.S., where OPEC is well aware, too, that legislation has been introduced seeking duck sovereignty issues and allow OPEC members to be sued on anti-trust and price fixing charges. 

  OPEC's monthly report on Friday issued some concern that the already increased Saudi output for June may go straight into inventories, rather than being consumed. Bloated inventories, in a typical market, would push down prices. 

 
   Spare Capacity Shrinkage 
 

  The 300,000 barrels a day Saudi rise from June 1 ""should lead to a higher than normal stockbuild in the third quarter and a contra-seasonal increase in the fourth,"" OPEC said. ""This clearly demonstrates that the market is amply supplied and that claims that the recent surge in prices is due to a supply shortage are unjustified."" 

  Pushing Saudi output to 10 million barrels a day would reduce OPEC's current effective spare capacity to less than 1.2 million barrels a day, using latest figures from the International Energy Agency. 

  In 2004, when Saudi Arabia last announced a unilateral rise in output to push down rising prices, the increase was overwhelmed by surging Chinese demand. The market instead focused on OPEC's razor thin capacity and prices rose, instead of falling. 

  Back then, the Saudis were happy when prices held around $30 a barrel, which they considered a ""fair"" price. The kingdom won't say what the right price is now, only that it shouldn't hurt the global economy or demand for oil and provide fair returns, including in high cost production regions. 

  It's a safe bet, though, that with Saudi eyes on 10 million barrels a day output, they're looking for a price fall of about that order of magnitude - $30.

329,"Chile Stocks Close Lower On Ctrl Bk Rate Hike, DJIA Tumble

 

  By Carolina Pica 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--Chile's benchmark Ipsa stock index closed lower Wednesday on the central bank's decision late Tuesday to raise its key rate 50 basis points and on a tumble in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

  Analysts and market participants widely expected the central bank to raise the key rate, known as TPM, by a quarter of a percentage point to rein in inflation, which is currently running at an annual 8.9%. However, the monetary authority surprised the markets with a half-point hike Tuesday evening. The key TPM rate now stands at 6.75%. 

  The 40-share blue-chip Ipsa index ended at 3,000.58, down 0.6% from Tuesday's close, although it had partly recovered from a 1.5% tumble early in the session. Volume fell to 74.7 billion pesos ($152.6 million) from CLP97.6 billion in the previous session. 

  An auction of a 0.64% stake in Banco de Chile (BCH) accounted for $40 million of the day's volume. Banco de Chile ended 0.4% lower at CLP39.35. 

  Banks and retailers were hard hit by the rate hike as loans and consumer spending will likely taper off, analysts said. Banco Santander Chile (SAN) tumbled 2.7% to close at CLP21.21, while department store retailer La Polar (LAPOLAR.SN) slid 2.9% to CLP2,410.00. 

  Alternative fuel company Schwager (SCHWAGER.SN) was one of the few gainers in the session, jumping 19.4% to close at CLP6.84 on news that it signed a $70 million deal to produce biofuels for the Ventanas division of state copper giant Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile, or Codelco. 

  Local stocks will likely track those on Wall street, analysts said, because concerns about U.S. markets are weighing on investors' minds. 

  In the local bond market, yields on the Chilean central bank bonds ended higher in reaction to the monetary authority's rate hike, traders said. 

  On the official interbank market, the yield on inflation-indexed five-year BCUs ended at 2.91%, up from 2.83% Tuesday, while the yield on 10-year BCUs closed at 3.42%, up from 3.37%. 

  The peso, meanwhile, ended 1% weaker against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, falling to a 23-week low, despite the central bank's 50-basis-point rate hike. 

  The currency opened stronger against the dollar, near CLP480.00, after the central bank's move. The higher Chilean rates widened the spread between local and U.S. rates, fueling dollar inflows as investors search for better returns. But the currency then gave up  its early gains, losing ground as foreign banks and private pension fund managers began making large dollar purchases on the local market, traders said. 

  The peso ended the session at CLP489.70 to the dollar, compared with CLP484.60 at Tuesday's close, after trading in a range of CLP480.25-CLP491.50.

330,"ADB Exec Calls For Tighter Monetary Policies In Asia

 

  KUALA LUMPUR (AP)--Asia's growth is being threatened by spiraling inflation due to higher food and fuel cost, an Asian Development Bank executive warned Sunday, as he called on governments to tighten monetary policies to deal with the scourge. 

  The bank is reviewing its growth forecast of 7.6% this year for Asia, excluding Japan, amid concerns inflation will widen income inequality in the region and cause more people to plunge into poverty, said its managing director general Rajat M.Nag. 

  Asia's growth last year hit a two-decade high of 8.7%. At the same time, the ADB in April forecast inflation to hit 5.1% this year, the highest in a decade. But this forecast may also go up, Nag told The Associated Press. 

  Among the worst hit is Vietnam, where inflation is currently more than 25%. Singapore, Thailand, India, Philippines and Indonesia are looking at inflation rates of between 7.5% and 11%. 

  ""The growth story is in danger because there are inflationary dark clouds in the horizon, which we have to recognize as the greatest concern,"" Nag said on the sidelines of a two-day global economic forum here. 

  ""We feel that monetary policies have to be tightened so that inflationary expectations are tamed,"" he said. Among the measures he suggested were raising interest rates, increasing banks' reserve requirement and ensuring a flexible exchange rate. Some central banks have already reaised borrowing rates in the past two months. 

  Surging food prices, stoked by rising fuel costs that have increased production and transport costs, have triggered protests around the world in recent months. Riots have erupted over food shortages in the Caribbean and Africa and hunger is approaching crisis stage in parts of Asia. 

  A number of Asian nations such as India, Malaysia and Indonesia recently cut fuel subsidies amid rising world oil prices, which is expected to further send inflation soaring. 

  ""Inflation is the most regressive form of taxation and it hits the poor most. In Asia, roughly about a billion people are vulnerable to the food and fuel price increases,"" he said. 

  Nag defended the governments for reducing the unaffordable subsidies. But governments must ensure ""targeted cash support"" for the poor to protect them from the price hikes, he said. 

  Asia, which is home to two-thirds of the world's poor, successfully cut its poverty rate to about 19% currently, from 33% in 1990, but this is under threat due to inflation, he said. 

  Some 600 million people in the region survive on a dollar a day or less, and about 400 million people who live on just above a dollar, making up the most vulnerable group to the price increases. 

  The Manila-based development lending institution last month announced $500 million in emergency aid for poor countries struggling with soaring food prices. It will also double its lending for the agricultural sector in 2009 to $2 billion.

331,"WSJA(6/5) India And Malaysia Trim Fuel Subsidies

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASIA) 
   By Jackie Range in New Delhi and Elffie Chew in Kuala Lumpur 

  Amid record crude-oil prices, India and Malaysia announced increases in fuel prices Wednesday, risking higher inflation rates and a backlash from consumers to relieve mounting pressure from subsidies on national finances. 

  The countries are the latest Asian nations to trim subsidies that have long cushioned consumers -- including manufacturers and other businesses -- from rising energy costs. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan have substantially increased state-regulated fuel prices, as well. 

  India raised the retail prices of gasoline and diesel by about 10% to trim growing losses at state-run oil marketing companies that sell fuel at subsidized rates. Lifting prices for the second time this year, the government will add three rupees (seven U.S. cents) to the price of a liter of diesel and five rupees to a liter of gasoline, effective Thursday. New Delhi also scrapped a 5% import tax on crude oil and cut the import tax on gasoline and diesel to 2.5% from 7.5%. 

  In oil- and gas-producing Malaysia, the government made a much bigger 41% increase in heavily subsidized gasoline prices, and said it would also boost diesel prices and electricity rates. Kuala Lumpur said it plans to start using global market rates for pricing fuel to avert an ever-growing subsidy burden on the country's budget. 

  The decisions to pass along higher fuel costs to consumers were taken despite the threat of higher inflation and possible political unrest in both India and Malaysia. 

  In India, Asia's second fastest-growing major economy, the fuel price increases could further weaken the ruling Congress Party-led coalition government's prospects in a general election that must be held by May in which it is expected to lose ground. The government is already grappling with the political fallout of higher inflation -- now at its highest level since September 2004. 

  In the week ended May 17, India's wholesale price index rose 8.1% from a year earlier. Mumbai-based ratings agency Crisil, predicts the fuel-price increase will push up wholesale price inflation by 0.95 percentage point. But Crisil economist Dharmakirti Joshi doesn't expect the increase to hamper economic growth and is sticking to his forecast that India's gross domestic product will expand 8.1% in the fiscal year ending March 31. 

  Still, higher fuel prices and inflation are likely to turn up the pressure on the Congress Party. Rising inflation was cited as a key reason for its recent failure in elections in the southern state of Karnataka, which followed defeats in contests in several other states. 

  Communist allies of the Congress Party threatened to block roads and rail traffic beginning Thursday to protest the fuel-price increase. The leftist parties, whose support is necessary for India's coalition government to stay in power, want a review of the price decision. But Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murli Deora told a briefing Wednesday ""the government has no other option but to raise prices."" 

  The price increases are intended to help state-run fuel retailers trim mounting losses. The rise will save India's three state-run retailers -- Indian Oil Corp., Hindustan Petroleum Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. -- about $5 billion through increased revenue this fiscal year, Petroleum Secretary M.S. Srinivasan said. However, the companies are expected to continue to lose money. 

  Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya calculates that the fuel-price increase and other measures will reduce India's combined central and state governments' fiscal deficit to about 8.9% of GDP in the current fiscal year from his earlier estimate of 9.3%. Mr. Ahya's estimates include budgeted central and state government spending, along with other items not officially included in their budgets -- such as a recent huge loan waiver for small-scale farmers. In the last fiscal year, which ended March 31, India's official fiscal deficit, by government calculations, was equal to 3.1% of GDP. This fiscal year, the government aims to cut that to 2.5%. 

  In Malaysia, fuel price increases will lift the cost of gasoline to 2.70 ringgit, or about 84 U.S. cents, a liter from 1.92 ringgit, while diesel will increase 63% to 2.58 ringgit a liter. Prices will then be reviewed on a monthly basis, officials said. To cushion the impact of the increases, the government will give owners of small and medium-size cars a yearly 625 ringgit rebate, enough to cover the price increase for up to 800 liters. 

  Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whose ruling Barisan Nasional coalition had its worst election performance in nearly four decades in March, dismissed suggestions the latest price rises could make the government more unpopular. ""It has to be done. It's not an attempt to be popular. We can't satisfy everyone,"" he told reporters. 

  Subsidies in Malaysia, introduced in 1983, have kept its fuel prices among the lowest in Southeast Asia. But the surge in global oil prices has made the subsidies too onerous for the government. Had Wednesday's price increases not been introduced, Malaysia's fuel-subsidy bill would have reached around 50 billion ringgit this year, or about one-third of government budget expenditures. With the price increase, the government expects to save 13.7 billion ringgit, part of which will be used to help subsidize rising food prices.

332,"PREVIEW:Reliance Indus,ONGC 1Q Net Seen Up On High Oil Prices

 

  By Romit Guha 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  TAKING THE PULSE: High crude oil prices are likely to boost the earnings of Reliance Industries Ltd. (500325.BY), India's largest private sector refiner, and state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. (500312.BY) in the April-June quarter. 

  Average crude oil prices have risen 80% from a year earlier and about 29% from the previous quarter, which is likely to help Reliance Industries charge higher prices for its oil products, analysts say. 

  ONGC will also benefit from higher net realizations -  the price at which India's largest oil producer sells crude per barrel, after discounts to state-run refiners - analysts said. 

  ONGC sells crude oil to state-run refiners at a discount to share some of their losses for selling oil products at government-set prices. 

 

  COMPANIES TO WATCH: 

 

  Reliance Industries - Reporting July 24 

  Market Expectations: Nine analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires, on average, expect net profit to rise to INR40.47 billion, up 11.5% from INR36.3 0 billion, on revenue of INR423.85 billion, up 35.5% from INR312.9 billion a year earlier. 

  India's largest company by market capitalization posted a net profit of INR39.12 billion on revenue of INR372.86 billion in the fourth quarter. 

  Key Issues: 

  Flattish petrochemical margins will continue to weigh on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization margins, despite higher refining margins, say analysts. 

  ""The polymer and polyester margins are expected to dip this quarter due to the company's inability to pass on the high feedstock prices to end-product users,"" a Khandwala Securities report said. 

  A poll of five analysts expects a refining margin of $17 per barrel, compared with $15.4 a year earlier and $15.5 in the previous quarter ended March 31. 

 

  Oil & Natural Gas - Reporting July 28 

  Market Expectations: The average of forecasts of seven analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires is for a net profit of INR52.53 billion, up 13.9% from INR46.1 billion a year earlier. Revenue is likely to increase 31% to INR179.42 billion compared with INR136.88 billion a year earlier. 

  It posted a net profit of INR26.27 billion in the fourth quarter, on revenue of INR156.26 billion. 

  Key Issues: 

  Although the higher crude prices will help increase ONGC's gross realizations per barrel, the subsidy burden ""is likely to eat into it, bringing down net realizations,"" said Vinay Nair, an analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Khandwala said. 

  He still expects net realizations to come in ""a strong $72 per barrel"" compared with $52 per barrel in the previous fiscal year ended March 31. 

  The government has said ONGC's subsidies to state-run refiners such as Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, will equal INR450 billion in the current fiscal ending March 31, 2009. The amount of subsidy it takes on in the first quarter will decide its earnings, say analysts. 

  Higher staff costs are likely to weigh on net profit growth, analysts add.

333,"WSJ(7/8) Start-Up Banks See High Hopes Fade

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Sara Schaefer Munoz 

  Bradenton, Fla. -- The future looked bright when several small banks decided to open in this city along the Gulf of Mexico. Property values in southwest Florida were surging, and older start-up banks had sold themselves for handsome profits after just a few years in business. 

  Now, though, for-sale signs dot shopping centers, offices and vacant lots. Developers are desperately hawking vacant houses built on former farmland. In nearby coastal hamlets, some clusters of homes are half-built, with wires dangling from garage ceilings and pipes sticking out of the ground. 

  While just about every bank in town is suffering as a result, Bradenton's latest crop of start-up banks has been hammered. At First Priority Bank, which opened in 2003, nonperforming assets have swelled to 16% of total assets, according to analysts. Coast Financial Holdings Inc., staggered by bad loans to out-of-state investors who hoped to flip homes, nearly failed before being sold to First Banks Inc. of St. Louis last year. 

  ""They went hog-wild and made far too many of these loans,"" said Tramm Hudson, a local banker who advised Coast before it was sold. 

  More than 630 banks were launched from 2003 to 2007, according to SNL Financial LC, a Charlottesville, Va., research firm, raising more than $8.9 billion in capital. 

  But investors who poured money into fledgling banks, which usually rely heavily on commercial loans, are being pounded by the erosion in credit quality. 

  Many of the new banks now face an uphill battle to become profitable beyond the initial losses typical for upstart banks. Some institutions could be forced to put themselves on the block, but buyers are scarce, partly because of suspicions that many banks aren't being honest enough about the problems lurking in their books. 

  The worst performers may have to fight for their lives, though there have been no failures among banks in the latest bumper crop of start-ups. 

  ""Right now, the outlook is very challenging, and it will most likely get worse,"" said Christopher Marinac, research director of FIG Partners LLC, a research firm in Atlanta. 

  The troubles afflicting many of the banks that sprouted when times were good don't pose a major threat to the banking industry because the fledgling banks generally are tiny compared with regional and nationwide lenders. But their stumbles show how far excessive exuberance spread among bankers usually known for conservatism. 

  Many of the shakiest new banks were launched in red-hot real-estate markets that now are reeling from the housing slump. 

  In Florida, about 2.2% of loans at banks started from 2003 to 2006 were considered problem loans at the end of this year's first quarter, according to SNL, meaning that a borrower has stopped paying interest and principal. The definition also can include repossessed property or loans identified as troubled for other reasons. 

  In the Atlanta area, problem loans amounted to 2.9% of overall loans at start-up banks. Banks and thrifts established outside those two areas during the same period averaged 1.1%. 

  Bradenton and the surrounding area of about 687,000 residents, roughly between Tampa and Sarasota, was a center of real-estate speculation. Three new banks formed in Bradenton since 2000 saw the activity as an opportunity for fast growth. Home prices surged 35% in 2005, and bankers eagerly made loans to finance houses, strip malls and condominiums. When the housing market stalled, defaults ballooned. 

  Loan officers at Community Bank of Manatee said they knew something was seriously awry when borrowers would come in and start to cry. ""These were grown men,"" said Bill Sedgeman, the bank's chairman and founder. ""They'd get very emotional."" 

  Mr. Sedgeman's bank was founded in 1995 and avoided much of the construction lending that hurt its local rivals, he said. 

  Still, Community Bank of Manatee was pinched because it hasn't matched the deposit rates paid by struggling banks trying to keep customers from defecting. ""People wanted us to match, but we need a spread to stay in business,"" he said. 

  Coast, started in 2000, sank more than $100 million -- or one-fourth of its loan portfolio -- into loans related to homes being built by Construction Compliance Inc., based in St. Petersburg, Fla. That exposure was far too big for the bank's size, analysts say. When the real-estate market plummeted, borrowers stopped payments on loans that were underwater. The builder halted construction, leaving cinder-block foundations and empty lots dotting towns south of Sarasota. 

  Five-year-old First Priority Bank reported $39.3 million in problem loans at the end of the first quarter. The bank has installed a new CEO in an effort to strengthen its financial condition. 

  A spokesman said the bank won't rule out selling itself. ""First Priority will explore any opportunity that comes to it regarding ways to solve [its] issues,"" spokesman Frank Knautz said. 

  Also clobbered has been Freedom Bank, which opened in Bradenton in 2005. 

  It posted first-quarter losses of $7.8 million, and nonperforming assets have climbed to more than 8% of its total, according to analysts. 

  ""In looking back . . . loans were being made mostly in the commercial real-estate arena and the development arena, and when that bubble burst, we all had to live with that,"" said David Zuern, who was brought in as CEO in April. 

  To turn the bank around, Mr. Zuern is trying to raise capital and shore up the bank's core deposits. 

  Some analysts say struggling new banks in cities like Bradenton still might turn out to be solid investments if they can weather the current woes. 

  Once the banking industry stabilizes, ""bigger banks outside of the area are going to be looking to, basically, find a bargain,"" predicted Karen Dorway, president and director of research for BauerFinancial Inc., a bank-rating and research firm in Coral Gables, Fla.

334,"UPDATE: ECB Trichet: Determined To Prevent 2nd-Round Effects

  (Adds comments, market reaction.) 

 

   STRASBOURG (Dow Jones)--The European Central Bank will continue to monitor all developments ""very closely"" and its Thursday rate hike will help to fend off second-round inflation effects, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told the European Parliament Wednesday. 

  Trichet said the ""first signs of"" materializing second-round effects were already visible in some of the 15 countries that share the euro currency. He added that in view of this, it was vital to abandon inflation-indexed wage setting schemes. 

  In the German government bond market, the bund yield curve inverted further Wednesday after ECB President Trichet warned of the risk of prolonged high inflation in the euro-zone economy. 

  The comments weighed on the front end of the yield curve, which currently prices in an accommodative ECB stance, BNP Paribas' brokerage said. 

  Trichet said risks to consumer price inflation would ""prevail"" at present and that the rise in the consumer price index is likely to moderate only gradually next year. 

  June inflation accelerated to 4%, according to the Eurostat flash-estimate, and is unlikely to fall back below 3% during the remainder of the year due to surging oil prices. 

  Trichet said such inflation levels were ""worrying."" 

  The ECB raised its key interest rate to 4.25% from 4% Thursday, after keeping it steady since June 2007 despite global market turmoil. 

  ""This action underlines the Governing Council's strong determination to prevent second-round effects and maintain longer-term inflation expectations (are) firmly anchored,"" Trichet said. 

  The ECB fears that rising commodity and oil prices could prompt people to anticipate further gains in inflation, thereby triggering a wage-price spiral. 

  Companies, ranging from producers of intermediate goods to consumer product and car makers, said recently they will raise their prices, due to high oil, energy and steel prices. 

  In turn, some labor unions are likely to increase their pay claims, arguing that high inflation is reducing workers' purchasing power. 

  Trichet said the central bank's rate hike was ""the contribution of the ECB's monetary policy to preserving purchasing power over the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area."" 

  Some E.U. parliamentarians criticized Trichet for not mentioning the negative effects that a higher ECB interest rate will have on economic growth in his speech as the hike curtails access to credit for both firms and households. 

  The chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker, however, defended the ECB's monetary policy, arguing the central bank was acting in accordance with its mandate to preserve price stability.

336,"UPDATE: China Premier Wen: To Accelerate Econ Restructuring

 

  (Adds quotes from Wen; comments by Vice Premier Wang.) 

 

  BEIJING (Dow Jones)--China will accelerate its economic restructuring and boost the competitiveness of its exports as it tries to maintain steady economic growth in the face of new global challenges, Premier Wen Jiabao said. 

  Curbing inflation is a key task, and Beijing will work to rein in inflation to ""levels that are bearable for social and economic development,"" he said on a trip to Shanghai and Jiangsu province in east China. 

  Wen's latest remarks suggest that Beijing realizes that it is getting harder to meet its goal of keeping growth of the consumer price index around 4.8% this year, after surges in global crude-oil prices prompted China to hike domestic retail prices for fuel last month. Wen had acknowledged in March that the CPI target would be hard to meet. 

  The CPI in January-May rose 8.1% from the same period last year, exceeding the 4.8% gain last year. 

  Wen's comments and remarks by other senior officials over the weekend suggest Beijing is unlikely to ease efforts to add more value to China-made export goods, boost domestic consumption and develop its service industries, despite concerns that a U.S. economic slowdown and surging global prices of oil and commodities will hurt Chinese companies. 

  ""We need to accelerate the mode of growth in external trade, improve the structure of imports and exports, and raise the core competitiveness of exports in the market,"" a statement on the central government's Web site cited Wen as saying. Wen was visiting both areas from Friday to Sunday, to learn about the economic situation there. 

  In the past two years, Beijing has cut rebates on export taxes for thousands of products, particularly those whose manufacture requires a lot of energy and emits a lot of pollution. It has restricted exports in the processing trade - where firms import raw materials to make products for duty-free exports. And it has allowed the yuan to rise, encouraging domestic consumption but hurting exports. 

  Echoing the call for a restructuring of Chinese exports, Vice Premier Wang Qishan was reported by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying: ""The model of crude external-trade growth of the past is hard to sustain. We need to ... boost the efficiency of companies and their competitiveness."" 

  Both men encouraged the development of China's service industry, particularly the financial sector. 

  Wen reiterated China's goal of making Shanghai a global financial hub, and said the city should aim to become a shipping hub for northeast Asia. 

  Xinhua cited Wang, responsible for the financial sector, as saying China needs to boost its financial services. 

  ""Preventing risks is the financial sector's eternal main task,"" he said during a visit to the eastern province of Shandong from Thursday to Friday. He urged financial firms to ""pay close attention to all kinds of possible risks and maintain financial security and stability.""

338,"French Fin Min: Doing Everything We Can To Reach Growth Goal

 

  PARIS (Dow Jones)--The French government will do everything it can to reach its economic growth target for 2008, the country's finance minister Christine Lagarde said Thursday. 

  However, Lagarde, in a French radio interview, suggested that external factors, such as a surge in oil prices and inflation in general, had been hurdles to cross. She repeated that she expects inflation in France to cool in the rest of the year. 

  Lagarde didn't elaborate on what new measures the government might undertake to get the stalling economy back up to speed. 

  The official government forecast for growth in gross domestic product this year is 1.7%-2.0%, though Lagarde last month said the French economy should expand by closer to 1.7%. Some private forecasts have foreseen 1.3% growth. 

  But all those forecasts came before news earlier Thursday that France's economy contracted by an unexpected 0.3% in the second quarter. 

  Lagarde also said in the radio interview that this week's government controlled price increases for electricity and gas were inevitable given the huge rise in oil prices this year.

339,"TALES OF THE TAPE: Panera Taking Larger Bite From Sales

 
   By Paul Ziobro 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Baking bread costs more today than it did a year ago, so Panera Bread Co.'s (PNRA) sticking to a simple recipe: Get more cash out of each customer, rather than just more customers. 

  Rising commodities costs and a beleaguered consumer are a toxic mix for most eateries. Panera's no exception. Its upscale baker-cafe chains appeal to customers ranging from moms meeting for a soup and salad lunch to business folk grabbing a Chicken Bacon Dijon panini while tapping away on their laptops. It's a slightly pricier option than fast-food chains like McDonald's, but more upscale, too, playing on ambiance as much as its fresh bakery appeal. 

  Perhaps because of this, Panera has been able to pull off a price rise. It has focused on maximizing profit, wooing customers to higher-margin items, while being smarter about costs like wheat purchases. But the stock's now looking well-baked, particularly as customer traffic is straining. 

  ""In the past we had been focused on the dollars consumers brought into the cafe,"" Panera Chief Executive Ronald Shaich said in a recent earnings call. ""But for the last nine months and going forward, we have been and will be focused on the dollars consumers leave when they walk out of the cafe."" 

  Last month, Panera's second-quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. It even raised its profit goals for the year. Its stock now trades around $53, up more than 40% since the start of the year when it was wallowing at a five-year low. But that makes it pricey, trading on about 23-times forward earnings, though rival Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) is an even loftier 28-times. 

  Sure, price increases have helped keep sales growth positive, but the latest indications show traffic declined in July, meaning the company is losing customers compared with last year. 

  Panera says the dip in traffic is a result of a ""stew"" of other elements, including tough year-ago comparisons. In fact, Shaich said in a recent earnings call that internal surveys have found that consumers still think of Panera, with its focaccia sandwiches, strawberry poppyseed salads and soups in a bread bowl, as a value. And traffic remained up during price increases earlier this year. 

  But even if consumers snub $7 salads, Panera has taken some proactive measures to help keep profits intact. 

  The Richmond Heights, Mo., company refers to these changes as a ""paradigm evolution,"" which came after the chain lost its way in 2007. Following several years of impressive growth and a five-year period in which it more than doubled the number of stores, Panera posted a same-store-sales gain, a closely followed metric, of just 1.7% for fiscal 2007. 

  Panera executives acknowledge taking their eyes off the ball. The company focused on blindly bringing more people to their stores, never mind if they wound up buying lower-margin items. A pizza product called Crispiani floundered. As wheat and oil prices ticked up, sales margins contracted. 

  ""They had decelerating margins but nobody cared because they kept generating enough top-line growth,"" Steve West, restaurant analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said. 

  Panera followed with a redesign of its menu boards to draw the customer's eyes toward meals with higher margins, like the soup-and-salad combo, rather than pricier items that may not bring as much to the bottom line. It also ditched the pizza product and started pricing its specialty bagels like ones infused with asiago cheese or baked with apples, cinnamon and raisins at $1.25, while plain and everything bagels were 99 cents. 

  ""The careful testing and restructuring of the menu board and menu engineering made it easier for people to order higher gross margin items,"" said Bryan Elliot, analyst at Raymond James & Associates. 

  Panera also started to make its wheat purchases at least six months out, as a way to stave off cost volatility due to hyperinflation that has driven costs to $15 a bushel for the current quarter compared with $5.80 a bushel in the prior-year period. 

  The moves helped improve operating margins in the most recent quarter by about 2.7% at company-owned stores in the face of higher ingredient costs. 

  On another flank, Panera hopes to drive more sales during the morning with grilled breakfast sandwiches and is testing combo meals during that time as well. 

  Even as macro pressures weigh on the restaurant space, Panera is viewed among the leaders in the hottest sub-sector among dining chains: fast casual. Alongside other category leader Chipotle, fast-casual chains fall in the middle between fast-food and sit-down restaurants, offering high-quality food with fast service. Such chains are seeing increased traffic as diners ""trade-down"" from casual-dining chains and ""trade-up"" from fast-food restaurants, according to restaurant consultant Technomic Inc. 

  That has caused other restaurant chains to encroach on the space. Subway, for one, has recently started testing an upscale design in the Washington, D.C., market. 

  Panera also has an ideal target audience. Many locations are situated near office environments, targeting workers for their breakfast and lunch options, and other high-income suburban areas. 

  But that doesn't mean that Panera customers won't be immune entirely to the economic pinch, which is why company executives are tempering their growth expectations for next year as inflation, commodity costs and a shaky consumer take a toll. 

  ""The end of the current hyper-inflationary environment and broader economic recession do not appear to be near hand,"" Panera Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Kip said recently.

340,"UPDATE: India Extends Stock Limit On Wheat For Six Months

 

  (Adds details, quote from government official.) 

 

  NEW DELHI (Dow Jones)--India's federal Cabinet is extending temporary measures aimed at curbing wheat and pulse hoarding until next April, a senior government official said Thursday. 

  The government is keeping in place a limit on wheat stocks private traders can hold while extending the restrictions to unmilled rice even as it continues to purchase wheat in record quantities. 

  ""This is expected to help in the effort being taken to tackle the problem of rising prices and improve the availability of these commodities,"" Information and Broadcasting Minister Priyaranjan Dasmunsi told reporters. 

  Stock limits vary from state to state. They had been set to expire by the end of August. 

  The government has also decided to impose limits on unmilled rice (paddy) stocks, because after the imposition the wheat limits, traders began to hoard paddy, Dasmunsi said. 

  Meanwhile, state-run agencies have purchased a record 22.54 million metric tons of wheat since the beginning of the current wheat marketing year, which began April 1. 

  Government agencies bought 11.1 million tons of wheat in 2007-08. The government hiked the minimum intervention price for the grain early this year. This made selling to the government more attractive to farmers and explains higher government procurement in recent months.

  0812 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/PKR ends up at 74.90 vs 74.50 previous close on higher demand from importers. ""The demand surged as importers found it favorable to buy at these levels,"" says dealer. Adds, pair may surpass 75 as ruling government has still not started addressing economic issues, despite President Pervez Musharraf's resignation on Aug. 18. ""Inflows will not come at same speed, hurting the rupee."" (HAZ) 

 

  0810 GMT [Dow Jones] PREVIEW: India WPI-based inflation rate likely 12.63% on year in week to August 9 vs 12.44% previous week, according to median forecast of six economists in Dow Jones poll. ""WPI will increase due to higher prices of vegetables, nonfood articles, sugar, cement, tobacco, and machinery & tools segments,"" says Sonal Varma of Lehman Brothers, who expects inflation rate at 12.59% along with StanChart. MF Global, IDBI Gilts and Yes Bank share estimate at 12.63%, Kotak Securities forecasts 12.68%. RBI looks likely to maintain tight monetary policy stance as inflation remains well above its upwardly revised tolerance level of 7%; data due 1230 GMT Thursday. (ABG) 

  0804 GMT [Dow Jones] TRY is slightly stronger, in line with rebounding global stock markets. USD/TRY now trades at 1.1910 from 1.1950 Tuesday. On the other hand, bonds are still weaker on ongoing high domestic inflation expectations. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark bond trades at 18.67% from 18.51% Tuesday. Initial resistance stands at 1.1850 for TRY, and support is pegged at 18.8% for the benchmark bond. Analysts say the course of EUR/USD and European bourses are important for direction. (IHA) 

  0804 GMT [Dow Jones] EUR/USD recorded a key day reversal Monday, trading either side of the previous day's range and closing above the previous high. However, Bank of Scotland's currency strategist Naeem Wahid says this is not the beginning of a trend higher, instead it probably signals a period of consolidation, or a small upside correction. Wahid adds this correction could be deeper if it occurs with a simultaneous rally in commodities, although with oil unable to break out of its previous 1 week range this seems unlikely. EUR/USD now trades at 1.4760. (GST) 

 

  0803 GMT [Dow Jones] China onshore IRS down on ample liquidity, with 1-year down 2 bps at 3.28%-3.40%, 5-year down 1 bp at 3.71%-3.83%.

  0803 GMT [Dow Jones] The AUD has cashed in on the USD's dip and the spike in commodity prices, including crude oil. This helped it to shrug off a large monthly drop in skilled vacancies and only a meager 0.1% rise in the latest Westpac leading index. But, says Calyon, the RBA is still set to cut rates on Sept. 3 and this will cap any further gains in the currency. (NEH) 

 

  0801 GMT [Dow Jones] KLCI +0.2% at 1071.19 in razor thin volume; rebound in handful of oversold heavyweights, including government-led companies supporting, say dealers.

  0800 GMT [Dow Jones] The BOE August meeting minutes, due 0830 GMT, will be key to UK financial market trends Wednesday, says Kenneth Broux, an economist at Lloyds TSB. With markets now positioned for an interest rate cut later this year, Broux says any change to the three-way split vote (7-1-1) seen in July will determine near-term direction in financial markets. ""We still expect a three-way split but for another MPC member to join the call for lower rates,"" Broux adds. (KJE) 

  0746 GMT [Dow Jones] Gilts open lower Wednesday, pressured by a reversal of Tuesday's safe-haven flows as equity markets recover from Tuesday's sharp declines. Market activity remains subdued ahead of the BOE August meeting minutes, due 0830 GMT. RBS expects the minutes to show the MPC voted 7-1-1 in favor of leaving interest rates at 5.0%, the same split as seen in July.

342,"FOCUS: Bulgarian HICP Dips But Time Is Running Out

 
   By Christopher Emsden 
   OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  Prices in Bulgaria declined in August, a welcome trend for an overheating economy with double-digit inflation. 

  But the 0.1% monthly decline in the harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, still left Bulgaria's annual inflation at 11.8%, far above the central bank's forecast of an 8% rate by the end of the year as well as the government's 6.5% projection. 

  The inflation data were better than expected and the drop in food prices, linked to a rebound in the grain harvest, augurs well for calmer inflation ahead in the region. But the drop may not be fast or strong enough to offset an economic slowdown and the government's plans to spend down its budget surplus ahead of an election next year. 

  ""Only half the price increases are attributable to external factors beyond the control of Bulgarian authorities,"" said UniCredit economist Fabio Mucci. 

  Private-sector credit is booming at a 52% annual rate, wages are rising 25% a year and government expenditure on fuel and other subsidies have shot up more than 50% in the past year. Meanwhile, industrial production is slowing, as is demand in Bulgaria's European export markets. 

  Normally, higher central bank rates would be deployed to control an overheating economy. Romania, where inflation slowed to 8% in August, has a policy rate of 10.25%. But Bulgaria has a currency board that links its currency, the lev, to the euro and strips it of control over interest rates. 

  The central bank hasn't used its other policy tools, such as raising reserve requirements to curtail lending. Meanwhile, fiscal policy has been tight but will now be loosened as the government plans to offer new benefits such as free vacations and heating fuel subsidies for families. 

  Authorities seem to hope declining commodity prices will tame inflation, but it's more likely that will only happen as the economy slows over the next few years, said Mucci. 

  Food prices have declined for four months in a row, and their annual rate of growth in August was only 9.4% on the month, below the headline inflation rate and sharply down from the 24% jump on the year reported as recently as June, according to data from the statistics institute. 

  However, the planned stimulus may lift inflation more than growth, according to Mitko Dimitrov, an economist at the Bulgarian Academy of Science. Hasty short-term handouts are an inefficient use of the budget surplus because their likely aim is to boost current private spending, he said. 

  Cutting income, payroll and corporate taxes would be more effective because it would free resources to be used more productively, said Dimitar Chobanov, an analyst at the Institute of Market Economics in Sofia. 

  Lower oil prices may not offer much solace for Bulgaria, where Bulgargaz, the gas monopoly, this week asked for regulatory approval of 37% price hikes starting next month. The company claims local heating companies are failing to pay their bills, leaving it strapped for cash to import wholesale gas from Russia and build out its network. 

  Bulgargaz subsidies have put its financial stability at risk and cannot go on forever, which means that ""opportunities to cushion the impact of higher international gas prices on the local economy are decreasing,"" said UniCredit's Mucci. 

  Meanwhile, Bulgaria's main growth driver, construction and real estate, is showing signs of stalling. Foreign direct investment in the sector is in decline, which raises doubts about how the country can sustain a current-account deficit of more than 20% of gross domestic product. 

  There's a risk Bulgaria may lose its triple-B rating from Standard & Poor's, according to UniCredit. 

  Those doubts are increasingly evident in financial markets. The Sofix blue-chip index has lost more than 40% this year and is trading at two-year lows. 

  The cost of insuring Bulgarian sovereign debt against default for five years was 222 basis points on Thursday, according to data provider Markit. That's 47 basis points wider than a month ago and a whopping 190 basis points wider than a year ago. 

  ""There is a danger of an economic hard landing in Bulgaria,"" said Calyon strategist Simon Smollett, who expects growth to slow to 4.7% in 2009 from 6.6% this year. 

  The currency board will probably be kept, but it currently isn't helping, he and others noted. 

  With a euro peg, any decrease in capital inflows will automatically lead to the contraction of the local currency in circulation and trigger an abrupt economic crunch, according to Goldman Sachs, which noted that several Baltic states are now flirting with recession after double-digit GDP growth only a year ago. 

  The competitiveness of Bulgaria's lev ""requires a period of inflation below euro-zone inflation levels, which seems unlikely given the government's reluctance to squeeze the economy by increasing the budget surplus,"" Smollett said.

344,"WSJ(9/15) Mitsubishi, Mazda Raise Prices In Japan

   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) 
   By Yoshio Takahashi 

  TOKYO -- Mazda Motor Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said they will raise the prices of some of their vehicles in Japan, despite sluggish domestic sales. 

  Mazda, the Japanese affiliate of Ford Motor Co., said it will raise the prices on four commercial models by 2.8% to 3% beginning Oct. 1, citing costs of raw materials. Mitsubishi will increase prices by 2.9%, on average, for three commercial vehicles that Mazda produces for the company. 

  Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. have also raised prices. Honda Motor Co. is the only one that has resisted. 

  Japanese car makers raised prices in some overseas markets this year as higher prices of steel and other raw materials needed to build cars are squeezing their profitability. However, they had been cautious that Japanese customers wouldn't easily accept price increases as Japanese companies usually raises domestic prices only when they redesign existing models. 

  They are also concerned that price increases could further reduce consumer appetite in the domestic market, where auto sales will likely fall to the lowest level in decades this year. 

  However, Mazda's price increases will likely do little to help its bottom line, as annual sales of those models account for just 2% of its global auto sales. Mitsubishi didn't provide annual sales figures for the three models affected.

345,"Corn, Soybeans Find It Tough To Decouple From Outside Mkts

 
   (This article orginally was published on Friday) 
 

  By Andrew Johnson Jr. 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Bearish macroeconomic factors affecting inflationary markets and commodities in general are making it tough for corn and soybeans to decouple from outside markets despite lingering supply woes. 

  Commodity and inflationary markets have become extremely intertwined in recent years. And the slowing of the U.S. and global economies over the past several months has brought negative effects on prices that have been felt across commodities markets. 

  Outside commodities markets have to some degree become more of a focus than weather of trader attention, with traders watching what is happening in crude oil and the U.S. dollar before checking the weather, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co. 

  Weather is a key factor in the development of crops and is usually the primary influence during the summer growing season. 

  Corn and soybeans have a correlation with crude oil because of the alternative fuels ethanol and biodiesel, and that relationship makes energy an influence for corn and soy on a daily basis, traders said. In the U.S., ethanol is made primarily from corn while biodiesel is typically made from soyoil, which is produced when soybeans are crushed. 

  The slowing U.S and world economies have raised concerns about future export demand, as high prices spark fears of global curbed food demand, Basse said. 

  The grain market continues to look for a strong fundamental clue that will allow corn and soybeans to stand on their own feet, with a reduction in yield and production forecasts the latest feature to try to rescue the market from a recent downturn. 

  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's cut to yields and lowering of production on Friday should give grain and oilseed markets a lift, especially after recent losses, which have been seen across commodities markets. A rallying U.S. dollar and the exodus of index and hedge funds recently have pushed prices down sharply from all-time highs scored in 2008. 

  Futures did settle higher Friday, in part due to the report. Chicago Board of Trade December corn futures settled up the 30-cent, exchange-imposed trading limit at $5.63 1/4 a bushel. November soybeans settled 26 cents higher at $12.02 a bushel. 

  David Hightower, principal and founder of Hightower Report, said the sharp break in grain prices is directly related to the influence of outside markets, rather than prices falling because yields were expected to rise. 

  ""Because of the macroeconomic influences, this data won't be as powerfully bullish as it could be,"" Hightower said. ""But if the stock market stabilizes and crude oil bottoms, we could see inflation concerns coming back."" 

  The market is in a corrective phase from overbought conditions experienced during corn and soybeans' historic run to all-time highs. Simple rationing of supplies have emerged, as once prices got too high, end-users adjusted their buying habits, and the world seemingly is using fewer commodities and producing nations are searching for demand, analysts said. 

  The market is readjusting downward, making it difficult for buyers to fight against a general bearish trend. 

  ""Commodities are cyclical, and we are in a bearish cyclical phase in the market, making it easy to sell-off on bearish news, particularly from outside-market factors,"" said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential Bache Commodities in New York. 

  The U.S. has a very tight domestic supply situation, but the ""U.S. is a bullish island in a bearish sea,"" as global inventories are not scarce, Frick said. 

  The world oilseed market has intrinsic bearish factors, with increased world rapeseed and sunseed production, larger Chinese soy crop prospects and India's soy crop seen up this year, Frick said. 

  The fall of the U.S. dollar over the past few years fueled the commodity boom. And amid the global economic woes, the soybean market seemingly overshot on the high side. That and a recently stronger dollar have opened the door for the current downside correction, analysts said. 

  However, an extremely tight soybean stock situation, with very few supplies in the hands of end-users, will continue to lend support, particularly with uncertainty surrounding 2008 yields. 

  Further yield reductions from USDA will force fundamentals back into the mainstream of market focus, said Dan Cekander, analyst with Newedge. 

  ""If you get U.S. soybean yields down to 39 or 38 bushels an acre, supply would be so tight and fundamentals so bullish, severe supply rationing would be needed and futures could decouple from bearish outside economic factors,"" Cekander added.

346,"MONEY TALKS: UK Economy To Dive With UK Housing

 
   By Alen Mattich 
   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 
 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Something very bad is happening to the U.K. economy. 

  Mortgage market data released this morning show that a mere GBP143 million was lent against houses during August. That represents just 5% of mortgage lending made a month earlier. 

  August's scale of lending would have represented a rounding error in normal times. To put the number into context, it represents lending on little more than 1,000 properties, based on an average house price of around GBP175,000 and 75% mortgages. 

  The scale of the decline might be shocking, but the fact that mortgage lending is falling should surprise no one. Even though house prices have been nose-diving during the past year, they are still far too expensive, both in terms of mortgage service costs and set against household incomes. 

  The average fixed rate mortgage was 5.96% in July - the most recent month for which the Council of Mortgage Lenders provides data. Anecdotally, that's gone up since. An average fixed rate mortgage for an averagely priced house with 25% down currently runs at around 6.3%. 

  In July 2007 it was 5.71%, and a year before that it was 5.12%. 

  At the same time, rising unemployment, rising inflation and static earnings means that even with house prices falling at between 10% and 15% on the year (depending on which index you look at), affordability is going down. 

  Buyers are also reluctant to commit to the market because they expect further price falls. To get back to historic price-earnings ratios, U.K. house prices would need to drop another 30% to 40% - never mind overshooting to the downside. 

  Prospective buyers often depending on sales of their own houses to raise finance, creating housing chains. These chains have become ever more fragile as participants get cold feet, as their approved mortgages expire, or as they withdraw from sales after buyers suddenly drop their offer prices. Hometrack, a housing research firm, expects this year to be the worst for property market turnover since the 1960s. 

  Now, the housing market's problems might not matter for the wider economy - for everyone who loses out from house price falls, there's someone who gains - were it not for the U.K. economy's dependence on debt. U.K. household debt is only just short of 180% of GDP, up from just over 100% during the late 1990s. The current debt level is the highest of any developed country. Ever. 

  Mortgage equity withdrawal was a massive driver of growth during the past decade. Without it, the economy will have considerably less oomph. 

  What's more, it won't come back. The disaster in the financial markets and the collapse of two big mortgage lenders - Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley - as well as consolidation elsewhere in the industry - Santander's recent acquisition of Alliance & Leicester; Lloyds' takeover of HBOS; and the disappearance of a couple of smaller building societies - suggests considerably less competition between lenders in future. The era of 115% mortgages is dead. Banks will require buyers to put more of their own money into the deal, which will require savings rates to go up. Bigger deposits mean lower house prices, mean lower overall lending. 

  Whatever rescues are orchestrated by governments, be they nationalizations like B&B and Northern Rock or massive programs like the U.S.'s $700 billion plan, the fact is that there will be less lending in future. 

  Economies, particularly the U.K.'s, will have to adapt.

348,"PREVIEW:Indonesia Sep CPI Likely +11.99% On Yr, +0.81% On Mo

 

  (This article was originally published Monday, Sept. 29.) 

 

  By Reuben Carder 

  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 

  JAKARTA (Dow Jones)--Indonesia's inflation likely sped up slightly in September due to higher fuel costs ahead of a major Islamic holiday, but inflation may have peaked last month, economists said. 

  A Dow Jones Newswires poll of 10 regional economists yielded a median forecast of an 11.99% on-year rise in the consumer price index and a 0.81% increase on month. 

  The CPI rose 11.85% on year and 0.51% on month in August. The Central Statistics Agency will release official inflation data Monday around 0630 GMT. 

  The Islamic fasting month of Ramadan ended last week and millions of people in Muslim-majority Indonesia had traveled extensively within the country and enjoyed lavish feasts to celebrate Idul Fitri or Eid-al-Fitr, the festivity that concludes the Ramadan month. 

  But the economists said food price controls and an ample supply of commodities may help keep a lid on festivity-related inflation this year, despite likely higher household fuel consumption coinciding with an increase in prices of kerosene and liquefied natural gas. 

  ""Inflation likely stayed elevated largely due to more pronounced passthrough effects from the fuel price hike in May and the hike in retail LPG prices in both early July (by 23.5%) and late August (by 9.5%),"" Citi economist Leon Hiew said. 

  Hiew added that ""inflation has peaked (in September) but would remain stubborn in coming off given persistent inflationary momentum from previous months."" 

  The economists said a 20% increase in transport costs in July - after the government hiked gasoline and diesel prices by almost 29% in May - presents an inflation risk especially as transport usage spikes due to Idul Fitri.

349,"DATA SNAP: Vietnam Oct CPI Eases,On-Mo Lowest Since Mar &apos;07

 

  HANOI (Dow Jones)--Vietnam's inflation rate eased in October as the cost of fuel, food and construction materials fell from the previous month, indicating that the country's rampant inflation has peaked. 

  The consumer price index rose 26.72% from a year earlier in October after rising 27.9% in September, the Government Statistics Office said in a statement released Saturday. 

  Vietnam usually issues economic data based on estimates before the end of the reporting period. 

  The month-to-month rate of inflation will ease 0.19% in October, marking its smallest increase since March 2007. The CPI rose 0.2% in September from the previous month after rising 1.6% in August from July. 

  The government lowered retail diesel prices by a total 8.8% so far this month, following a decline in global crude oil prices. 

  The CPI rose 23.15% in the first 10 months of the year, the GSO said. 

  Food and food services prices are projected to have risen 40.6% from a year earlier and to be down 0.4% from the previous month. 

  Rice and other cereal prices are projected to have risen 60% from a year earlier and decreased 1.9% from September. 

  Housing and construction materials costs are estimated to have increased 22.8% from a year earlier and fallen 1.1% from September. 

  The statistics office said the U.S. dollar has risen 2.46% against the Vietnamese dong since October last year. The central bank Saturday set the dollar value at VND16,518.

352,"UPDATE: Oct Mtg Minutes Signal Fed Open To More Rate Cuts

  (Updates to note Fed officials' concern about whether future cuts could be effective and background on economic events.) 

  By Maya Jackson Randall 

   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Given new expectations that the U.S. economy could contract for as much as a year, Federal Reserve officials stand ready to slash interest rates to levels not seen in half a century, minutes of their most recent policy meeting show. 

  At the same time, some officials voiced concern that future cuts might do little to put the ailing economy on a healthier path, according to the minutes, which were released Wednesday after the customary three-week lag. And with the target federal funds rate already at 1%, some officials pointed out that the Fed has ""limited room"" to lower further and should therefore move slowly. 

  ""Some members were concerned that the effectiveness of cuts in the target federal funds rate may have been diminished by the financial dislocations, suggesting that further policy action might have limited efficacy in promoting a recovery in economic growth,"" said the minutes. 

  Additionally, officials suggested that the U.S. economy could be in for a rather lengthy recession and downgraded their economic forecasts. The minutes show that officials generally expect the economy to contract in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009. And some officials expect that the economic weakness ""could persist for some time."" 

  Officials made clear in their Oct. 28-29 meeting that ""unfolding economic developments"" could require the Federal Open Market Committee ""to further lower its target for the federal funds rate in the future and to review the adequacy of its liquidity facilities."" 

  Fed officials said they anticipate that economic data would show ""significant weakness in economic activity"" and that additional policy easing could well be necessary, according to the meeting minutes. 

  Meanwhile, they said they expect inflation to diminish in coming quarters. 

  ""In any event, the committee agreed that it would take whatever steps were necessary to support the recovery of the economy,"" the minutes said. 

  Overall, officials found that risks to the economy had greatly escalated and the credit crisis had morphed into an ""international phenomenon,"" leaving them little choice but to cut interest rates to four-year lows. 

  As the credit crisis worsened last month, the FOMC voted unanimously Oct. 29 to lower the target federal-funds rate at which banks lend to each other by 0.5 percentage point to 1%, its lowest level since the period between June 2003 and June 2004. The decision came in wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s (LEHMQ) September collapse, the near-failure of insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG) and new concerns about the conditions of other financial firms. 

  The Fed officials agreed that ""significant easing in policy was warranted at this meeting in view of the marked deterioration in the economic outlook and anticipated reduction in inflation pressures,"" the minutes said. 

  They also noted that the credit crisis expanded globally since their September policy meeting, at which they held rates steady. 

  ""The strains from the banking and credit crisis intensified and took on a more global aspect over the intermeeting period,"" the minutes said. ""This development and the related erosion of the economic outlook and reduction in inflationary pressures led many central banks to reduce their policy rates, including in the internationally coordinated action announced on Oct. 8."" That day, Fed officials agreed to an unprecedented joint rate cut with other major central banks including the European Central Bank and Bank of England. 

  Meanwhile, the Fed downgraded its 2008 forecasts for gross domestic product and the unemployment rate, according to a quarterly forecast the Fed released Wednesday. 

  The central tendency of officials' forecast is for gross domestic product growth this year to stand between 0.0% and 0.3%, which is lower than its June projection of a 1.0% to 1.6% range. 

  Meanwhile, they slashed their GDP growth projection for 2009 to a range of -0.2% to 1.1%. In June, they had seen a 2.0% to 2.8% range for 2009. 

  Officials also raised their forecasts for the unemployment rate. They now see the unemployment rate between 6.3% and 6.5% in 2008, up from the previous forecast of 5.5% to 5.7%, the Fed said. 

  Amid a deteriorating economy, the unemployment rate had already surpassed the Fed's previous forecast. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate in October soared 0.4 percentage point to 6.5%, the highest level since March 1994.

353,"UPDATE:India WPI Eases Further, RBI Likely To Cut Rates Soon

 

  (Recasts lede, adds economists' comments and background on the central bank's rate cuts) 

 

  NEW DELHI (Dow Jones)--India's inflation rate was 8.90% in the week ended Nov. 8, staying in single digits for the second successive week for the first time since May, and increasing the likelihood that the central bank may soon soften its key interest rates. 

  The inflation rate, measured by the Wholesale Price Index, was lower than 8.98% in the previous week, and the 8.99% median estimate of eight analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires. 

  ""This is the right time for the Reserve Bank of India to cut key interest rates to avoid the economy from facing deflationary pressure,"" N. R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the Institute of Economic Growth, said. ""Inflation is clearly trending down and we expect it to touch 7% by March end."" 

  The index fell 0.2% to 235.0 from 235.5 a week earlier, primarily due to the lower prices of manufactured products, data issued earlier Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry showed. 

  The fuel products index fell 0.9% from a week earlier, dragged by a 4% on-week fall in naphtha prices and a 5% drop in jet-fuel prices. 

  The index, which measures producer prices, is used as a proxy for inflation, as the government reports wholesale price data more quickly and comprehensively than consumer price data. 

  The Reserve Bank of India has targeted an inflation rate of 7% in the current fiscal year that ends March 2009. 

  Since the beginning of October, the central bank has slashed the repurchase rate by 150 basis points to 7.5% and cut the amount of deposits banks have to set aside with it as cash by 350 basis points to 5.5% to boost declining industrial output and slowing growth. 

  According to the latest available data, industrial output expanded 4.8% from a year earlier in September, faster than an expansion of 1.4% in August, but economists expect growth to be muted in the coming months as credit dries up. 

  ""Sagging growth has really become a concern and the central bank would look to cut rates to stimulate the economy,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, Bank of Baroda's chief economist. 

  She expects the RBI to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points and cut the reverse repo rate by 100 basis points by the middle of December.

355,"Key US Dollar Libor Edges Higher, Month End Pressures Cited

 
   By Keith Jenkins 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The cost of borrowing longer-term U.S. dollars in the interbank market rose Friday as banks' funding requirements increased over the month end. 

  Analysts at BNP Paribas noted the last day of the month also corresponded with the last day of the year for many U.S. financial institutions, adding to the funding pressure. 

  The heightened need for funds drove the overnight rate above the Federal Reserve's Fed funds target rate of 1.00%. 

  According to data from the British Bankers' Association, three-month U.S. dollar Libor rose to 2.21688% from Thursday's fixing of 2.2025%. The rate based at 2.1325% on Nov. 12, having peaked at 4.81875% on Oct. 10. 

  The one-month Libor rate edged up to 1.90125% from Thursday's 1.90%. And the overnight rate climbed to 1.1625%, up sharply from Wednesday's 0.9875%. There was no fixing for the overnight rate Thursday because of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. 

  The three-month BOR/OIS spread, a gauge of stress in the money markets, pushed out to 180.9 basis points from around 176bps Thursday. 

  The spread has narrowed from its widest level of 366bps, seen on Oct. 10 when interbank market tensions peaked. 

  Elsewhere, expectations of further interest rate reductions by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, which meets next week, were reinforced by weaker-than-anticipated retail sales data from the Confederation of British Industry. 

  Three-month sterling Libor fixed lower at 3.91% from Thursday's 3.93125%, while the one-month rate dropped to 3.2625% from 3.2875%. 

  The three-month rate has fallen to its lowest since Oct. '03, having peaked at 6.3075% on Oct. 1. 

  However, overnight sterling Libor edged higher to 3.0125% from Thursday's 3.00% as month-end funding pressures rose, creeping above the BOE's Bank Rate, currently 3.00%. 

  According to Sonia rates, the Bank Rate is expected to fall to around 2.00% on Dec. 4 and to decline to 1.50% by the February MPC meeting. 

  Euro Libor fixings fell Friday after weaker-than-anticipated inflation data underpinned market expectations of a minimum 50bps rate cut by the ECB next week. 

  The key three-month rate fell to 3.85125% from Thursday's fixing of 3.87375%, while the one-month dropped to 3.566625% from 3.58%. Analysts at UniCredit said Thursday's spike higher was due to the ""turn-of-the-year effect"", and should not be read as a worsening of tensions in the interbank market. 

  Meanwhile, the overnight rate rose to 2.94375% from Thursday's 2.90375%, but held below the European Central Bank's refinancing rate, currently 3.25%. 

  The Eonia market remained split between a 50bps and 75bps rate cut by the ECB on Dec. 4.

356,"Michelin Ups Agricultural Tire Prices By 11% In N America

  PARIS (Dow Jones)--Tire maker Cie Generale des Etablissements Michelin (12126.FR) said Monday its North American unit is raising the prices of its Michelin and Kleber brand agricultural tires sold in North America by 11% on average as from Dec. 1. 

  The company. the world's second-largest tire producer by volume, has been increasing its tire prices worldwide in bid to offset the rising cost of raw materials used in their manufacture. 

  Raw material prices have headed lower in recent weeks and months, but Michelin has said it won't feel the full benefit until the first quarter of 2009 because of the lead time between purchasing raw materials and making the revenue from tire sales.

357,"2nd UPDATE: Rosneft 3Q Net Pft Soars; Secures State Credit

 

  (Recasts, adds analyst comment, debt situation.) 

 
   By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  MOSCOW (Dow Jones)--Russia's biggest oil producer OAO Rosneft (ROSN.RS) said Monday its third quarter net profit soared, but that it since then had turned to state banks for short-term borrowings. 

  State-controlled Rosneft said net income reached $3.47 billion from $1.93 billion in the third quarter of 2007, helped by high crude and oil products prices, healthy refining margins and a one-off foreign exchange gain. 

  That figure was well above a Dow Jones Newswires poll of six analysts estimates, which had predicted $2.88 billion.      Although oil prices averaged $113 a barrel in the third quarter - almost 2.5 times higher than current levels - Rosneft is well prepared for what is now ""a more challenging operating environment of substantially lower prices,"" the company's Chief Executive Sergei Bogdanchikov said. 

  Russian oil firms in recent weeks have trimmed billions of dollars in capital expenditure originally earmarked for 2009, but Rosneft remains the sole Russian oil major to stick to its investment plans for next year. 

  The downward revisions have resulted in part from the sudden drop in global oil prices, which this month dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in almost two years as a result of weaker demand in Europe, Russia's main export market. 

  ""The quality of Rosneft's projects are very high, so it would actually make sense for them to keep investing, even if the oil price stays low,"" said Pavel Kushnir, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Moscow. 

  Rosneft is planning to launch its key Vankor field in Eastern Siberia by mid-2009. Production is expected to peak at 25.5 million tons of crude a year, or more than half a million barrels a day. 

  Last year, the company borrowed $22 billion to buy key assets from now-bankrupt Yukos, formerly Russia's biggest oil producer. 

  Rosneft said that by Sept. 30 its total loans and borrowings stood at $20.8 billion, of which $8.4 billion was short-term debt. 

  As the global financial crisis has worsened, the Russian government, which relies heavily on oil export duties for federal budget revenues, has moved to support the industry through the possibility of loans. 

  Rosneft said that since the end of the third quarter, it had obtained $4.6 billion in short-term debt - of which $3.8 billion was nominated in rubles - from state-controlled banks. 

  Despite almost unchanged production levels, revenue was up 51% on the year to $20.69 billion from $13.74 billion, thanks to higher crude prices for the period. 

  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization reached $5.33 billion, up from $4.05 billion, as Rosneft ramped up output of higher-margin petroleum products through both organic growth and acquisitions the previous year. 

  Rosneft shares are well off their mid-May highs, hit most recently by a decline in oil prices and a selloff in Russian equities. 

  At 1710 GMT, they were trading down 13.6% at $3.4 each in London, around 60% lower since January.

359,"Barron&apos;s(12/22) How to Play a &quot;Take-No-Prisoners&quot; Market

   (From BARRON'S) 
   By Lawrence C. Strauss 

  Interview with Rob Arnott 

  Founder and Chairman, Research Affiliates 

 

  Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of asset manager Research Affiliates in Newport Beach, Calif., is one of the big thinkers in finance today. 

  A former editor of the prestigious Financial Analysts Journal, Arnott, 54, has developed expertise in asset allocation, indexing, and pension funds, among other topics. He's a fierce proponent of fundamental indexing -- in which metrics such as aggregate sales and cash flow are used to weight companies in an index, as opposed to market capitalization. 

  With the markets in tatters, Barron's turned last week to Arnott, who in a wide-ranging conversation had plenty to say about fundamental indexing and many other subjects. ""This is not a time to shy away from taking risks,"" says Arnott, who maintains that the market's upheaval has created great investment opportunities, including value stocks and convertible bonds. ""The markets are priced right now to reward risk-bearing more than any time in many, many years,"" he says. Hence, he sees Treasuries, which had a relatively strong '08, as the worst place to put money next year. 

  While the fundamental index Arnott uses smartly outran the Standard & Poor's 500 from 2000 to 2006, it underperformed the S&P in '07 by three percentage points and is behind in '08, as value stocks got shellacked. Yet Arnott's faith in the approach remains unshaken. To find out why, please read on: 

 

  Barron's: What are your thoughts on this year's dismal market? 

  Arnott: What we've seen is the consequence of reckless indebtedness. Subprime was the tip of the iceberg. I found it interesting that folks in government were dismissive of subprime as being not a terribly important issue as recently as late 2007 and even early this year. There's been this pattern of aggregate indebtedness at the corporate level, at the household level and at the government level. It's dismissive of the need to pay things back. As a result, when things started to go sour on some of this debt, beginning with subprime, the cascading effect was beyond what most people could have anticipated. I was a bear coming into this credit crunch, and I actually was labeled a perma-bear. And yet this contagion effect went a lot further than I would have predicted, and there are very few observers who expected anything this severe. But the seeds of it were sown quite aggressively over the last decade. 

 

  Barron's: How did all of that fall into place? 

  Arnott: The indebtedness of the United States rose from five times [gross domestic product] to eight times GDP in 10 years. That is reckless, but that's what has been going on. That sowed the seeds for what we have seen. The deleveraging that has taken place has cascading effects that can come from a lot of different directions and can afflict a lot of different markets. 

  What we saw in September and October was a take-no-prisoners market in which everything outside of Treasuries was savaged. Finally in November, we saw the beginnings of a rationalization where some markets did begin to recover -- but some markets had been hit beyond any rational valuation of the risks associated with those assets. 

 

  Barron's: What should investors be doing differently in the wake of this huge market downturn? 

  Arnott: As shown by the collapse of Bernard Madoff's firm, investors should act with due diligence -- that is, they should be more alert to the risks. We have had a cult of equities develop over the last 20 years in which equities were seen more as the low-risk asset, even the risk-fee asset for those who had a long-term orientation, and that is foolishness. If you are bearing risk, you should get paid for it. If you are picking up nickels in front of a steamroller, trying to identify opportunities to add one-tenth of a percent to your return by taking risks that could cost a 100 times that, that doesn't make sense. People need to be more disciplined about that. That includes individuals, corporations, and banks. 

 

  Barron's: In light of what's happened this year, what's the best way to approach asset allocation? 

  Arnott: Almost everybody, retail investors and institutional investors alike, invests with their eyes in the rearview mirror, favoring what has worked best in the past. But there is a very powerful pattern of mean-reversion in the markets. What has done spectacularly well often takes a rest or it takes a bear market to get back to normal. So the notion of looking at markets and asking what has been hit really hard and, as a consequence, may be priced at really attractive levels is alien to most investors. That goes for your readers, and it goes nearly as much for highly sophisticated institutional investors. This temptation to buy what has done well is the single greatest pitfall in investing, and it is the single reason that a disciplined approach to asset allocation can actually work very, very well. 

 

  Barron's: What's an example of a promising area hit hard? 

  Arnott: The average convertible-arbitrage hedge fund was down about 50% year-to-date at the end of last week. But that result for a long-short absolute-return, fully hedged strategy makes no sense. The temptation is to get out, which is what a lot of investors are doing. The other way to look at it is that the forced liquidations of these hedge-fund positions create new opportunities, namely convertible debt priced at extraordinarily attractive yields. The same thing holds true for emerging market stocks and bonds, along with TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities]. 

  A year ago, folks were probably getting tired of hearing me say there is no low-hanging fruit and that there are no attractively priced markets, both relative to other markets and relative to their own history. I also was saying not to expect double-digit returns and to take risk off the table. 

 

  Barron's: What's your view now? 

  Arnott: It's pretty much the opposite; this is the richest environment of low-hanging fruit I've seen in my career. And you would have to go back to 1973, 1974 or even, in some markets, to the Great Depression to find markets priced as attractively as now. This is not a time to be hunkering down in the safety and comfort of the Treasury curve. There are tremendous opportunities right now. It is so tempting in a bear market to focus on the glass being half-empty and on how much has been lost. But the glass being half full side is largely ignored. 

 

  Barron's: What kind of an asset-allocation mix makes sense to you? 

  Arnott: First of all, most investors think that putting some money in growth stocks, some money in value stocks and some money in international stocks is a well-diversified portfolio. It's not. Diversification means taking on risk in markets that are uncorrelated and that can go up when other markets go down. So a well-diversified portfolio should look at multiple sources of risk, not just in stocks. 

 

  Barron's: Where do you see opportunities? 

  Arnott: A year from now, investors in convertible bonds are likely to be very pleased with what they [see] in terms of prices and yields. The same holds for emerging-market debt denominated in the local currency, which I prefer to dollar-denominated debt. You get a premium yield for emerging-market debt and an additional premium for investing in the local currency. Tacitly, that's a dollar bet, but I don't see how the dollar can do well on a long-term basis when we have indebtedness that is eight times our national income. Imagine an individual going to a bank and saying, ""I owe eight times my income and I would like to borrow more."" The reaction would be immediate and drastic: ""Give us your credit cards; we will slice them up."" But as a nation we still have our credit cards, and we are still using them aggressively. 

 

  Barron's: What other kinds of investments look good to you in terms of asset allocation? 

  Arnott: I also like TIPS. How can we get out of this current mess without renewed inflation? A lot of folks are deeply concerned about the risk of deflation. The temptation is to look at history, especially the Great Depression, which was a deflationary depression and which started with very, very low national indebtedness. If you have very little debt and you have a depression, it is likely to be deflationary. If you have very high debt and you have a depression, it is likely to be massively inflationary. The contrast with Germany in the 1920s is noteworthy; they had massive indebtedness and hyperinflation. I'm not suggesting a risk of hyperinflation. But I am suggesting that people are too glib about tossing aside the risk of inflation, which was front and center less than six months ago for most investors. 

 

  Barron's: What's your sense of opportunities in value stocks versus growth stocks? 

  Arnott: When you look at price-to-book values, the spread between growth stocks and value stocks was at its narrowest ever, just two years ago; now, it's the widest spread ever with the sole exception of the bubble year, in 2000, and we saw what happened after that: seven years in which value drastically and reliably outperformed growth. We could see something similar [now], whereby value sharply outperforms growth. The value side of the market, like much of the bond market, is priced for a depression. The growth side of the market is priced for recession.

   TPM rate history (annual percent): 
    Dec    Nov    Oct    Sep    Aug    Jul    Jun    May 
   8.25%  8.25%  8.25%  8.25%  7.75%  7.25%  6.75%  6.25% 
 
   By Carolina Pica 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 

  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--The Chilean central bank Thursday held the key TPM interest rate steady at 8.25%, in line with analysts' consensus. 

  This was the third consecutive month the central bank opted to leave the TPM at its highest nominal level since the bank switched to a nominal monetary-policy rate in August 2001. 

  ""This decision is line with the recently revised base scenario in the four-month Monetary Policy Report, due to the significant change seen in the global economy and its impact on projected inflation,"" the bank said in a statement. 

  The monetary authority also said it would likely begin a rate-easing process in coming months, but that the pace of this process ""will depend on the inflation outlook."" 

  The central bank acknowledged that inflation in November fell on lower fuel prices but that core inflation remains high. 

  Chile's consumer price index fell 0.1% in November, government statistics agency INE said last week, mostly on a significant drop in the price of unleaded fuel, a heavily weighted component in the CPI. This brought annual inflation down to 8.9% from a 14-year high of 9.9% the previous month. Despite the drop, annual inflation is still running well above the central bank's target of 3%, plus or minus one percentage point. 

  While headline inflation fell, core inflation, which factors out volatile fuel and produce prices, rose to an annualized 9.5% from 9.3%. 

  On the domestic front, the central bank said unemployment levels remain stable and local credit markets are tight. It added economic activity is showing signs of deceleration, while domestic demand, especially for imported goods, is lower than expected. 

  Regarding the international economy, the central bank said access to credit is still ""showing tension, and the most recent data available confirms a significant deceleration in the global economy."" 

  The bank noted that commodities prices, especially copper and crude-oil prices, have continued to drop. 

  The monetary authority reiterated its commitment to managing monetary policy so as to bring inflation back down to its target of 3% in its 24-month policy horizon.

362,"The Stock Market Had a Better Day Than it Seemed. Thank Fiscal Stimulus. -- Barrons.com

By Jacob Sonenshine 

     The three major U.S. stock indexes were mixed Thursday, but beneath the surface, there was strength in the market. 

     The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68.95 points, or 0.22%, to close at 30,991.52. The S&P 500 slid 14.30 points, or 0.38%, to end at 3,795.54, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.31 points, or 0.12%, to close at 13,112.64. The biggest gainer in the S&P 500 was petroleum refiner HollyFrontier (ticker: HFC), with an 11% stock surge. 

     President-elect Joe Biden is expected to speak in the evening in detail about fiscal stimulus. Trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus have already shored up consumers' savings, and a few trillion dollars more would add to the pent-up demand that could be unleashed when Covid-19 vaccines are widely distributed. 

     Investors remain upbeat about the trajectory of the economy. While the major indexes were down, stocks most sensitive to perceived changes in the economy, such as value and small-caps, were up. The market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 was dragged lower by megacap tech stocks including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), which fell 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. 

     But the Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index Fund ETF (VOOV) rose 0.37%. The Russell 2000, an index of small-caps, rose 2%. Small-caps are not only expected to see roughly twice the earnings rebound than large caps will see in 2021, but the smaller names also still trade at a valuation discount to larger ones, giving small-caps even more upside potential. 

     The average Russell 2000 component stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple roughly in line with the average stock on the Russell 1000, which includes some S&P 500 stocks, according to figures from UBS Wealth Management. Historically, the average Russell 2000 forward P/E multiple has a slight premium to that of the Russell 1000, suggesting that there's some upside for the smaller caps of the former. 

     ""I am far more pleased to be holding an overweight in small-caps right now,"" Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, told Barron's. 

     Another signal of optimism on the economy: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which reflects how broadly -- across sectors -- stocks rallied, rose 0.36%. 

     Investors are seeing ""more of the commitment to stimulus and the magnitude of stimulus that will be introduced and most likely passed and the fact that it seems to have bipartisan support,"" Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, told Barron's. 

     A report from Evercore strategists noted the reasons Treasury yields rose was because there are reports that Biden's stimulus plan could total $2 trillion, higher than some calls of late for $1 trillion. Rising treasury yields usually reflect rising inflation and economic expectations. 

     Negatively, initial jobless claims came in worse than expected, although investors shrugged that off. Claims came in at 965,000 for last week, larger than the consensus average for 800,000, and larger than the previous week's revised tally of 784,000, as lockdowns persisted. 

     ""At a certain point tough jobs numbers like we saw this morning can serve as the tinder for those calling for a correction, but the market's view seems to be that the light at the end of the tunnel remains in sight, despite a plodding vaccination rollout."" Mike Loewengart, head of investment strategy at E*Trade, wrote in emailed remarks to the media.

363,"EUROPEAN MIDDAY BRIEFING: Stocks Fall as Biden&apos;s Stimulus Plan Fails to Cheer

  MARKET WRAPS 

  Stocks: 

  European stocks fell on Friday, alongside U.S. stock futures, as the announcement of a highly anticipated stimulus plan from President-elect Joe Biden failed to cheer investors, who remain concerned over climbing COVID-19 cases on both sides of the Atlantic. 

  The Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.4% in a week that has seen it drop around 0.2%. The German DAX fell 0.4%, the French CAC dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 traded 0.6% lower as well. 

  France will impose a nationwide 6 p.m. curfew on Saturday, with initial plans for 15 days to battle climbing cases. Spain reported 38,869 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, the highest on record and three times the worst level seen in the first wave with hospitalizations rising. 

  ""There is renewed enthusiasm about the U.S. due to the prospects for more stimulus and the new administration's pledge to focus on the vaccinations' rollout. Meanwhile, Europe recovery is throttled by additional lockdowns and a fumbled vaccine rollout program,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at Axi, in a note to clients. 

  The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics reported that the country's economy shrank 2.6% in November, after six straight months of growth since lockdowns in the spring. But that was less than the 4% drop forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. 

  Among stocks on the move, shares of technology names were lower 

  Shares of SAP climbed over 2%, after the German software giant pre-announced fourth-quarter results, reporting a sequential improvement ""even as the COVID-19 crisis persisted and lockdowns were reintroduced in many regions."" 

  Carrefour's shares were again on the decline, dropping 3% after the French government voiced objections to prospects of a takeover for the supermarket owner when it and Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard announced early-stage talks earlier in the week. 

  U.S. Markets: 

  Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, indicating the benchmark index may decline for a second day. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq-100 edged less than 0.1% lower and those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%. 

  The S&P 500 is on track to end the week lower, erasing some of the gains made in early January when the gauge rallied to a record high. Markets have for weeks cheered Democrats' plans to expand government spending and bolster the economic rebound. But the size of Mr. Biden's plans, laid out late Thursday, served to check some of that optimism. 

  ""The magnitude obviously was surprising on the upside,"" said Wei Li, head of investment strategy for BlackRock's exchange-traded fund and index investments for Europe, Middle East and Africa. ""With the Senate majority, [taxes] could be coming in the medium term and that is something the market has to assess as well."" 

  Investors are hoping that additional spending will help steer the U.S. economy through a winter that has seen high Covid-19 infection rates and worsening economic data. Figures released Thursday showed that the number of workers filing for jobless benefits posted its biggest weekly gain since the pandemic hit last March. 

  ""When you see data this bad, you have to question if the prevailing expectation-for cyclical recovery to come through-if that would be shaken,"" Ms. Li said. 

  Data on U.S. retail sales in December, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, will offer more insight into the strength of consumer spending and the severity of the broader economic slowdown at the end of the year. 

  Investors will also get an indication of how confident American households are when the University of Michigan releases preliminary January figures for its consumer sentiment index at 10 a.m. ET. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 

  Despite days that see a pullback in markets, investors still expect that the additional fiscal stimulus will support a rally in stocks this year. 

  ""Ultimately, you can't expect equities to go up every day in a straight line,"" said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""The numbers are really quite incredible and I think it is going to all add up to a boom in growth once the vaccines are rolled out."" 

  Ahead of the opening bell, major U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report quarterly earnings starting at about 6:45 a.m. ET. Much of the focus is likely to be on the banks' forecasts for 2021. 

  Forex: 

  The dollar may strengthen further in tandem with U.S. government bond yields after President-elect Joe Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Thursday but the gains won't last, Commerzbank said. 

  EUR/USD levels below 1.20 seem ""quite justified"" over coming months as the stimulus will support the U.S. economy, lifting yields and the dollar, Commerzbank's Esther Reichelt said. 

  However, EUR/USD should rise slowly over the medium-term as the ""continued and significant overvaluation"" of the dollar is no longer justified due to the Federal Reserve's promise to only consider an interest rate rise once full employment is achieved and inflation exceeds 2% for some time, she said. 

  EUR/USD fell 0.1% and the dollar index roses 0.2%. 

  The pound fell in early trade, turning lower after hitting an eight-week high against the euro on Thursday and showing little reaction after data showed U.K. gross domestic product shrank less than expected in November. 

  The figures can largely be ignored due to their stale nature, FX firm Caxton said. 

  The economy contracted 2.6% in November, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, following six consecutive months of growth, but the contraction was much less severe than the 4.0% drop forecast in a Wall Street Journal poll. 

  In addition, the U.K. trade deficit was wider than forecast for November. GBP/USD fell 0.2%, while EUR/GBP edged slightly higher. 

  Bonds: 

  In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked lower to 1.109%, from 1.128% Thursday. 

  Commodities: 

  Brent crude oil was down 1.1% and WTI futures were down 0.8% on a combination of bearish headlines. 

  OPEC said Thursday it expects global demand this year to undershoot pre-coronavirus levels, with rising infection numbers and lockdown measures continuing to stymie an economic recovery in many countries. 

  Meanwhile, the highest number of new Covid-19 cases in 10 months in China --whose oil demand has proven resilient in recent months-- is also giving investors cause for concern according to CMC Markets's David Madden. 

  That news is counteracting comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell about interest rates being kept low, which weighed on the dollar and boosted oil Thursday. 

  Gold was unchanged despite President-elect Joe Biden's plans for a near-$2-trillion stimulus package. Futures were flat at $1,851.90 a troy ounce. 

  Overnight, gold moved in the opposite direction to Treasury yields, which initially rose before easing back. 

  The limited response of both yields and gold to Biden's plans could suggest investors are doubting how much of it will be acceptable to the U.S. Senate, said Jeffrey Halley at Oanda. 

  The Democrats have a razor-thin Senate majority, but not all parts of Biden's plans can be passed by a simple majority--some will require bipartisan support, he said. 

  ""Given the distaste Republicans have for state aid, Mr. Biden's bipartisan hopes will be immediately tested,"" said Halley.

364,"Suppliers Struggle to Keep Up With Output -- WSJ

By Bob Tita | Photographs by Nolis Anderson for The Wall Street Journal 

  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (January 25, 2021). 

     A quicker-than-expected recovery in U.S. manufacturing is resulting in supply disruptions and higher costs for materials used in everything from kitchen cabinets to washing machines to automobiles. 

     Consumers unable to spend on vacations, dining out and concerts instead have opened their wallets for appliances and other improvements to their current or new homes. Car sales also rebounded faster than expected in the second half of 2020. As a result, prices for some industrial commodities used in those products, such as steel and copper, have climbed to their highest levels in years. 

     The increased demand for these materials is showing up in manufacturers' supply chains, which are clogged with orders, causing some producers to add weekend hours and overtime for employees. Orders that took a week or two to fill during the summer now require six to eight weeks, according to manufacturers coping with extended wait times for essential supplies. 

     ""The lack of availability is what kills you,"" said Mark Verhein, president of Church Metal Spinning Co., a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of steel parts for large industrial engines. ""If you can't get the material, that's vexing."" 

     When many factories shut down for more than a month last spring to contain the spread of the coronavirus, production of industrial commodities dropped off as well. Inventories evaporated, and suppliers were wary about ramping up production during what was expected to be a slow recovery for manufacturing in a U.S. economy that had entered into a recession in February. But demand for durable goods such as automobiles and appliances picked up in late summer and gained momentum during fall even as Covid-19 infections soared to record levels. 

     U.S. commodity producers have benefited as well from strengthening global prices and increasing demand, particularly for aluminum. Its cash price on the London Metal Exchange is up 39% from its April low, according to S&P Global Platts. The domestic price for prime steel scrap used to make new steel has risen 60% since November, aided by increased overseas demand. Turkey has sought out U.S. exports, and lately so too has China, which is importing scrap for the first time in nearly a decade. 

     ""We can sell everything we have,"" said Brad Serlin, president of United Scrap Metal Inc., near Chicago. ""Steel mills that were out of the market all of a sudden are doing big orders."" 

     Domestic steel mills in need of scrap started accepting shipments on Saturdays in late October for the first time in years, Mr. Serlin said. 

     Mr. Verhein of Church Metal said he had to delay deliveries of some orders because the parts maker couldn't obtain enough steel, and that which the company is able to buy costs twice as much as six months ago. 

     He said on some products he is opting to make less profit for now, rather than pass along higher prices to his customers. For other products where margins were already thin, Mr. Verhein said he has no choice but to raise Church's prices to avoid losing money. 

     Some manufacturers have stockpiled materials to guard against a lack of availability in the future. They are counting on being able to quickly recover the added cost of holding more inventory than usual with increased sales. 

     Optimas OE Solutions LLC, a manufacturer of bolts and fasteners, recently accumulated $2 million worth of steel wire at its Wood Dale, Ill., plant, up from $250,000 before the pandemic erupted in the U.S. last March. 

     ""That's going to give us an edge,"" Chief Executive Marc Strandquist said. ""The supply chains everywhere are running ragged right now. We can smother our customers with service."" 

     Mr. Strandquist said orders for fasteners from the commercial truck industry and farm machinery manufacturers have been strong lately, as demand for such equipment recovers from a slump that started before the pandemic. 

     Even as demand improves though, some manufacturers say they haven't been able to recover all their higher costs for materials. 

     At Northwest Hardwoods Inc., orders for lumber used in kitchen cabinets, flooring and the trim around doors and windows are up about 15% from a year ago on increasing construction of new homes. But the company said the cost of obtaining and processing maple and oak logs has been rising more than the prices it can charge for finished boards. Output at sawmills also is constrained by labor shortages. 

     ""It's not great on our margins,"" Chief Executive Nathan Jeppson said. ""I don't know of anybody who is making a lot of money."" 

     Since November, the Tacoma, Wash., company has been operating under bankruptcy protection that it attributed to collapsing orders from the pandemic last spring and falling exports to China because of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. lumber imposed in 2018.

365,"New York Transit Officials to Vote on Fare Increase

By Paul Berger 

     Leaders of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority are expected to decide this month whether to raise fares on New York City's subway and bus systems and regional commuter rails at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has taken a financial toll on many of its riders. 

     The MTA, the operator of the nation's largest transit system, instituted a schedule a decade ago of raising fare and toll revenues by about 4% every two years to keep pace with inflation. The authority's board members are slated to vote on increases to fares on Jan. 21 and on tolls next month. 

     Some board members want to delay the latest fare increases, which could take effect in the spring, because so many people are out of work. They also say the extra millions of dollars the increase could raise wouldn't dent the authority's expected deficits, which measure in the billions. 

     ""This isn't the time to do this,"" said David Jones, one of four voting MTA board members who represent Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. 

     Mr. Jones said he is considering asking for the fare vote to be delayed until at least the middle of the year. By that time he hopes the authority will have a clearer view of its finances, the regional economy and employment levels. 

     Robert Linn, another of Mr. de Blasio's appointees, said he favors imposing a fare increase that doesn't take effect until January 2022. Mr. Linn noted that the MTA recently secured $4 billion in the latest coronavirus aid package, which should see the authority through 2021. 

     Mr. Linn added that with mass-transit ridership down between 50% or more, an increase this year wouldn't generate much revenue. But it would hurt people like grocery-store and health-care workers who have continued to commute to work during the pandemic. 

     The state-controlled MTA is desperate for revenue. It balanced its 2020 budget using a $3.9 billion federal bailout and by borrowing more than $3 billion in short-term debt from the Federal Reserve's emergency lending program. 

     The MTA board is dominated by six appointees of Gov. Andrew Cuomo who control a plurality of its 14 votes and who are often supported by members recommended by the executives of outlying counties. 

     Transit advocates say Mr. Cuomo should find alternative ways of raising revenue such as taxing wealth and income rather than raising prices for essential workers. ""The governor needs to find progressive revenue raisers,"" said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for advocacy group Riders Alliance. 

     Representatives of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, declined to comment. Lawrence Schwartz, one of six voting board members appointed by Mr. Cuomo, said he didn't want to take a public position before he had a chance to discuss options with board colleagues ahead of and during their Jan. 21 meeting. ""I think there may be ways to generate the revenue the MTA needs without hurting people that rely on the system the most,"" he said. 

     Mr. Schwartz repeated previous comments he has made that he would like to keep the base fare for a subway or bus ride at $2.75 or discount it further. He also noted that the MTA loses a significant amount of revenue to fraud associated with people tampering with seven-day and 30-day unlimited Metrocards. Previously, he has suggested considering the elimination of some unlimited cards. 

     The authority held a series of public hearings at the end of last year to receive comments on a long list of fare and toll proposals that include eliminating seven-day and 30-day unlimited MetroCards and raising the base subway and bus fare to $3. The proposals also include a flat fare for most commuter rail riders and varying tolls at bridges and tunnels based on time of day. 

     Abbey Collins, an MTA spokeswoman, said, ""We recognize our customers are facing unprecedented hardship and the MTA Board will take all this into consideration as well as the thousands of public comments received after eight virtual hearings when making its decision."" 

     The MTA was in a fiscal crisis before the pandemic hit the New York metropolitan region in early 2020. Its precarious financial plan for the coming years, which assumed biennial fare and toll increases, included projected annual shortfalls of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

     The authority has reduced costs by freezing nonessential hiring and cutting contracts with consultants. Without federal aid, authority officials warn they may have to cut transit service by 40% or 50%. 

     ""We feel that the right balance right now would be to continue fare and toll increases as scheduled because the fiscal situation is so dire,"" said Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog, Citizens Budget Commission. 

     During normal times, the MTA carries about eight million people each weekday on two commuter railroads and on New York City's subway and bus systems. Its seven bridges and two tunnels earned revenue in 2019 of about $2 billion. 

     Although traffic at the authority's tolled crossings has almost recovered since the region shut down earlier last year, the authority doesn't expect mass-transit ridership to return to near pre-pandemic levels until 2024. 

     The Democratic victory in Georgia's Senate runoff elections on Jan. 5, which handed Democrats control of the U.S. Senate, has given officials hope the MTA could receive further federal aid. 

     They are also optimistic the incoming Biden administration will help to advance a congestion-pricing program to charge drivers entering Manhattan's central business district, which should raise billions of dollars to fund transit improvements. The plan, which requires federal approval, stalled under the Trump administration. It was supposed to begin around now.

366,"Global Markets Push Higher Ahead of Yellen&apos;s Senate Testimony -- Barrons.com

By Jack Denton 

     Global stocks pushed further into the green on Tuesday, ahead of the closely watched Congressional testimony of U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen, who is expected to advocate for fiscal policy to ""act big"" with interest rates at historic lows. 

     In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 1.39%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng surged 2.7%. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.83%. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2%. Paris' CAC 40 was trading just below flat and Frankfurt's DAX was up near 0..3%. The U.S. premarket looked set for a strong open, with Dow futures pointing up 150 points after U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. 

     Former Federal Reserve chair Yellen will have the opportunity to sell President-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan. Her confirmation hearing to the Senate Finance Committee will begin against the backdrop of an American economy continuing to struggle under the burden of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

     ""Yellen will also need to convince the more skeptical cohort of U.S. lawmakers that the new Biden fiscal plan, where there is agreement on another $1,400 stimulus check, but where the increases in the minimum wage and other safety net programs, are slightly more problematic, won't cause an unsustainable rise in the U.S. national debt,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. 

     ""This is the main concern of the more fiscally conservative U.S. lawmakers, and something that Janet Yellen will have to use all of her political skills to convince is necessary in the short term at least,"" Hewson added. 

     The dollar slipped on Tuesday by around 0.25%, as analysts considered whether Yellen would be a positive or negative force on the U.S. currency. 

     ""She's likely to emphasize the need to get employment back to where it was before the pandemic rather than worrying about inflation,"" said Marshall Gittler, an analyst at BDSwiss. ""That could be negative for the dollar. At the same time, she may also emphasize that the U.S. doesn't have a policy of weakening the dollar deliberately, which could be positive for the dollar."" 

     The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that passenger-car registrations fell by 3.3% in December 2020 compared with the year prior, topping off the worst year on record -- registrations in 2020 fell 24%. European car makers' stocks broadly fell, with Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW, and Renault all in the red. 

     Yet shares in Stellantis, the automotive giant formed out of the merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, were up close to 5%, extending the 7% rally yesterday in the stock's first day of trading. 

     But many of the winners and losers in global trading were tied to earnings as the reporting season gets under way. Analysts are closely watching how companies are faring almost a year into the Covid-19 pandemic. 

     Shares in London-listed mining giant Rio Tinto rose close to 1% after it reported that industrial activity in China, a key market, had rebounded to pre-Covid-19 levels, helping boost iron ore shipments in the fourth quarter by 2%. 

     But it isn't a sweet day of trading for Swiss chocolatier Lindt, which said that sales in 2020 melted 6.1% to 4.02 billion Swiss francs -- below expectations. The stock slipped more than 2%. 

     It's a quiet day on the data front, with year-over-year Chinese foreign direct investment due. As well, the International Energy Agency lowered forecasts for oil demand in the coming quarter by 600,000 barrels a day, as continued lockdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19 are expected to slow the recovery in crude prices. 

     It will be a big day for U.S. corporate earnings. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and State Street will report on Tuesday, and streaming platform Netflix will post results after the close.

368,"Global Energy Roundup: Market Talk

   The latest Market Talks covering Energy markets. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. 

  1022 GMT - Copper prices fall despite bullish comments from major miners as the dollar gains, undermining all dollar-denominated commodities. Three-month copper on the LME is down 0.6% at $8,374 a metric ton, while the ICE Dollar Index rises 0.3%. Major copper miners have been reporting earnings this week and sounding bullish on the metal's long-term prospects. Rio Tinto says in its earnings report that while demand growth appears to be currently slowing, the rise of electric vehicles, green stimulus measures and China's push for carbon neutrality ""indicates a strong copper-intensive outlook."" On Tuesday, BHP noted the same trends as likely drivers of future demand. (william.horner@wsj.com) 

  1015 GMT - Statistics Norway's Oil Investment Survey for the first quarter suggests the investment outlook is slightly better than feared in the near term, but uncertainty remains further out, Nordic financial-services group SEB says. While actual spending increased by 1% in 2020, the survey for 1Q revised estimated capex for 2021 higher by NOK7.3 billion to NOK174 billion, which suggests a much smaller fall this year than previously expected. The first estimate for 2022 showed that oil investment next year is estimated to decline 20.2% relative to the latest estimate for 2021. Although the 2022 estimate will likely be increased in future surveys, it still suggests the investment outlook remains bleak, SEB says. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com) 

  1011 GMT - It is likely Rio Tinto--and its peer BHP--will pivot more to growth from capital returns over the next 12-24 months, Jefferies reckons. ""The pathway to growth will likely include organic project development and, eventually, M&A,"" the bank says. Jefferies was impressed by Rio Tinto's 2020 earnings, and strikes an optimistic tone on 2021. ""We expect Ebitda from copper and aluminum to significantly increase in 2021 as prices continue to improve while iron ore Ebitda should also increase further year-on-year as prices remain strong,"" it says. Rio Tinto shares are last up 3.6% in London. (rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com; @RhiannonHoyle) 

  0956 GMT - Shares in Rio Tinto lead miners higher after it reported better-than-expected earnings and dividends. Rio is among the biggest FTSE 100 risers, up 4%, while Antofagasta, BHP and Anglo American all gain. UBS says Rio's earnings per share were 6% ahead of market consensus while the full-year dividend was 16% ahead of forecasts. The Swiss investment bank says the results were overall good as expected due to a high iron-ore price, though higher capital spending and unit costs were a small negative. (philip.waller@wsj.com) 

  0920 GMT - Brent crude oil is up 0.9% at $63.94 a barrel and WTI futures are up 0.8% at $60.50 a barrel, with oil holding onto its recent gains as the southern U.S. continues to freeze. Bloomberg reports that U.S. oil production has dropped 3.5 million barrels a day and Occidental has issued a force majeure to buyers as a result of the supply disruptions, ING's Warren Patterson says. The Texan winter storm is expected to continue until Thursday. In the meantime, ""the stronger price environment will put more attention on OPEC+"" when the alliance meets on March 4,"" he adds, with the pace of Saudi Arabia's return of the million barrels it unilaterally cut for February and March in the spotlight. (david.hodari@wsj.com; @davidhodari) 

  0911 GMT - Ceres Power's revenue expectations are impressive, Citi says, with sales in the second half of 2020 18% above the market consensus. The fuel cell technology company expects to report revenue of GBP32 million-GBP33 million for the 18 months ended Dec. 31. ""Given recent mini pull-back in shares we believe this better than expected revenue and cash result is a timely reminder to the market of Ceres' strong potential and of management's ability to deliver to market expectations, and indeed ahead of expectations,"" Citi says. The U.S. bank has a buy rating on the stock. (jaime.llinares@wsj.com) 

  0851 GMT -- April Brent sank to a low of $62.69 on Tuesday on a 30-minute chart, capped by key resistance at $63.75. This morning, Brent took another dip to $62.73 before posting a strong rebound and crossing above the $63.75 resistance that has been in place since Feb. 15, turning the intraday bias bullish. It has since swung back to the upper Bollinger band, while the relative strength index is well directed in the 60s, indicating continued upward momentum for Brent. A further rally should push Brent toward $64.25 and $64.70 on the upside. Only a return to key support at $63.25--just below the 50-period moving average--would bring about a bearish reversal. April Brent is trading at around $63.81 a barrel.

369,"Bond Selloff Prompts Stock Investors to Confront Rising Rates -- Update

By Sam Goldfarb 

     The sharp increase this month in U.S. government-bond yields is sending tremors through the stock market and forcing investors to more seriously confront the implications of rising interest rates. 

     The lift in yields largely reflects investor expectations of a strong economic recovery. However, the collateral damage could include higher borrowing costs for businesses, more options for investors who had seen few alternatives to stocks and less favorable valuation models for some hot technology shares, investors and analysts said. 

     As of Friday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at 1.344%, up from 1.157% just five trading sessions earlier and roughly 0.9% at the start of the year. 

     The S&P fell 0.7% for the week, dragged down largely by technology stocks, which after big gains in recent years are seen as especially vulnerable to rising yields. Banks, meanwhile, rose as investors bet that higher long-term interest rates would make their lending activity more profitable. 

     ""The market's wobbled a little bit,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network, an investment advisory and brokerage firm. ""The market has principally been saying hooray, the pandemic is coming under control and the economy is starting to grow again. But now we're actually starting to see the consequences of that in the form of higher rates, and I think the market's processing that."" 

     Stuck near historic lows for most of last year, Treasury yields have climbed in recent months along with investors' expectations for a strong economic rebound, driven in part by more debt-financed government spending. 

     The move over the past week caught investors' attention because no specific catalyst was apparent. That raised the prospect that yields could rise more quickly and unpredictably than expected -- an outcome that many believe would be more disruptive to other assets like stocks than a slow, orderly climb. 

     Rising yields, which result from falling bond prices, often reflect investor expectations of faster growth and an accompanying rise in inflation, which makes the interest payments of bonds less valuable. A pickup in inflation could also eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, though most investors don't expect that to happen in the near term. More government borrowing could boost yields as well just by increasing the supply of bonds. 

     Investors this week will monitor the latest developments in Washington, where House Democrats hope to finalize a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, as well as figures on consumer spending and earnings from consumer companies like Home Depot Inc. and Macy's Inc. 

     They will also keep watching Treasury yields, whose rise can hurt stocks in a few different ways, according to investors and analysts. 

     As yields move up, borrowing costs for most businesses should also rise, crimping profits. Higher yields could also prompt some risk-averse investors to sell stocks and return to government and corporate bonds, now that they will earn a more meaningful return. 

     Finally, many investors use the 10-year Treasury yield as a discount rate in formulas to value stocks. All else being equal, the expected cash flows of companies are considered less valuable when yields are higher. That could threaten many tech stocks because much of their earnings are expected to come further in the future. 

     Treasury yields remain extremely low by historical standards but aren't so low relative to stock prices, some argue. In recent years, the 12-month forward-earnings yield of world technology companies -- their expected earnings per share as a percentage of their stock price -- has generally exceeded the 10-year Treasury yield by at least 2.5 percentage points. 

     But the yield differential has recently fallen below that threshold, a sign that the stock-market rally that was previously justified by ultralow bond yields ""is turning irrational,"" Dhaval Joshi, chief European investment strategist at BCA Research, a Montreal-based investment research firm, wrote in a report last week. 

     Still, many investors aren't too worried about rising yields, seeing them mostly as a welcome sign that the economic outlook is improving. 

     ""Our base case is for the positives of a higher rate regime to outweigh the negatives,"" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. 

     Many professional stock investors have already baked higher yields into their valuation models, and the largest tech companies generally have earnings that justify their prices, he added. 

     Even so, rising yields could cause investors to rethink their allocations to different sectors, Mr. Peron said. 

     His own team started adding exposure in the second half of last year to companies such as certain retail brands and online travel businesses that stand to benefit from an economic recovery and are less vulnerable to rising rates. 

     The impact on stocks depends a lot on how high and how quickly yields can rise, analysts said. A range of analysts forecast that the 10-year Treasury yield will reach anywhere from 1.5% to 2% by the end of the year, as investors start preparing for future rate increases from the Fed. 

     So far the sudden rise in yields reflect uncertainty about the future more than any tangible changes in the economy. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that core consumer prices, excluding the often volatile food and energy categories, were essentially flat for the previous two months. 

     Treasury yields fell at the time, only to begin their latest steep ascent just two days later.

370,"Brent Crude Nears $60 Mark for First Time in 12 Months

  Brent crude oil is approaching $60 a barrel for the first time in a year, after the coronavirus pandemic prompted intense market volatility and questions about the health of the global economy. Following a sleepy January, during which vaccine hopes and lockdown measures appeared to counterbalance one another, prices have climbed this week. Brent is on course to close out the week 8% higher thanks to several factors. The OPEC+ ministerial monitoring committee saw the alliance commit to complying with production cuts. ""They confirmed the existing plan for additional oil coming to the market but importantly it'll be slow and the market responded positively to that,"" says IHS Markit's Spencer Welch. The market has also responded well to news that the nations rolling out Covid-19 vaccination programs appear to be keeping to their planned timetables. While ""there's a long way to go on vaccines [...] it does appear that on a global level we are hopefully past the peak of infections,"" Welch says. The Brent futures curve has also signaled the tightest demand for physical barrels of oil since January 2020, analysts say. The next challenge oil producers face is keeping prices at their current level. Global inventories remain well above their five-year average. ""It won't take long for some of the OPEC+ member states to say 'we want to produce more,' and that will have a downward effect on prices,"" Welch says. (david.hodari@wsj.com; @davidhodari)

371,"U.S. Stocks Tick Lower Ahead of Powell Testimony

By Will Horner and Xie Yu 

     U.S. stocks edged lower Wednesday as investors awaited comments from Jerome Powell, a day after the Federal Reserve chairman soothed unsettled markets. 

     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9 points, or less than 0.1%, shortly after the opening bell. The S&P 500 dropped 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%. 

     Stock markets have wavered in recent days following a strong start to the year, with highflying tech companies leading declines. Investors said a rise in government-bond yields, driven by improving growth prospects and rising inflation expectations, has accelerated a rotation out of the tech stocks that led markets higher during the pandemic, and into the stocks best placed to benefit from an end to lockdowns. 

     ""This really is a function of economies reopening,"" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Investment Funds. ""Bond yields are rising because of good vaccination rates in the U.S. and U.K. and it's prompting a simple rotation away from everything that did well last year, the stay-at-home stocks, to the ones that didn't, the go-outside stocks."" 

     ""It's a good story in some ways, in that the market is trying to price in that economies are going to reopen,"" he added. 

     The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, has risen to its highest level in a year this week. On Wednesday, it rose to 1.418%, from 1.363% Tuesday. 

     Mr. Powell reaffirmed Tuesday his commitment to keeping easy-monetary policies unchanged for the foreseeable future, which helped stem heavy losses among tech companies. Investors are awaiting a second day of testimony Wednesday to the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Powell is set to speak at 10 a.m. ET. 

     While the Fed has stuck to the same message since the pandemic hit, the strength of the recovery could prompt it to change course sooner than many investors have been expecting, said Paul O'Connor, head of multiasset management at Janus Henderson Investors. 

     ""Markets are expecting that to be a 2022 story, however we are seeing sizable upgrades to U.S. GDP. Somewhere in the middle of this year the discussion around tapering is going to have to take place,"" he said. 

     The latest batch of earnings reports will be in focus Wednesday. Nvidia, Booking Holdings and L Brands will release their reports after markets close. 

     Square fell 5% after the payments company reported a lower fourth-quarter profit late Tuesday. 

     Data on new homes sales will also be parsed when it is released at 10 a.m. ET. The U.S. housing market has performed well during the pandemic, due in part to strong demand and low mortgage rates. 

     Bitcoin rose 3.9% to $49,889.73 Wednesday after falling 13% Tuesday. Other cryptocurrencies that declined Tuesday, such as ether, also gained. 

     Tesla shares rose 3%. The company's share price has fluctuated along with bitcoin in recent days after the electric-vehicle maker said it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency. 

     Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index rose less than 0.1%. 

     Asia-Pacific indexes slipped. The biggest losses were in Hong Kong, where the city's government moved to capitalize on booming markets by increasing a levy on share trading. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped 3%, with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing falling 8.8%, even as the exchange operator unveiled record annual revenue and net profit. 

     Mainland China's CSI 300, which includes large companies listed in either Shenzhen or Shanghai, fell more than 2.5%, with index heavyweight Kweichow Moutai dropping more than 5%. The index has now dropped for four of the five sessions since the Lunar New Year break. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.6%. 

     Andy Maynard, head of equities at China Renaissance Securities, said investors were getting uneasy about expensive valuations after rapid run-ups in mainland Chinese and Hong Kong markets, particularly against a backdrop of rising bond yields. In a potential sign of growing caution, he noted: ""You don't see institutions buying on the dip.""

372,"Turkey&apos;s New Central Bank Head Seeks to Reassure Markets

By Jared Malsin in Cairo and Caitlin Ostroff in London 

     Turkey's newly appointed central bank governor sought to reassure markets on Sunday as investors braced for turmoil following the abrupt firing of his predecessor by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 

     Sahap Kavcioglu, a former member of parliament from Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party who was named to the post late Friday, said the bank's main objective is to achieve ""a permanent fall in inflation."" 

     In a statement, Mr. Kavcioglu outlined the importance of tackling inflation, saying it ""will foster macroeconomic stability"" by lowering borrowing costs and reducing ""country risk premiums,"" helping set the stage for sustainable growth. 

     The change in command atop the central bank -- a day after it again raised interest rates -- prompted concern among economists and investors about the trajectory of the economy in Turkey, an aspiring global power whose influence extends through the Middle East, Europe and beyond. 

     The previous governor, Naci Agbal, who was appointed in November of last year, had repeatedly raised interest rates in an effort to tame inflation. His dismissal has prompted concerns that his successor could move less aggressively to tighten monetary policy. 

     Mr. Kavcioglu, who had been working as a columnist at a pro-government newspaper, has publicly sided with Mr. Erdogan's preference for lower interest rates. 

     Economists were predicting a steep drop in the value of the Turkish lira when markets open on Monday morning, as investors move to scale back their exposure to Turkish assets until the likely course of policy becomes clearer. 

     ""It will cause chaos for the Turkish economy. You will see tomorrow morning when the markets are open,"" said Durmus Yilmaz, a former governor of the Turkish central bank and currently a member of parliament with the centrist opposition Iyi party. 

     A sharp decline in the value of Turkey's currency would ratchet up inflation, raise the cost of imported goods including oil, and hurt living standards for ordinary Turks, economists warned. 

     ""It really is puzzling. It makes no economic sense whatsoever,"" said Refet Gurkaynak, a leading Turkish economist at Bilkent University in Ankara, referring to Mr. Agbal's removal. 

     The firing of Mr. Agbal was the third time Mr. Erdogan has replaced a central bank chief in less than two years. Before the bank chief's ouster, the Turkish economy was already struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic, which wiped out tourism and slowed international trade, as well as a currency crisis that began in 2018. 

     The changer also comes as Mr. Erdogan has expanded his power within Turkey's political and economic system and asserted Turkey's influence abroad, intervening in wars in Syria, Libya, and the Caucasus region in recent years. 

     Within Turkey, the government is also intensifying a clampdown on some of Mr. Erdogan's opponents. Last week, a top Ankara prosecutor called for the banning of one of Turkey's largest political parties, the leftist People's Democratic Party, which the government accuses of having ties to a Kurdish militant group that is banned as a terrorist organization. 

     In the same set of decrees in which he fired Mr. Agbal, Mr. Erdogan withdrew Turkey from an international treaty known as the Istanbul Convention designed to combat violence against women, sparking criticism from women's groups and a rebuke from President Biden. Mr. Biden called the decision ""a disheartening step backward for the international movement to end violence against women globally."" 

     After years of unpredictable policy-making, Mr. Agbal's tenure inspired confidence from foreign investors. When Mr. Agbal began raising interest rates last year, investors poured a net $4.6 billion back into Turkish lira assets. Turkey remains dependent on foreign funds to finance its current-account deficit. 

     As a result, Mr. Agbal's removal surprised investors and economists. The most recent interest rate increase came on March 18, when the bank lifted its benchmark rate to 19% from 17%, triggering a surge in the value of the lira. 

     The rate increases put Mr. Agbal at odds with Mr. Erdogan, who has repeatedly expressed a preference for low interest rates, espousing the unorthodox view that high interest rates lead to inflation. ""I don't believe my country will develop with high interest rates,"" he said in a speech to a business group in January. 

     The new central bank chief, Mr. Kavcioglu, also criticized the rate increases in his newspaper columns, fueling concerns among investors that he will reverse Mr. Agbal's policies. 

     ""There's a disappointment to the investment case that a lot of people, including me, were building that there would be a cap on inflation and now that looks much less likely,"" said Kieran Curtis, an emerging-markets fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 

     The surprise change at the central bank is also fueling anxieties among some regular Turkish people who are worried about the country's economic and political trajectory. 

     ""In general, there is a problem with stability in the country."" said Cihan Ilter, the 35-year-old manager of two restaurants in Istanbul. 

     ""In the past, this wasn't so. We felt the effects of such higher level economic decisions, perhaps in a year or more. But now, because Turkish economy is very fragile, we feel the effects immediately,"" he said. 

     The decision is also likely to have a long-lasting impact on the credibility of Turkey's central bank, making it difficult to assuage concerns over higher inflation and price stability, said Maya Senussi, a senior economist at Oxford Economics. 

     Under Mr. Agbal's predecessor, Murat Uysal, cheap lending rates intended to boost growth created gaping holes in the country's current account as Turkish businesses and households imported more than they exported. 

     Concerns over the current-account deficit and interest rates below that of inflation caused foreign investors to pull a net $13.4 billion out of local currency bonds and stocks in the first 10 months of 2020. 

     The capital flight accelerated the lira's decline. The central bank opted to sell foreign currencies, from its own reserves and dollars borrowed from domestic banks, to buy the lira. 

     ""Like many people I'm pretty flabbergasted,"" said Erik Meyersson, a senior economist at Swedish bank Handelsbanken. ""Because of the appointment of Agbal, you've gotten investors to come back and that's pretty extraordinary. Now those portfolio flows, they will most likely reverse.""

373,"The Unstoppable Boom in IPOs Has to End Sometime. Right? -- Barron&apos;s

  Newly public stocks are having impressive trading debuts. Yet the explosion in the number of SPACs and the skyhigh valuations are causing some investors to worry. Are there echoes of the dot-com bubble? 

By Luisa Beltran 

     The market for new stocks is experiencing a moment of exuberance not seen in roughly 20 years. 

     So far this year, 302 U.S. initial public offerings have raised $102.3 billion as of March 10, according to Dealogic. That is up 763% from the 35 offerings, valued at $11 billion, for the same period in 2020. For all of 2020, there were 457 IPOs, collecting $167.8 billion. Before that, the high-water mark for IPOs came during the dot-com bubble of 1999 when 547 offerings raised about $108 billion. 

     More impressive than the volume has been the performance of these stocks. Over the past 12 months, the shares of 52 tech IPOs jumped an average of 65% on their first day of trading, according to data from Jay Ritter, a University of Florida professor who studies the IPO market. 

     Some IPOs have simply rocketed. TRX Insurance Brokers (ticker: TIRX) began trading in January, and its shares jumped 1,000% from a $4 offer price before the Nasdaq halted trading on its first day. The stock closed at $63.44 on Wednesday, up 1,486% from the IPO. EZGO Technologies (EZGO), an e-bike maker, roared 353% during its market debut in January, while Cloopen Group Holding (RAAS), a cloud-based communications provider, rose a mere 200% on its first day last month. 

     This past week, the videogame platform Roblox (RBLX) -- a direct listing -- soared on its public market debut. Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean e-commerce firm, opened 81% above its IPO price, giving the company a market value of $114 billion. Other big names are expected to come to market later this year, including Robinhood, Marqeta, Coinbase Global, and Instacart. 

     Not everyone, however, is happy with the boom in new issues. Some IPO investors are growing more cautious of what they see as super-frothy valuations. 

     ""I'd be pretty surprised if many of these valuations were still standing at this level in 12 months time,"" says Mark Hawtin, an investment director at GAM Investments, a European-based asset manager with $120 billion in assets under management. 

     Hawtin, who runs the GAM Star Disruptive Growth fund, which invests in IPOs, says he is finding it harder to buy into new issues right now compared with six or nine months ago. 

     ""There are companies I really like but I can't justify buying them because their price is too high,"" he tells Barron's. 

     IPOs, after their first initial price move, typically match over time the performance of the S&P 500 but this has changed. Hawtin points to the Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund (IPO), which tracks new issues for their first two years. The ETF is up 139.6% over the last year, while the S&P 500 has gained 43.5%. IPOs are getting a bump not only in their quote price but in the aftermarket, Hawtin says. ""This is indicative of the stretched valuation they have,"" he says. 

     Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have been the hottest corner of the market. Of the 302 IPOs so far this year, 80% are SPACs. Roughly 240 of these blank-check companies, valued at nearly $76 billion, went public as of March 10 compared with just 13 SPACs that collected roughly $3.9 billion for the same period last year, Dealogic says. 

     Many SPACs attract investors speculating on what business they might merge with. But Hawtin says that until a deal is announced, they should trade at their $10 trust value, effectively a call option on what will be the combined company. ""When the [SPAC's share] of the combined deal is worth more [than the shell company's cash in trust], then it makes sense for the price to move up,"" he says. 

     The red-hot IPO market has been a product of a long-running bull market, low interest rates, and a flood of liquidity in stocks as investors have few other places ""where you can expect any meaningful yield,"" says Dan Rosen, a partner at Commerce Ventures. 

     His firm has invested in 72 tech start-ups, including Bill.com Holdings (BILL), and Rosen says the last six months have been the best time for companies seeking to go public in his 20-years as a venture capitalist. 

     The revived enthusiasm many small investors have for stocks -- highlighted by the frenzy in the shares of GameStop (GME) and the like -- has also helped the IPO market. While retail investors may not be able to get into an offering, they can buy shares on the first day of trading. 

     That has spurred strong aftermarket gains for newly public businesses. In 2020, 165 operating companies went public, producing an equally weighted average first-day return of 41.6%, Ritter says. So far this year, the average is 33%. 

     GAM's Hawtin pointed to retail investors who are ""very passionate"" about certain stocks. ""They want to buy it and they can buy it in the aftermarket, and they will pay whatever price they have to pay,"" he says. 

     Such enthusiasm can be risky. Many of the companies going public now aren't generating any earnings. 

     Ross Yarrow, managing director U.S. equities at Robert W. Baird, looked at the first-quarter results for companies that went public last year. He found that 81% were unprofitable. He also analyzed companies that went public in 2000, the peak of the dot-com bubble. Roughly 73% were unprofitable one quarter after the IPO. 

     Growth prospects seem to trump a lack of earnings for newly public companies. Airbnb (ABNB) and DoorDash (DASH) produced two of the biggest IPOs of 2020. Airbnb on Feb. 25 posted a near $4 billion loss during its first earnings report as a public company, and the stock jumped 13% the next day. The same day, DoorDash said that losses more than doubled in the fourth quarter, to $312 million, from the period a year ago. Shares added nearly 2% the next day. 

     Is this the dot-com boom-and-bust all over again? 

     Hawtin, who was also an investor in 1999, thinks the current frothiness is different from 20 years ago. Then, companies were not valued on revenue, but on ""eyeballs and users,"" he remembers. 

     This time around, he thinks only certain sectors and stocks are frothy. The IPO market is ""very overvalued,"" but companies going public right now come armed with significant revenue and real growth, Hawtin says. 

     University of Florida's Ritter notes that companies going public now ""are generally fairly mature, if not profitable, with the exception of the biopharma sector, where the firms tend to be young and still in the R&D stage."" 

     While the IPO market shows no signs of cooling off anytime soon, a sharp increase in inflation or a geopolitical shock could put a stop to the market's frothiness, Commerce Venture's Rosen says. 

     GAM's Hawtin is more certain a correction is coming. ""It would be foolish to suggest now or next week is the moment it will turn,"" he says. ""I don't know the moment [the IPO market] will turn, but it will turn. Not if, but when. Ultimately, I think it will end in tears.""

  1646 ET - The IPC index of most traded stocks rises 0.3% to 47673, with Televisa jumping 6.6% and Cemex rising 4%. The peso continued recouping recent losses, trading at 20.61 to the US dollar compared with 20.89 yesterday. Banorte raised its growth estimate for Mexico this year to an above-consensus 5.3% from 4.1% previously, ""mainly due to the approval of a new fiscal stimulus package in the US, and a slightly quicker-than-expected reactivation of the Mexican economy."" (anthony.harrup@wsj.com) 

  1633 ET - The US dollar weakens broadly, with the WSJ Dollar Index falling 0.4%. The dollar weakens 0.5% against the euro but strengthens marginally against the generally weaker yen. Jobless claims decline to 712,000 last week and are close to their lowest level since the coronavirus caused layoffs across the US, while Biden signs the $1.9T coronavirus relief package. While the dollar is softer this week, it's firmed in 2021 so far, with some forex traders buying it to bet on a quick US recovery. (jonathan.vuocolo@wsj.com; @jonvuocolo) 

  1541 ET - The Bank of Canada is watching Canadian housing markets for signs of speculative activity amid rapid price growth in many markets, a central bank official says. Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri says a combination of unusual factors--including a hesitancy to list houses during a pandemic and a desire for more space--is pushing up house prices. But he says policy makers are also concerned about the possibility of speculative activity. ""It's something that we're monitoring closely."" (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael) 

  1434 ET - The Biden administration's policies should have a positive impact on the Canadian economy, a senior Bank of Canada official says. Deputy Governor Lawrence Schembri says he anticipates more predictable trade policy and stronger multilateral engagement under Biden compared with former president Donald Trump, who he said took a more unilateral approach. In a virtual question-and-answer session before a restaurant industry group, Schembri says there will still be disagreements on some matters, such as Buy American policies and the scrapping of the Keystone XL pipeline project. On the other hand, he says, US fiscal stimulus should benefit Canada through higher exports to the US. (kim.mackrael@wsj.com; @kimmackrael) 

  1404 ET - World-services trade accelerated in 4Q, but weakness in some sectors and an uneven distribution of Covid-19 vaccines cast doubt on the durability of the recovery, the World Trade Organization says.

  1327 ET - Fitch Ratings sees the default rate for high-yield bonds falling below 3% by May 2021 from a peak of 5.8% reached last year. The high-yield default rate stands at 5.1% currently, and the firm expects that rate to fall to 4.9% by the end of March, and further by May. There have only been two issuers who defaulted so far this year: Ferrellgas Partners and Peabody Energy, the rating firm also says. In February the total amount of debt on the rating firm's list of top bonds of concern fell to $23.6B from $25.8B, down 55% from the peak in May. (soma.biswas@wsj.com) 

  1219 ET - The OECD forecasts Canada will experience economic growth of 4.7% this year and 4% in 2022, following the 5.4% contraction recorded in 2020. OECD says in a report that the Canadian economy is on the road to recovery, though risks and uncertainties remain and some sectors are still vulnerable. Government support measures, such as wage subsidies and income support, prevented an even deeper downturn, the report says, though the unemployment rate remained above the OECD average in 4Q.

  1200 ET - European stocks gain after the European Central Bank says it will ramp up bond purchases to stem rising yields. A spike in yields can trigger a selloff in stocks so traders welcomed the ECB's announcement, CMC Markets analyst David Madden says. ""Several countries in the eurozone are heavily indebted so the last thing they need is higher borrowing costs, hence the ECB's desire to not let yields run higher.""

  1123 ET - The European Central Bank's decision Thursday to lean against rising bond yields is positive for the euro-dollar exchange rate, ING says. The ECB announced that it would significantly ramp up pandemic bond purchases over the coming quarter to curb rising yields. ""Not only does today's ECB decision help to limit the key USD tailwind of late (sharply rising U.S. Treasury yields), but as the eurozone economy starts to recover in the second quarter (with the pace of vaccination set to increase), EUR/USD should start moving higher, further helped by the deeply negative U.S. front-end real [inflation-adjusted] rates,"" ING currency strategist Petr Krpata says. ING expects EUR/USD to rise above 1.25 this summer from 1.1960 currently. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  1110 ET - The inflation outlook in Brazil is getting worse, with recent increases to fuel prices likely to boost the headline rate for March, according to Bank of America. Brazil's statistics agency says consumer prices rose 5.2% in February from a year earlier, a level close to the upper edge of the central-bank's target range of 2.25% to 5.25%. Bank of America says it raised its forecast for the 2021 consumer price index to 4.6% from 4% because of the recent upside pressure on prices. Bank of America says the 12-month rate should begin to decline in 2H because of the Brazilian economy's wide output gap. (jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com) 

  1101 ET - US employers had 6.9M unfilled jobs at the end of January, the Labor Department says. That was up from December, and continued a rising trend as the economy slowly opened further after spring 2020 shutdowns. But the level was down from 7.2M in January 2020. And even if jobs opened in January 2021 were filled, there would still be about 2.5M fewer positions on US payrolls than before the pandemic began. Job openings rose in January in health care, manufacturing and warehouse jobs, but fell in food service and local government jobs, excluding schools. (eric.morath@wsj.com) 

  1100 ET - The move taken by the European Central Bank isn't only the answer to higher bond yields but probably also the outcome of a controversial discussion at the ECB's Governing Council, Carsten Brzeski, ING's global head of macro, says. There are three main takeaways from today's ECB meeting, he says: First, the ECB will look through any temporary acceleration of inflation and expects inflation to slow down again next year; second, the ECB will front-load asset purchases in the coming months to underline its willingness to look through higher inflation and limit further bond yield increases; and third, the change of the balance of risk for the economic outlook suggests that any increase in the total size of the asset purchases is still far out and unlikely.

375,"Ship Stuck in Suez Canal Heightens Pressure on Global Supply Chain

By Costas Paris, Parmy Olson and Sarah McFarlane 

     The blockage of the Suez Canal by a grounded container ship will likely add delays and extra costs to an already pressured logistics industry, say executives, punctuating the tightness of the world's supply lines. 

     Oil prices rose and shipping stocks fell Wednesday as authorities in Egypt sought to dislodge a giant vessel blocking traffic on one of the world's busiest shipping arteries, with industry executives warning that even a brief delay could have an outsize impact. 

     Disruption on the 120-mile Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, comes as global supply lines are already grappling with the continuing effect of the coronavirus pandemic, a global shortage of computer chips and adverse weather. 

     The Suez Canal is a vital trade route for tankers carrying oil and natural gas, along with container ships moving manufactured goods such as clothing, electronics and heavy machinery from Asia to Europe and the other way around. Some 19,000 vessels crossed the Suez in 2020, according to the Suez Canal Authority. 

     The passage is a particular choke point for the energy industry, with about one-tenth of the world's seaborne oil trade flowing through it and the associated Sumed -- or Suez-Mediterranean -- pipeline in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

     On Wednesday, dozens of oil and liquefied-natural gas tankers were caught in congestion, according to commodities data company Kpler. 

     Traders said at least six cargoes of liquefied-natural gas from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, destined for Europe and Asia, were stuck but noted the congestion shouldn't be that problematic if resolved quickly. 

     ""It's not a big issue if fixed today, if it lasts it could be interesting,"" said a gas trader. 

     International crude prices were up more than 3%, a move some analysts attributed to worry about oil shipments. 

     Meanwhile, shares of some big shipping companies fell, with Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. down 4.6% and Nippon Yusen K.K. dropping 5.1%, amid expectations that the blockage could lead to delays and higher costs. 

     Around 30 container ships sailing from Asia to Europe cross the Canal every week moving roughly 380,000 containers according to Lars Jensen, chief executive of Denmark-based SeaIntelligence Consulting. 

     ""If we assume that vessels are full, this means 55,000 containers of cargo from Asia to Europe daily. The expectation is that it will take some two days to clear the canal, which will cause the delay of 110,000 containers,"" Mr. Jensen said. ""This increases the risk we will see port congestion in European ports one week from now."" 

     Clarksons Platou Securities said that if the ship were to be stuck for days, freight rates for box ships would head higher. Rates from Asia to Europe and across the Pacific have already been hovering at record levels over the past four months amid booming demand from e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Target Inc. after the Covid-19 imposed lockdowns. 

     ""While we would expect this to be a short-lived effect, the container ship industry is already very tight on capacity, with significant port congestion around the world,"" the investment bank said. 

     Container xChange, an online marketplace for renting or buying shipping containers, said Wednesday's delays would likely further push up rental prices for containers, which have already soared to $2,000 from $200 a container in the last three months, according to Co-CEO Johannes Schlingmeier. 

     Mr. Schlingmeier said his customers, about 550 freight-forwarding companies, were concerned about a possible new upsurge in pricing, especially since they appeared to be easing over the last two weeks due to the end of Lunar New Year. 

     Clients ""are afraid that this new event will just destroy these positive effects immediately again,"" he said. 

     The extent of the blockage's impact on electronics makers, already suffering from a crunch to the supply of chips, caused by a surge in demand for gaming consoles and laptops during lockdowns, is still unknown. 

     Only a handful of suppliers such as Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. make more than half the world's chips, although many companies in the industry ship products by air. For that reason the blockage is ""more likely to affect the finished goods than the chip manufacturers themselves,"" said Alan Priestley, an analyst covering emerging technology for Gartner Research. Recent shortages have raised semiconductor prices, but it was too early to see if today's disruption would push them higher, he added. 

     Peaks and troughs in demand for chips isn't unusual, but recent months have seen exaggerated effects that the industry isn't used to, said Tim Whitfield, chief of engineering at Imagination Technologies Group PLC, a semiconductor designer based in the U.K., who is monitoring the Suez disruption for its potential impact on the industry. 

     He said the blockage was the latest in a sequence of problematic events for the supply of chips: Earlier this month a fire at an automotive chip factory in Japan sent further reverberations through the chip supply chain. ""There seems to be a bit of a perfect storm at the moment,"" Mr. Whitfield said.

376,"Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Raises Selic Rate to 2.75%, Sees Another Hike at Next Meeting

 
   By Jeffrey T. Lewis 
 

  SAO PAULO--Brazil's central bank raised its benchmark lending rate Wednesday to try to slow recent price increases even as the economy is hit by the country's intensifying Covid-19 outbreak. 

  The Central Bank of Brazil raised the Selic to 2.75%, the first change to the rate since the bank cut it to a record low of 2% last August, and said it expects the Monetary Policy Committee to raise the rate by the same amount at its next meeting if the economy continues to evolve as expected. 

  ""For the next meeting, unless there is a significant change in inflation projections or in the balance of risks, the committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment, of the same magnitude, in the degree of monetary stimulus,"" the statement said. 

  The bank faces the difficult task of attacking rising prices while the country's economy flounders. Food prices rose rapidly in the closing months of 2020, and a weaker currency and higher costs for oil have pushed fuel prices up sharply this year just as the pandemic has spurred state governments to impose stronger social-distancing measures. 

  Consumer prices rose 5.2% in February from a year earlier, brushing up against the 5.25% upper limit of the central bank's target range. The bank's weekly survey of economists forecasts the 12-month inflation rate will slow to 4.6% by the end of this year, still considerably above the 3.75% center point of the range for 2021. 

  ""This year we'll have the experience of weaker growth amid rising prices, but as long as the central bank remains vigilant and fights the second-round effects of change in relative prices, we should be OK,"" said Roberto Secemski, an economist at Barclays in New York. 

  Economists have been trimming their forecasts for gross domestic product as the pandemic has gotten worse, with the central bank's survey showing expectations for an expansion of 3.23% this year, down from 3.41% at the start of 2021.

  Wheat Higher as Global Supply Looks to Fall 

  Wheat for May delivery rose 1.6% to $6.38 3/4 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, maintaining an uptick in prices after the WASDE report showed tighter world supplies for wheat. 

  Wheat futures on the CBOT found support following the release of the monthly WASDE by the USDA. In its report, the USDA cut world wheat ending stocks by 5.7 million metric tons, to 295.5 million tons. ""The 2020/21 global wheat outlook is for slightly smaller supplies, increased consumption, higher exports and reduced stocks this month,"" said the USDA in the report. World production is also projected to drop, with the USDA cutting it by 300,000 tons to 776.5 million tons. 

 

  Unsurprising WASDE Pares Corn Gains -- Market Talk 

  12:36 ET - US corn inventories were forecast lower by the USDA in its latest WASDE report released this afternoon -- estimating ending stocks at 1.35B bushels, down from a projection of 1.5B bushels last month. The cut was roughly what was anticipated by analysts surveyed by WSJ, which caused momentum in grains futures to grind to a halt. ""The report was fairly neutral in the corn,"" says Charlie Sernatinger of ED&F Man Capital. Corn futures were trading 0.9% higher before the WASDE's release, but are now trading up 0.5%.

  Soybeans Turn Lower as Wasde Suggests More Supply -- Market Talk 

  12:44 ET - Soybean futures are down following the USDA's release of its monthly Wasde report, with CBOT most active futures down 0.4%. Grains traders are reacting to the USDA not changing its outlook to US soybean ending inventories at 120M bushels. ""Soybean ending stocks stayed the same as the USDA reduces the residual to account for higher demand,"" Craig Turner of Daniels Trading says.

  Cattle Futures Sink as USDA Projects Higher Beef Production -- Market Talk 

  15:27 ET - Live cattle futures trading on the CME closed trading Friday down 2% to $1.22575 per pound. One reason for the drop in futures came from the USDA's WASDE report released at noon eastern time--which showed a higher beef production estimate based on the expectation of higher volumes of cattle slaughtered. However, the USDA did raise its target for cattle prices in 2021 ""on current price strength and firm demand."" Hog futures finished trading today up 0.2% to $1.0895 per pound, with the USDA calling for US pork production to be lower due to a slower pace of slaughter. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com; @kirkmaltais)

  Restaurants spent much of the past year trying to win back customers. Now, they are struggling to win back employees . Nationwide chains and independent eateries alike said they can't hire enough workers to staff kitchens and dining rooms, just as Covid-19 restrictions relax and more consumers want to eat out again. Fast-food operators, including owners of Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches restaurants, are offering signing bonuses for recruits. Chipotle Mexican Grill is offering free college tuition to employees who work at least 15 hours a week after four months on the job. Taco Bell is giving paid family leave to company-store managers.

   Top Stories Weird Science 

  After the worst year for the global economy since the Great Depression, the U.S. is set to lead a vigorous rebound in the West as mass vaccination against Covid-19 propels a return to more or less normal life. The revival will come in stages, with the U.S. and countries such as the U.K. recovering faster than those in the European Union, as the timing and speed of recoveries will depend largely on the pace and reach of vaccination, economists say. Economies in North America and Europe are expected to fire up as shops, restaurants and hotels throng with newly inoculated consumers armed with savings they amassed during the long pandemic. Moody's Analytics estimates households world-wide had $5.4 trillion in pandemic-related savings at the end of the first quarter, Jason Douglas and Paul Hannon report. 

  Data Thursday are expected to show that U.S. growth accelerated in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions eased and vaccination coverage increased. A separate report Friday is expected to show the 19-nation eurozone shrank in the first quarter, though more up-to-date business surveys suggest growth was already coming back in April. 

  Markets for everything from home-building materials to bitcoin to stocks are soaring, stirring up fresh fears that global markets are in a bubble . Rarely have so many assets been up this much at once. The price of lumber has shot up to all-time highs. Residential home sales in the U.S. are at levels last seen in 2006, before the housing bubble collapsed. And stocks are on a tear. The frenzy has extended far beyond conventional markets tracked by Wall Street firms. Bitcoin hurtled above $60,000 for the first time last month before pulling back. In the venture-capital world, investors are offering startups five times or more the amount of money they are requesting, Akane Otani and Michael Wursthorn report. 

  Americans are paying more to rent homes again, ending a stretch during the pandemic when they enjoyed flat or falling rental prices and widespread landlord concessions. Federal government stimulus payments and expanding payrolls are boosting savings, enabling building managers to lift rent prices on apartments and houses nationwide. A record-low inventory of homes for sale also leaves more people renting. Median asking rent rose 1.1% on an annual basis in March to $1,463 a month across the country's 50 largest markets, according to a report from Realtor.com. That marked the first month where the pace of rent growth had increased since last summer, Will Parker reports. 

   Balancing Act 

  The next big question for the Federal Reserve: how to signal its eventual tightening of the money spigot . The process of ending the Fed's giant bond-buying program, and subsequently raising interest rates, will take years unless inflation unexpectedly surges. Its first step down that road will be to start talking about it in the coming months or weeks-Chairman Jerome Powell's next big test with financial markets. This is delicate business for a central banker. The last time the Fed started telegraphing a reduction in its asset purchases, in 2013, it sparked a bond-market selloff known as the ""taper tantrum."" Yields on 10-year Treasury notes, which directly affect long-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, jumped half a percentage point in just one month, rattling Fed officials who worried they might undermine the recovery they had been trying to nurture, Paul Kiernan reports. 

  The Fed is expected to hold rates and bond purchases steady at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. 

   Covid Surges in India 

  India is in the grip of a Covid-19 surge that has hit with more speed and ferocity than any seen before in the more than yearlong coronavirus pandemic. It has overwhelmed New Delhi's chronically underfunded government hospitals and turned securing a private-hospital bed into a nearly impossible feat. India's surge came after loosening restrictions and public complacency set in, with highly contagious variants now spreading around the globe potentially serving as an accelerant. The outbreak threatens to extend the pandemic itself, driving world-wide numbers to new highs and creating an enormous viral pool that could become a breeding ground for new and potentially dangerous mutations, Vibhuti Agarwal, Shan Li and Suryatapa Bhattacharya report.

For most workers, the post-pandemic economy will entail more WFH than in the pre-Covid economy but considerably less than they would like. To put it another way, the benefits of a persistent shift to WFH will be broadly felt but flow mainly to the better educated and the highly paid,"" Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas Bloom and Steven Davis write in a working paper for the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute .

379,"Fed Expected to Keep Policy on Hold; Brisk Activity for Reverse Repos; Au Revoir to the Fed&apos;s Three-Month Currency Swaps

     Good day. Despite recent pickups in hiring, spending and inflation, Fed officials are widely expected to maintain their policy stance when their policy meeting wraps up today. One source of uncertainty hanging over the meeting is a surge in demand for the Fed's usually moribund reverse repo facility. Meanwhile, major central banks have announced the coming end of a Fed facility that provided hundreds of billions of dollars in international swaps and prevented a dollar funding crisis. Elsewhere, Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said a jump in inflation in the coming months shouldn't be seen as a sign that Canada's economy no longer requires stimulus. 

     Now on to today's news and analysis.

     Fed Likely to Keep Rates Near Zero as Recovery Picks Up 

     Federal Reserve officials are wrapping up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday at which they're likely to maintain ultralow interest rates to support the economy's accelerating recovery. 

     Fed officials have said they will hold rates steady until the labor market is back to full strength and inflation has reached the central bank's goal of averaging 2%. Chairman Jerome Powell has said those conditions are ""highly unlikely"" to materialize this year, and most Fed officials indicated last month that they expect to hold off on raising rates until 2024 at the earliest.

     Saying Au Revoir to the Most Successful Policy in Fed History 

     The Fed's three-month currency swaps to other central banks cost nothing and prevented a calamitous dollar funding crisis, Mike Bird writes, calling the program -- which will come to a close on July 1 -- a victim of its own success. More than $1 trillion was extended through it, split roughly equally over seven-day and three-month terms. At its peak, almost $450 billion was swapped, the lion's share to banks in Japan and the eurozone. The total has dropped to less than $1 billion.

     BOC: Inflation Spike Temporary, Not Result of Too Much Stimulus 

     Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said a temporary spike in inflation over the coming months shouldn't be taken as a sign Canada's economy no longer requires stimulus. Speaking before a parliamentary committee, he said annual inflation is expected to move close to 3% because price levels this spring will be compared to the sharply lower levels recorded 12 months ago, when lockdowns began in North America. ""We've actually been saying for some time...that inflation would go above the 2% target, for a period, on roughly the first anniversary of the pandemic,"" Mr. Macklem said. (Dow Jones Newswires)

380,"Bank of Canada Leaves Benchmark Interest Rate Unchanged, Will Slow Pace of Bond Buying -- 2nd Update

By Kim Mackrael 

     OTTAWA -- The Bank of Canada left its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged at 0.25% as it pulled forward its guidance on when it could next raise the key rate and announced plans to slow the pace of its bond buying in light of an improved economic outlook. 

     The announcement on Wednesday marks the first major step by a Group of Seven central bank toward withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus that was extended to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve said last week that it expected to slow the pace of its bond purchases before raising interest rates but hasn't said when it might begin a so-called taper. 

     The Bank of Canada said it would target a level of 3 billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $2.38 billion, in weekly bond purchases beginning the week of April 26. The central bank had maintained a weekly pace of at least C$4 billion in Government of Canada bond purchases since last fall. 

     Canada's central bank said it remained committed to keeping its policy interest rate at the effective lower bound, which officials have pegged at the current level of 0.25%, until economic slack is absorbed and its 2% inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on a strengthened economic outlook, that should happen during the second half of 2022, the bank said, earlier than a previous forecast of sometime in 2023. 

     ""There are brighter days ahead,"" Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said during a press conference. ""We think we are going to get back to a complete recovery sooner than we thought before."" 

     Analysts said the central bank's communications on Wednesday showed more confidence in the economic recovery than they had anticipated, and several said they believe interest rates could rise from their current, ultralow level as early as the second half of next year. The Canadian dollar strengthened sharply against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday morning. 

     In a report that was released alongside the rate decision, the central bank said confidence in the economic recovery has improved, even as Covid-19 variants have led to renewed lockdowns in Canada and other countries. Growth in the first quarter of 2021 is expected to be 7% on an annualized basis, the central bank said, well ahead of an earlier estimate for a 2.5% contraction. In the second quarter, growth should moderate to 3.5%. 

     ""The Bank of Canada has made a drastic U-turn in the space of three months from being extremely cautious to being extremely upbeat,"" BMO Capital Markets strategist Benjamin Reitzes said. He said BMO would review its forecasts in light of the central bank's latest guidance. 

     Still, Mr. Macklem said during his press conference that absorbing economic slack and returning sustainably to 2% inflation may not be enough for the central bank to immediately raise its benchmark interest rate. ""What we do when those conditions are met, we will have to assess that at that time,"" Mr. Macklem said. ""There's nothing mechanical."" 

     Canada is experiencing a third wave of Covid-19 infections that has prompted renewed economic restrictions in many parts of the country. The number of new reported Covid-19 cases in Canada surpassed those in the U.S. on a per capita basis earlier this month, and healthcare workers in some regions of Canada have warned they could be forced to ration care this spring if acute-care units continue to fill up. 

     The central bank said the impact of the pandemic's third wave is anticipated to be material but temporary, as the vaccine rollout continues and businesses and consumers adapt to virus-related restrictions. 

     Overall, the Bank of Canada anticipates economic growth of about 6.5% in 2021, higher than an earlier estimate for a 4% expansion. Growth is projected to come in at 3.7% in 2022 and 3.2% in 2023. 

     Fiscal and monetary support, foreign demand and higher commodity prices should all boost economic growth this year, the central bank said. Canada's Liberal government issued a budget plan on Monday that includes C$100 billion in spending over a three-year period, which it said should help the country recover from the pandemic and fuel growth.

381,"Nations Begin to Shape Post-Covid Economy Amid Diverging Fortunes

By Yuka Hayashi 

     WASHINGTON -- The world's top economic officials will meet virtually this week to steer the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Among their most pressing tasks: preventing lasting damage to the poorest and most vulnerable populations. 

     The global economy is rebounding faster than many economists projected, powered by growth in the U.S. and China and by the accelerating pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in many rich countries. Yet many low- and middle-income nations with limited financial resources are lagging behind. 

     ""Economic fortunes are diverging,"" Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, which will co-host the gathering along with the World Bank, said on Wednesday. ""Vaccines are not yet available to everyone and everywhere. Too many people continue to face job losses and rising poverty. Too many countries are falling behind."" 

     Among the steps contemplated by finance ministers and central bankers: additional grants to low-income countries, debt reduction and a more equitable distribution of vaccines. 

     Gaining momentum, in particular, is a plan to use IMF reserve assets, known as special drawing rights or SDRs, to provide liquidity to struggling countries without adding to their debt burdens. The Biden administration officially started a process Thursday to allow the IMF to issue SDRs valued at $650 billion, reversing the opposition by the Trump administration last year. 

     In a report to be released on Tuesday, the IMF plans to raise its forecast for global growth for this year, from the 5.5% expansion projected in January, Ms. Georgieva said in her presentation Wednesday. That would follow an estimated 3.5% contraction in 2020, the worst peacetime outcome since the Great Depression. 

     The recovery in large part is a result of the roughly $16 trillion in fiscal stimulus and liquidity injections from governments and central banks, primarily in wealthy nations, the IMF said. The U.S. government alone has pledged roughly $5 trillion in stimulus spending since the pandemic began. 

     The IMF in January projected 5.1% growth this year in the U.S. China, which more quickly brought the pandemic under control to resume production and exports, was forecast to grow 8.1%. 

     But in emerging and developing countries, the Covid-19 crisis has reduced per-capita gross domestic product by one-fifth -- nearly twice the loss among advanced economies, the IMF estimates. Last year, more than 100 million people, mostly in South Asia, fell into extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day. Globally, six million children could drop out of school this year, clouding their future prospects, the IMF says. 

     ""Rich governments have been able to approve trillions of dollars in stimulus packages for businesses, for cash transfers for people, vaccines, and for education, but what about lower- and middle-income countries?"" asked Nadia Daar, head of the Washington office of Oxfam International. ""The financial response the world has provided has just not been sufficient."" 

     Money to aid poor nations has been limited as major economies focused on fighting the pandemic and repairing their own economies. The Group of 20 major economies has provided $5 billion in debt-service relief for more than 40 low-income nations, but private-sector lenders haven't joined the effort. The external debts of low-income countries more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, to more than $750 billion, according to the Institute of International Finance. 

     To tackle the problem without adding to that burden, the IMF has proposed issuing $650 billion in SDRs, which could be exchanged for dollars or other hard currencies to cover obligations. Critics say that is an inefficient way to help poor nations because most of the SDRs will be given to rich countries that are the largest IMF shareholders. Republican lawmakers in the U.S. also say the issuance could aid repressive regimes and state-sponsored terrorism. 

     In response to those objections, the U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday that advanced economies are pursuing ways to lend some of their SDRs to low-income countries. The Treasury also said the U.S. can refuse to swap dollars for SDRs of countries whose policies diverge from U.S. interests. 

     Concerns are also emerging over the possible negative effects of the massive stimulus spending by the U.S. and other wealthy nations on the developing world. Stimulus could stoke inflation, prompting central banks to raise interest rates, thereby boosting the debt burden for countries. 

     ""One big question, which is common to all economies, is how quick should the withdrawal of the stimulus be and what happens when they are withdrawn and whether you'll see an increase in bankruptcies,"" Odile Renaud-Basso, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said in an interview. She added that so far, the global economy has shown enormous resilience. 

     Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly said he doesn't anticipate changing the central bank's easy monetary policy soon. Even so, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was 1.72% late last week, up from 0.91% at the end of last year, on signs of an accelerating economic rebound, but it remains low by historical standards. 

     Rising U.S. yields have drawn capital away from emerging markets, putting downward pressure on their currencies while fueling both inflation and future inflation fears. Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ousted the country's central bank governor, who had raised interest rates repeatedly in an effort to tame inflation.

382,"Pipeline Shutdown Has East Coast Drivers Making Run on Gas -- 2nd Update

By Collin Eaton, Amrith Ramkumar and Valerie Bauerlein 

     Drivers along parts of the East Coast piled into gas stations on Tuesday, resulting in long lines and shortages as motorists reacted to what could be a weeklong shutdown of the nation's largest fuel pipeline because of a cyberattack. 

     Colonial Pipeline Co., operator of a 5,500-mile conduit for gasoline, diesel and refined products, said Monday it hoped to substantially restore service by the end of the week. It shut the pipeline late last week after a ransomware attack that U.S. officials have linked to a criminal gang known as DarkSide. 

     The Colonial pipeline runs from Texas to New Jersey and carries about 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to the company's website. The shutdown is particularly worrisome for Southeastern states, including North and South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia; they have fewer sources of fuel than do states farther up the Atlantic Coast. 

     In the Raleigh, N.C., area on Tuesday, cars were lined up 30 deep to access a dozen pumps at a BJ's Wholesale Club. Lines three-cars long waited to fill up at a Sheetz convenience store near Raleigh-Durham International Airport, one of the rare stations around that still had fuel. 

     Shortages in the area were also afflicting gas-station owners like Mike Whalen, whose family owns three locations that were out of fuel on Tuesday. The vice president of finance for Whalen Corp. said he doesn't have alternative ways of getting gas or any sense for when his supply might be replenished. Plunging gasoline sales also mean fewer customers in the stations' stores buying drinks and snacks. 

     ""Am I losing money? Hell yeah I'm losing money,"" he said. 

     Gasoline demand Monday across the U.S. was up about 20% from a week earlier, according to data collected by price and fuel tracker GasBuddy. Across five Southeastern states -- Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia -- demand for gasoline jumped 40%, the figures showed. 

     Roughly 240 gas stations across Georgia, or 5.2% of the state's total, had run out of fuel by Tuesday afternoon, according to GasBuddy, which compiles the data when drivers report such outages. In Virginia, that figure was 7.6%. More than 7.5% of North Carolina gas stations were out of fuel and 2.9% of the total in South Carolina. 

     ""We're seeing a gas run,"" said Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis. ""Now we're going to see more dramatic [effects] as people run to the stations and run them dry."" 

     Truck-stop operator Love's Travel Stops & Country Stores is ""experiencing low levels of diesel and gasoline intermittently"" at locations in South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, a spokeswoman said. The company is leaning on its fuel trading and hauling affiliates to deliver supplies across the region, she said. 

     Roger Homan, a caregiver, said he went to four stations in the Raleigh-Durham area Tuesday morning seeking to fill up a car for a client. He said he called the BJ's Wholesale Club where he typically gases up, and was told to hurry over. By the time he arrived 15 minutes later, there was no gas. 

     ""Every place I went, they had cones up so you couldn't fill up,"" Mr. Homan said. 

     Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said at a Tuesday press conference that Colonial could make a decision on restarting operations on Wednesday but cautioned that it would take a few days after that for the pipeline to be fully active. She urged consumers not to panic-buy fuel. ""Much as there was no cause for hoarding toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic, there is no cause for hoarding gas now,"" she said. 

     The disruptions come with the average U.S. price of regular unleaded gasoline already approaching $3 a gallon and a 6 1/2 -year high. Many Americans are expected to hit the road for Memorial Day weekend travel and summer vacations after receiving coronavirus vaccines, and higher pump prices could magnify pressure on millions of consumers who are already facing higher costs for everything from appliances to chicken. 

     The national average gasoline price Tuesday morning was up about 2 cents at $2.985 a gallon, according to AAA. In Georgia, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was up more than 11 cents from the previous day; and in North Carolina, it rose about 5 cents, AAA data showed. 

     The Southeast is particularly vulnerable because it has fewer refineries and pipelines to deliver fuel. It is also more difficult for the region to quickly import large quantities of gasoline from other countries. 

     Frank Barnhill, a 58-year-old marketing professional living near Myrtle Beach, S.C., said gas stations in the area had long lines and began running out of fuel Monday evening. He had filled up early in the day and only needed a little bit at night, but now plans to limit his driving moving forward. 

     ""There is high anxiety,"" he said. 

     The pipeline shutdown is also rippling through the aviation industry. Concerns about jet-fuel shortages have caused changes to two American Airlines Inc. long-haul flight routes out of Charlotte Douglas International Airport, a spokesman said. And Southwest Airlines Co. is bringing additional fuel to Nashville International Airport to supplement local supplies, according to a spokesman. 

     In Raleigh, John Bootsma got a text Monday night from his daughter telling he had better fuel up. ""Here close to our house [in Charlotte, N.C.] there is no more gas,"" the text read. He went to the nearest station around 10:45 p.m., but every tank was locked off. At the next station, he purchased $23 worth of gasoline, but he was the last person there able to do so. 

     ""It all shut down as soon as I put the nozzle back on the pump,"" said Mr. Bootsma, a 55-year-old who advises churches and pastors. ""The computer sign came up and said, 'This pump has stopped pumping.' The other pumps said the same thing."" 

     State and national officials have taken steps to ease fuel shortages in recent days. On Tuesday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order temporarily suspending the state's gas tax and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper also declared a state of emergency Monday because of the outage. 

     Also on Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency waiver to ease some requirements for reformulated gasoline in the next week for Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. The move came after the Biden administration issued an emergency waiver extending hours for truck drivers delivering fuel across 17 states, including several across the Southeast. 

     Ann Faircloth said she drove 200 miles from High Point in central North Carolina to Halifax in the state's northeastern corner as part of her volunteer ministerial work. She said she had found stations out of gas throughout her route when she stopped to top off her tank. She bought $30 at the Sheetz near the Raleigh-Durham Airport, which she said she hoped would be enough to get her home. 

     Ms. Faircloth, 69, said the squeeze is sending prices higher than she budgeted for at $2.75 a gallon. ""It's really high now and that's hard because I'm retired and on a fixed income.""

383,"Grocers, Restaurants to Suppliers: Hurry Up, Make More -- WSJ

By Jesse Newman, Jaewon Kang and Annie Gasparro 

  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (May 8, 2021). 

     Friction between food retailers and their suppliers is adding costs across the food chain. 

     Big buyers including Walmart Inc. and Sysco Corp. are fining suppliers over infractions like late or incomplete orders. Retailers excused such penalties for months during the pandemic when surging demand led to widespread shortages. 

     Meanwhile, many food makers and distributors say labor shortages, supply constraints and high freight costs are making it difficult to deliver complete, timely orders for goods from cake mix to ramen noodles. Similar tensions are mounting throughout the U.S. economy, as industries contend with shortages of supplies and complications of reopening businesses in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Prices for many foods, consumer products and other goods are rising as a result. 

     ""The supply-chain challenges are still there,"" said Henk Hartong, chief executive officer of Brynwood Partners, which owns Hometown Food Co., the maker of Pillsbury cake mixes and Buitoni pasta. He said wheat costs have soared and shipments for ingredients including vitamin C for Sunny D are running behind: ""It's not just one thing, it's everything."" 

     Walmart told suppliers last fall that it would require orders to be 98% full and on time. Suppliers that didn't comply would be charged 3% of the cost of missing items, according to a September letter from the retail giant viewed by The Wall Street Journal. 

     ""We must improve product availability,"" Walmart's letter said. Spokeswoman Tara House said Walmart wants to save customers time and money by having the products they want online and in stores. 

     Food-distributor Sysco in February alerted suppliers to fees it would begin assessing in April for partial orders, billing discrepancies and missing data such as nutritional information, according to correspondence viewed by the Journal. Fees went into effect in April. Sysco also told suppliers it expects them to put its orders ahead of those from other customers. 

     ""We believe all our supplier partners subject to these policies have the capabilities to meet them,"" Sysco spokeswoman Shannon Mutschler said, adding that this will help restaurant customers as they reopen. 

     The shift in tone comes as companies are trying to get back to business as usual amid a reopening economy. Restaurants are adding back more seats in dining rooms, grocers are resuming service at salad and hot-food bars, and companies are bringing back more people to the office. 

     Retailers including Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons Cos. said they are struggling to secure some goods such as spices and cleaning products like detergent. Albertsons, which operates supermarket chains including Safeway and Jewel-Osco, has brought back fees in some categories, CEO Vivek Sankaran said. 

     ""It's about providing suppliers with better demand signals and making things simpler,"" Mr. Sankaran said. 

     While the fees are common among retailers, they are raising costs for suppliers on top of higher prices for fuel, transport, labor and some raw materials. Manufacturers are already raising prices for a range of food and other consumer products. ""Almost everything is going up,"" said Jagtar Nijjar, director of imports and commodities at distributor Gordon Food Service Inc. 

     Wise Pies is paying as much as $4,000 to ship a load of its pizzas, President Season Elliott said, compared with around $1,800 in August. Cheese prices have also almost doubled. Wise Pies is using more contractors to make and deliver some of its pizzas, which hurt profit but helped meet demand from distributors and retailers. The company hasn't raised prices. 

     ""We all want the same thing: to avoid out-of-stocks,"" Ms. Elliott said. 

     Thang Nguyen-Le, CEO of ramen-noodle brand Simply Food, said he is facing fines for delays and worries retailers could switch to competitors if he can't deliver. He is paying for refrigerated shipping containers and air shipments, though his products don't require either. 

     ""We've got to keep up shelf space even if it's at a loss,"" he said. 

     Utah-based distributor Nicholas and Co. was struggling to source milk and cream, so Nicole Mouskondis, the company's co-CEO, tried to arrange to buy milk from a dairy farmer with excess supplies. But a shortage of resin after winter storms closed chemical plants in the Southern U.S. left milk processors unable to procure the plastic jugs needed to bottle it. 

     ""There's a domino effect,"" said Ms. Mouskondis, whose company supplies restaurants including Subway and Panda Express. 

     Many restaurants haven't paid for some orders placed before the pandemic as they request more food to reopen. Distributors including Ms. Mouskondis have put some restaurants on payment plans. ""You can't repossess lettuce,"" she said. 

     Some restaurant chains have told distributors they could be fined for late deliveries, Ms. Mouskondis said, and some have replaced longtime suppliers with competitors that say they can procure the goods they need. 

     Suzanne Rajczi, CEO of New York-based distributor Ginsberg's Foods, said she is over-ordering many goods to improve her chances of having products her customers request. She is struggling to source blue cheese, for example, because cheese makers last year reduced inventories of varieties like Gorgonzola and Roquefort, which take months to age. 

     ""I can't make blue cheese any quicker,"" Ms. Rajczi said.

384,"Despite Lumber Boom, Few New Sawmills Coming

By Ryan Dezember 

     North America's sawmills can't keep up with demand, which has sent wood prices on a meteoric rise. Don't expect new mills to start popping up though. 

     Executives in the cyclical business of sawing logs into lumber said they are content to rake in cash while lumber prices are sky-high and aren't racing out to build new mills, which can cost hundreds of millions dollars and take two years to build from the ground up. 

     In doing so they are breaking with conventional wisdom in the commodities business, which states that the cure for high prices is high prices. Usually when prices for raw materials rise, refineries and smelters ramp up, farmers plant larger crops, wells are drilled, mines dug. New supplies flood into the market and prices retreat. 

     Home buyers and do-it-yourself-ers, who are paying more than four times the normal price for lumber, would like for that to happen. But they are flush thanks to historically low borrowing costs, rising home values and government stimulus. Demand has been unbowed by escalating prices. 

     Though lumber futures eased off last week's all-time highs, they remain more than twice the pre-pandemic record. Meanwhile, cash prices for framing lumber and structural panels reached new highs, according to pricing service Random Lengths. 

     Mill companies including Weyerhaeuser Co. and West Fraser Timber Co. have set nine-figure budgets to boost efficiency and output at their existing mills, particularly in the South where there is a glut of cheap pine timber. Some forest-products executives said they are considering acquisitions with their fast-accumulating cash. But there aren't many new mills on the drawing board for North America. 

     ""We are going to be ultra cautious on what we do in those regards,"" Canfor Corp. Chief Executive Don Kayne told investors last month when the company reported record quarterly profits. ""We don't mind at all having a little extra cash around for sure, considering what this industry goes through."" 

     U.S. lumber-making capacity has risen about 11% over the past five years, according to Forest Economic Advisors LLC. New mills in the pine belt between Georgia and east Texas have helped offset closures that have shrunk Canada's capacity, but there isn't much coming behind them. Idled facilities are restarting in Florida and Mississippi. A couple small mills are under construction out West. Four bigger mills have been announced but not begun in the South, the firm said. 

     Chad Hesters, who advises forest-product executives and investors as managing partner in the Houston office of consulting firm Korn Ferry, said the lumber boom has prompted clients to ask about building mills. He said he tells them they are too late. 

     Besides the time and money it takes to build a modern mill, equipment, from microprocessors to heavy machinery, is in short supply. So are the sort of workers needed to operate a computerized mill, especially in the rural places where timber is abundant, Mr. Hesters said. 

     ""Trying to build capacity and make investments that have a lot of lead time at the top of a cycle is historically a good way to lose money,"" Mr. Hesters said. 

     U.S. wood-product manufacturing peaked in January 2006, according to the Federal Reserve. A sharp decline that year foreshadowed the housing market's collapse. The least efficient mills shut down while others were consolidated. Big Canadian sawyers West Fraser, Canfor and Interfor Corp. have spent billions of dollars modernizing mills in the Southern pinelands ever since. 

     An example is in Summerville, S.C., where Interfor is boosting output at a lumber mill that it bought in March from a cardboard maker. The lumber boom has pushed up asking prices for mills, though, which may impede deals like that, forest-product executives said. 

     Meanwhile, stock analysts are advocating for mill companies to return cash to shareholders. BMO Capital Markets analyst Mark Wilde said it is hard to see how mill companies can spend their windfalls without destroying value, given the frothy market. 

     ""It's a lot of sailors hitting the town with a lot of money in their pocket, so silly things can happen,"" he said on Canfor's earnings call. He applauded Interfor's move Wednesday to pay a special dividend of $1.65 a share. 

     Added shifts and new equipment should increase output on the margins, but mill executives expect supplies to remain tight and for prices to remain high into next year. 

     ""Even if there was an opportunity to build inventories, distribution channels would be reluctant at current market prices,"" said Bart Bender, Interfor's head of sales and marketing. 

     Companies that buy wood from mills to distribute to builders, manufacturers and retailers have been limiting orders to exactly what customers need for fear of getting stuck with high-price inventory and falling prices, said Michael Goodman, whose family owns and operates Sherwood Lumber Corp. 

     The Melville, N.Y., company annually sells about a billion board feet of framing lumber to truss manufacturers, building-supply companies and shipping-crate makers. The firm doesn't expect additional supplies before late next year or even 2023 and has been trying to manage its risk in the white-knuckle market by taking positions in the futures market. 

     ""This is our job,"" Mr. Goodman said. ""We're a middleman. We can't not have stuff on the shelf.""

385,"Global Forex and Fixed Income Roundup: Market Talk

   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. 

  0819 GMT - Gold prices are edging lower in volatile trading as investors worry about whether inflation will push the Federal Reserve to tighten policy sooner than planned. Comex gold futures pare earlier gains and fall 0.5% to $1,814.30 a tory ounce. Stronger than expected signs of U.S. inflation have spooked the market. Investors fear strong inflation could prompt the central back to raise interest rates. However, Fed officials have stressed that they still think inflation will be fleeting, likely easing downward pressure on gold, says HSBC. Gold is likely to be volatile until June, when the Fed updates its inflation projections, the bank says. (william.horner@wsj.com) 

  0803 GMT - Better-than-forecast U.K. economic growth in March underscores the positive outlook for sterling and expected solid data this quarter should support the currency, ING says. ""We expect EUR/GBP to re-test the 0.8500 level in the coming weeks,"" ING analysts say. EUR/GBP rises 0.2% to 0.8604 and GBP/USD falls 0.1% to 1.4046. Sterling long positions, which expect the currency to strengthen, should start rising again after a recent trimming of those bets in the week to May 4, the analysts say, citing the latest CFTC data. Data on Wednesday showed the U.K. economy grew by 2.1% in March compared to a month ago, versus the 1.5% growth expected by economists in a WSJ survey. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0755 GMT - The rise in U.S. Treasury yields after Wednesday's release of higher-than-expected inflation in April was significant, ""but surely much smaller than would have occurred had investors interpreted the upside surprise as the beginnings of a more sinister trend,"" says Daiwa Capital Markets. Consumer prices rose 4.2% on the year in April, accelerating from 2.6% in March, and coming way above economists' consensus forecast of 3.6% in The Wall Street Journal's survey. The 10- and 30-year Treasury yields closed approximately seven basis points higher at 1.69% and 2.41%, respectively, and these are ""significant increases,"" Daiwa CM says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0752 GMT - Rolls-Royce's update for the first four months of 2021 shows that the firefighting is over and stability has been established, Jefferies says. The British engineering company's large engine flying hours were at 40% of their 2019 level in the period, exceeding Jefferies's expectations. Operational data from airlines like IAG and Lufthansa gave no reason to believe that engine flying hours had improved so Rolls-Royce's performance is better than expected, the bank says. ""What we need now is the promise of North Atlantic travel re-opening. Then, the picture could quickly look much brighter, in our view,"" it says. Jefferies has a buy rating and a 130 pence target price on the stock. Shares are down 1.4%, at 103.40 pence. (anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com) 

  0749 GMT - Revisions to the European Commission's forecasts, which was the case on Wednesday, ""are often a good indicator of change in the European Central Bank's own forecasts,"" says RBC Capital Markets. The EU Commission raised its forecast for the eurozone's GDP in 2021 and 2022 to 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively, from just 3.8% previously in both years. ""Yesterday's updated forecasts from the Commission thus suggest that the ECB is likely to upgrade its 2021 and 2022 projections, from 4.0% y/y and 4.1% y/y, respectively, at the June meeting,"" RBCCM says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0723 GMT - The 10-year German Bund yield is likely to touch the 0% level during the summer, says Danske Bank's chief strategist Piet Haines Christiansen. However, he wants to see a sustainable pickup in inflation before turning structurally bearish on bonds, he says. ""For me to turn structurally bearish on rates it would require an outlook with a sustainable pickup in inflation dynamics--also shared among households and corporates and not 'just' markets,"" he says. To actually pull inflation higher a tight labor market, including sizeable wage increases, is also required, he says. Danske still doesn't see inflation in the eurozone, ""so it may take a while before I structurally can see Bunds in e.g. +0.5%,"" Christiansen says. The 10-year Bund yield last trades at -0.127%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0721 GMT - U.S. consumer spending was strong at the end of the first quarter and sets the tone for a summer boom, says Gregory Daco chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. As health conditions improve and the economy reopens, generous fiscal stimulus, rebounding employment, and rising optimism will help unleash pent-up demand, he says. Oxford Economics projects real consumption growth of 9.6% for this year, which would mark the strongest performance since 1946, and 5.1% for 2022. While the outlook is on the high side of consensus expectations, risks are still tilted to the upside, he says. ""Should consumers spend 45% of their excess savings over the next 18 months, in line with the marginal propensity to spend out of income, real GDP could be 2.5% higher than in our baseline in 2022,"" Daco says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) 

  0718 GMT - With the start of the 2021 travel season in Europe on the horizon, a rebound in travel prices is expected to boost inflation later in the year, Goldman Sachs says. As both demand and the timing of 2021's tourism season are highly uncertain, Goldman Sachs has constructed three scenarios. In its baseline, travel prices recover somewhat this year, with travel price inflation reaching about 5% year-on-year in autumn. An upside scenario in which travel prices reach levels seen during the strong 2018 tourism season would add 10 basis points to eurozone core inflation in September. A downside scenario where this year's season is comparable to the 2020 season would take around 20 basis points off core inflation in autumn, Goldman Sachs says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) 

  0716 GMT - The dollar's fluctuation after a sharper-than-expected rise in April U.S. consumer prices suggests investors are torn between deciding whether higher inflation is good or bad for the currency, Commerzbank says. ""The main reason for this is because it isn't clear how the [Federal Reserve] will react to particular levels of inflation,"" Commerzbank's Thu Lan Nguyen says. Speculation that the Fed could scale back stimulus will grow if U.S. inflation continues to accelerate above expectations, she says. The dollar initially rose after data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices jumped 4.2% year-on-year in April before correcting lower then ending the day higher. The DXY dollar index last falls 0.1% to 90.6470 and EUR/USD rises 0.2% to 1.2099. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0714 GMT - The next round of government-bond syndications in the eurozone is likely to focus on the 10-year maturity segment, Commerzbank's rates strategists Hauke Siemssen and Rainer Guntermann say. They see Finland and Spain as countries likely to embark on new issues before the summer. Prior to any syndicated issues, though, both countries are set to line up for bond auctions next week, with the two scheduled to reveal auction details Friday. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0709 GMT - The market is pricing in the first interest rate increase by the European Central Bank in the second quarter of 2023, which is far too soon, says Danske Bank. The market prices the euro short-term rate at 10 basis points higher in that period, says Danske's chief strategist Piet Haines Christiansen. ""It's way too early to discuss rate hikes-even in 2023,"" he says. He attributes the rise in the euro short-term rate over the past month primarily to higher bond yields. The 10-year German Bund yield last trades 0.5 basis points lower at -0.127%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0708 GMT - Over a quarter of adults in the European Union are vaccine hesitant, with 29% of men and 25% of women indicating that they were either ""very unlikely"" or ""rather unlikely"" to take the Covid-19 vaccine, a Eurofound's survey shows. The survey found an association between vaccine hesitancy and social-media use, particularly when social media is the main source of information, Eurofound says. The intention to get vaccinated varies considerably among member states, with an east-west divide. With the exceptions of Austria and France, the intention to get vaccinated is over 60% for all western member states, while among eastern states the rate is lower, ranging from 59% in Romania to 33% in Bulgaria, the survey shows.

386,"Commodity Prices Have Soared, but Miners Aren&apos;t Investing

By Alistair MacDonald 

     Despite a commodity boom that is boosting profits, miners aren't throwing cash at new projects, raising concerns about future shortages of some metals. 

     So-called technology metals, such as cobalt, copper and lithium, are set for particularly large deficits, analysts say, amid rising demand from makers of batteries, electric cars and wind turbines. Supply constraints threaten to slow countries' plans to reduce emissions and make them more expensive, they say. 

     Though off their highs, many mined commodities have hit record prices this year as the global economy bounces back from Covid-19, governments increase spending on infrastructure and supply stutters for some resources. For instance, the price of copper -- used in construction and to conduct electricity -- has almost doubled over the past 12 months to a record of $10,762 a metric ton earlier this month. 

     But miners have been reluctant to invest in new projects, analysts and executives say, because their investors have in recent years wanted higher dividends after seeing the sector burn through cash during the last commodity bull run. That hesitancy is now raising the specter of supply crunches. 

     ""We are starting to see some pinch points appear in the key energy-transition metals, copper and platinum group metals for example, where there is very little new supply ready to fill the gap,"" says Anglo American PLC Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pearce. 

     ""You have to continuously reinvest to keep filling your resources cupboard, and it takes many years to bring new mines to fruition,"" he adds. London-listed Anglo has been among the bigger spenders on new and existing projects in recent years. 

     Overall, though, spending across the industry isn't keeping pace with demand and is expected to lead to shortfalls for many resources, analysts say. Capital spending is set to fall by 6% among major diversified mining companies and 10% among copper miners this year, according to analysts' consensus. 

     Meanwhile, the total demand for copper is forecast to increase 40% by 2030 -- with so-called green demand jumping by as much as 900% -- according to Goldman Sachs Group, leaving a supply shortfall of 8.2 million metric tons. Even as copper prices have rallied over the past 12 months, no material new mines have been approved, it added. 

     At current metal prices, Rio Tinto PLC, BHP Group Ltd., Anglo American and Glencore PLC could this year generate a combined $140 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Royal Bank of Canada. That compares with $44 billion in 2015, a year when metals prices were at or near lows. 

     To be sure, there has been investment in some areas of mining, particularly in the iron ore market. But miners' focus has been on returning cash to investors. 

     Capital expenditure, including money spent on current and future production, rose 30% to $75 billion last year among 45 of the world's largest miners, according to investment bank Liberum, while dividends nearly doubled to $66.1 billion. The capital spend was a third lower than in 2012, at the end of the last commodity bull run, while dividends were 125% higher, Liberum says. 

     Miners are returning more money to investors, analysts and executives say, after overspending on projects and acquisitions during that last run, which lasted for a decade. Investors then deserted the sector, some miners went bankrupt, and many chief executives lost their jobs. 

     ""Investors remain very conscious the last bear cycle was driven by an overbuild of new capacity,"" says Robert Crayfourd, who invests in miners at London-based fund CQS New City Investment Managers. ""The point is here, that maybe they are being too cautious."" 

     Some miners admit there isn't enough cash being spent on new projects. 

     ""Our industry's capital discipline and decline in exploration success over a number of years means there are fewer high-quality growth projects in the industry pipeline to meet this demand,"" BHP's Chief Executive Mike Henry told an industry conference last week. 

     Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow has recently complained that investor clamor for dividends means the industry isn't replacing what is being mined. 

     While analysts expect miners to start investing more in new projects if commodity prices remain elevated, mines typically take 10 to 15 years to develop. That has prompted some analysts and executives to worry that shortfalls could hurt governments' attempts to drive down carbon emissions. 

     To achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, there needs to be a quadrupling of the supply of minerals needed for clean-energy technologies by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. The Biden administration this year rejoined the accord, which calls for cutting emissions enough to limit the rise in global temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. 

     ""The data shows a looming mismatch between the world's strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of critical minerals that are essential to realizing those ambitions,"" Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, said in a report last month. 

     For instance, the Paris-based energy watchdog says expected supply from existing mines and projects under construction is estimated to meet only half of projected lithium and cobalt requirements by 2030. Both metals are key components of batteries for electric cars and energy storage. 

     ""This will likely mean that decarbonization could cost more than is currently estimated and will be a structurally inflationary force for some time,"" says Tyler Broda, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada.

387,"Cheap Dollars Attract Foreign Investors to Treasurys -- WSJ

By Anna Hirtenstein 

  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 12, 2021). 

     The cheapest dollars in years are spurring a rise in foreign investment in U.S. government bonds at the same time that pension funds are boosting their holdings -- and that demand pickup could weigh on Treasury rates even as the economy strengthens. 

     The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, is down 2.4% this quarter so far and hovering close to the lowest level in about five months. The price of hedging dollars through forward rates also was the cheapest in at least six years last week and remains close by, according to analysis from Deutsche Bank. 

     ""If I were to buy a bond market, which is the case for a lot of investors, I would buy the U.S. Treasury,"" said Laurent Crosnier, chief investment officer of Amundi's London branch, Europe's largest asset manager. The positive yield and low hedging cost ""makes the U.S. Treasury attractive relative to others."" 

     The benchmark 10-year government bond yield slipped below 1.5% earlier this past week, closing at 1.462% on Friday -- near its lowest level since March 3. Prices rise when yields fall. 

     Government bonds are popular in times of poorer economic performance for safety and liquidity. The recovery from the pandemic is widely expected to result in fund managers cutting their holdings as they position their portfolios for better times and less uncertainty. 

     Investors are widely expecting an increase in inflation from a combination of pent-up demand, supply constraints and stimulus spending. This is also seen as negative for conventional bonds, whose fixed cash flows lose purchasing power when prices rise. 

     Despite this, recent Treasury bond auctions have seen an uptick in demand from foreign investors. A 5-year debt sale on May 26 received the most bids from overseas investors since August at over 64%. A 7-year issuance in the same week saw the most since January. The latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed that major foreign investors upped their holdings of longer-maturity U.S. government bonds in March. 

     The dollar depreciation is linked to the high levels of liquidity in the market from a combination of Federal Reserve stimulus and colossal fiscal spending from the White House, analysts said. 

     Cash holdings have ballooned during Covid-19 lockdowns, with deposits at commercial banks in the U.S. sitting at a record $17.1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Assets in money-market funds total $4.6 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute, which is close to record levels. 

     U.S. money-market yields have come under pressure from the excess liquidity, with some pushed toward zero. 

     Forward rates, which are used to lock in an exchange rate at a certain point in the future and reduce the risk of currency fluctuations, are priced based on money-market rates and the difference between yields in the two currencies' domestic short-term debt markets. The smaller the gap, the cheaper the trade -- and that is just what has happened as the U.S. rates have come down. 

     ""If you take a 10-year U.S. Treasury and you hedge with a three-month forward, the yield you get is around 0.9%,"" said Althea Spinozzi, a fixed-income strategist at Saxo Bank. 

     That is higher than all European government bonds of the same maturity. Italy's 10-year bond yield was 0.693% on Friday. Japan's equivalent bond yielded 0.030%. 

     To be sure, many analysts are expecting Treasury yields to tick up as U.S. economic growth and inflation pick up. The median of 47 estimates projects that the benchmark 10-year government bond yield will reach 1.90% by the end of the year, according to data from FactSet. 

     ""That means that if you were to act on that trade now, that second selloff could wipe out the carry returns you were hoping to make,"" said Ralf Preusser, a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America. 

     ""We think the selloff in dollar rates will be slower and more gradual once we hit 2% for the 10-year. That is where we expect this to start kicking in, with flows from European and Japanese investors,"" he said. 

     Another source of money flowing into Treasurys has been pension funds. Strong rallies in riskier assets, like stocks, in recent months helped to close the shortfall many funds have between the value of their assets and their liabilities, allowing them to move cash into safer assets, like bonds. 

     U.S. pension funds shifted nearly $90 billion of funds out of stocks and into fixed income during the first quarter of this year, $41 billion of which went into Treasurys, according to analysts at Bank of America. 

     These flows have helped to hold down yields, but Mike Bell, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said he expects 10-year yields to rise to about 2% over the next 12 months -- and that level would lure even more investment flows. 

     ""The rise in yields from there will be a lot slower and Treasurys will be much more attractive,"" he said.

388,"Streetwise: A Return to the Office Will Suit These Retail And Apparel Stocks -- Barron&apos;s

By Jack Hough 

     I've been thinking about fashion, which wasn't supposed to happen. My plan at work has long been to stick with suits and dress shoes -- a strategically nondescript and immediately forgettable mix of Brooks Brothers and Allen Edmonds -- for a set-in-his-ways look I can ride out for another decade or two. 

     For weekends, I feel that my wardrobe still holds up. It includes L.L. Bean golf shirts and New Balance sneakers, an aging-dad power combo best accessorized with groaning loudly while easing into patio furniture. But the pandemic has left me less sure about the suits. 

     For more than a year, professionals have been wearing fleece below the Zoom line, and in some cases above it. An unspoken consensus seems to be forming around urban workers returning en masse to their offices around Labor Day. Suppose I go back in a suit, and I'm the only one? I'll stand out like a Times Square street performer, and with no disrespect to handsy Elmo or the underpants cowboy, that's not what I'm going for. Then again, what if I dress down only to learn that everyone else has pent-up demand for dressing up? 

     Also, my suit pants resist buttoning at the moment, but let's not get sidetracked with logistics. 

     J.P. Morgan expects U.S. apparel revenue to jump 21% this year from last year's depressed level, and to come in 6% above the more normal revenue seen in 2019. A recent Jefferies survey of women shows that more than 60% say that their wardrobes are out of style and they plan to do more shopping soon. 

     Apparel has been a deflationary good for decades, but in May, prices were up 5.6% from a year ago, topping the overall inflation rate. Covid-19 has claimed thousands of clothing stores, leaving survivors with more pricing power. Supply-chain jam-ups have raised shipping costs. Yarn-spinners and other textile players are short on workers. Demand is surging. 

     I'm starting to worry about a nationwide run on pants come August. But I don't want shoppers to panic -- at least not before I've had a chance to place my orders. Whatever happens, the apparel industry is poised for a stretch of solid profitability. 

     Among mass merchants, J.P. Morgan recommends shares of Target (ticker: TGT), which stands to benefit from fewer rival stores. Among brand owners, it likes Nike (NKE), V.F. Corp. ( VFC), and Levi Strauss (LEVI). Its picks for specialty stores include American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Boot Barn Holdings (BOOT), and Gap (GPS). Even once we get beyond ""RTO,"" as Wall Street is calling our return-to-office moment, inventories could remain lean going into the critical Christmas season. 

     Wells Fargo Securities analyst Ike Boruchow says investors should be careful to distinguish between thriving stores and attractively priced stocks. For example, he is impressed with Lululemon Athletica (LULU), the mainstay for ladies' yoga tights that's making a play for men. ""Full disclosure, I was wearing a lot of Lululemon to work prepandemic,"" says Boruchow, who highlights the company's stretchy, $128 ABC jeans and Commission chinos. ""You throw that on with a casual button-down shirt, and that's kind of the new look of what used to be a suit and tie."" But he cut his rating on the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight a year ago. 

     Boruchow likes shares of Ralph Lauren (RL), which was hit hard by the pandemic and therefore has much to gain from a return to normal shopping patterns. And he's bullish on ThredUp (TDUP), which collects and resells used clothing. 

     Don't forget accessories. Boruchow says the sharp acceleration toward online shopping during the pandemic leaves handbag sellers Tapestry (TPR) and Capri Holdings (CPRI) well positioned. Clothing sellers would generally prefer that shoppers do business in stores, where fixed costs are high and need to be covered, rather than online, where the cost of order fulfillment is largely variable. But handbags are an exception. Prices are high enough to absorb shipping costs, and return levels are low because sizing isn't an issue. 

     I spoke this past week with the chiefs of two relatively young clothiers. Sarah LaFleur runs M.M. LaFleur, which sells women's clothing and specializes in a look she calls power casual. Think chic but also stretchy, and machine washable. The impetus came from tech workers. ""Their male counterparts, they might be wearing hoodies and jeans,"" she says. ""But that's not what women are wearing. Yet, if we wear a dress to work, other people think that we're interviewing."" Her top tip for the first day back to work: Wear a size that fits, and be kind to yourself. ""It's a fraught time for everyone,"" she says. 

     Stitch Fix (SFIX) uses human stylists and artificial intelligence to select fashions for customers. Shares fetch $60, up from a November 2017 initial-public-offering price of $15, which makes the company more than half as valuable as Gap. 

     ""Consumers are looking for more guidance and more advice right now,"" says Stitch Fix President Elizabeth Spaulding, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1. Fierce growth in athleisure wear during the pandemic has given way to surges in ""fun, going-out clothes of summer"" -- jumpsuits, rompers, and midi skirts, she says. For me, Spaulding recommended an in-house brand of stretch-knit blazer called Artefact. 

     Speaking of artifacts, back to my suits. I knew time was not on their side, of course, long before Brooks Brothers and Men's Wearhouse filed for bankruptcy protection last year. There was that time I visited the chief of a big bank in his office several years ago, and he told me I looked too corporate. Among chat-room momentum traders, ""suits"" has become a put-down. Now, I fear we're headed toward seeing suits only on special occasions: weddings, burials, Mark Zuckerberg scoldings by Congress. 

     I guess now I'll face harder decisions than whether to wear charcoal or navy with one of my eight identical dress shirts. Unless all you suits out there want to make a last stand for starch come Labor Day.

  1003 GMT - The materials drought at German construction sites has worsened significantly, the Ifo Institute says. In building construction, 43.9% of companies reported in May that they were having problems procuring construction materials in time, up from 23.9% in April and just 5.6% in March, according to data by the Ifo Institute. Civil engineering was slightly less affected, with 33.5% of companies reporting shortages in the month, up from 11.5% in April. ""Capacity utilization in the industry is still high, but supply bottlenecks are causing worries for more and more companies,"" says Felix Leiss, survey expert at the Ifo Institute. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) 

  0950 GMT - The flash estimate for eurozone inflation for May came in at 2%on year and Oxford Economics says recent data on price expectations and signs of a strong rebound in economic activity in the eurozone suggest some upside risks to the inflation outlook this year. Base effects in energy prices continue to push up headline inflation and Rory Fennessy, assistant economist at Oxford Economics, expects this trend to continue. ""Overall, we expect inflation this year to be largely driven by transitory factors, and although core price pressures will pick up, these will continue to remain largely subdued,"" the economist says.(maria.martinez@wsj.com) 

  0941 GMT - Singapore shares ended higher, supported by bank and consumer-product stocks. Index heavyweight DBS Group rose 1.1%, while OCBC advanced 1.6% and UOB gained 0.9%. Airline catering company SATS topped index constituents with a 2.8% rise to its highest close in almost a month. Agribusiness company Wilmar International and Thai Beverage each finished 1.5% higher. Monday's top gainer, Mapletree Industrial Trust, was today's worst performer, losing 1.8%. The FTSE Straits Times Index closed 0.7% higher at 3187.23. Investors are likely to monitor the country's Covid-19 situation after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore is on track to bring the latest outbreak under control.(clarence.leong@wsj.com) 

  0938 GMT - Kingspan's new EUR700 million Planet Passionate Revolving Credit Facility neatly pulls together two of the most attractive themes the company has to offer, Davy Research says. Firstly, the building-and-insulation materials company's completion of the credit facility confirms its credentials as an extremely strong financial structure with plenty of opportunities, the Irish research firm says. Secondly, it shows that Kingspan is committed to dealing with the many environmental challenges facing the world, Davy says. ""Linking both is a willingness to be measured on the targets that have been embedded in its Planet Passionate strategy via the pricing of the new facility,"" the firm says. Davy retains its outperform rating. Shares are down 1.1% at 77.28 pence. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com) 

  0935 GMT - Manufacturing production in the U.K. probably surpassed its pre-pandemic level in May, at least six months before the services sector likely will fully recover, Pantheon Macroeconomics' chief U.K. economist Samuel Tombs says following the release of the manufacturing PMI. ""It is typical for manufacturing output to recover quickly immediately after a recession, as businesses rebuild stocks that they ran down during the crisis,"" he says. Orders also might be particularly high now because businesses have learned of supply shortages and are panic buying in response, Tombs says. The upswing in manufacturing is set to run out of steam soon and by the end of the year output is expected to fall back, he says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) 

  0929 GMT - Germany's jobless claims fell by 15,000 on the month in May and barring an unexpected setback, employment will rise sharply by summer at the latest, says Fritzi Koehler-Geib, chief economist at KfW. The adjusted unemployment rate was at 6.0% in May, unchanged from April, and Koehler-Geib says unemployment will fall noticeably and the number of people on short-time contracts will drop sharply by summer. However, for the labor market and for the economy as a whole to make a sustained recovery, she says vaccinations are essential. ""If hotels, restaurants, stationary retailers and cultural and sports venues open their doors again across Germany, consumption will pick up,"" she says, explaining that this surge in consumption would be ""a turbo igniter for the economy."" (maria.martinez@wsj.com) 

  0928 GMT - Japanese regional banks will likely struggle to restore profitability to pre-pandemic levels due to a subdued economic recovery and ultralow interest rates, Moody's says. About half of the country's listed regional banks reported drops in net income or net losses for the fiscal year ended March, the ratings company says. The average nonperforming loan ratio of 12 rated regional banks rose 15 basis points as of the end of March from a year earlier, Moody's says, adding it expects NPL ratios to rise further and loan loss provisions to stay elevated because default rates among businesses will rise amid a weak recovery.

  0927 GMT - Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' indexes show a picture of robust operating conditions midway through the second quarter, Claus Vistesen, senior eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says. ""Output growth slowed slightly, but remains robust overall, and the near-term outlook is positive due to brisk growth in sales and new orders,"" the economist says. However, the supply side is not that positive. Firms' purchasing activity is now at a record high and delivery times have soared in response, he says. ""Not surprisingly, input price inflation is rising sharply, forcing firms to respond in kind, by raising output charges,"" Vistesen says. On the positive side, employment seems to be in a solid uptrend and the outlook for the next 12 months is brightening, he says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) 

  0923 GMT - The index of German blue-chip companies - the DAX 30 - currently trading at 15,606, is escaping from a symmetrical triangle pattern in place since May 25th high. Prices are supported by the rising 20/50-simple moving averages on a 60-minute chart. Bollinger are widening, indicating that a new up leg may be on the cards. As long as 15,350 (May 27th low) is support, the bias remains bullish. Expect a further rise towards 15,671 and 15,730 in extension. Alternatively, a push below 15,350 would call for a reversal down trend with 15,100 as main target.

  0920 GMT - The dollar is likely to remain weak even with any improvement in upcoming U.S. economic data this week as the Federal Reserve maintains its loose monetary policy stance, ING says. ""We don't expect data this week to materially change market expectations about the Fed's policy stance, and the dollar's momentum may stay soft on the back of a still negative real rate [interest rate adjusted for inflation] narrative,"" ING analysts say.

  0918 GMT - Around 630,000 foreign tourists visited Spain in April, more than the 490,000 registered in March but far from the 7.15 million visitors who entered the country in April 2019, data from the Spanish statistics office INE show. No travellers came to Spain in April 2020, when the pandemic-induced lockdown prompted the closure of international borders. Spain will let vaccinated tourists from anywhere in the world enter the country from June 7 in an attempt to speed up the sector's recovery this summer. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) 

  0915 GMT - Hyve Group has confirmed that it is considering funding options to accelerate its post-pandemic growth and capitalize on market disruption, which indicates that there is scope for further market consolidation, Citi says. The events industry continues to be an extremely fragmented sector, Citi says. Moreover, the statement from U.K. events group Hyve is confirmation that the industry is of de facto interest for private-equity investors, the bank says. ""Putting this together, we think this is an encouraging development and underpins our positive view on the [events] subsector and in particular our Buys not only on Hyve but also RELX and Informa,"" Citi says.

390,"Heard on the Street: The End of the Boeing-Airbus Spat Begins the Aviation Battle With China -- WSJ

By Jon Sindreu 

  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 16, 2021). 

     There is nothing like a common enemy for bringing people together. 

     On Tuesday, the U.S. and the European Union agreed on a temporary end to the 17-year-old spat involving government subsidies given to plane makers Boeing and Airbus. Countries on both sides of the Atlantic have received authorization from the World Trade Organization to slap a total of $12 billion of retaliatory tariffs on each other, but a four-month suspension was agreed in March. It will now be extended for five years. 

     This was always a war without winners. By cementing Boeing's dominance and then allowing for Airbus' rise, government aid has helped make the commercial-jet industry more competitive, not less. With the aviation industry in tatters because of the pandemic and many carriers having been bailed out by the public sector, keeping this legal feud alive was dangerous for all parties involved. 

     Negotiations have also been pushed along by the Biden administration's more conciliatory stance toward trade relative to former President Trump. Even before the U.S. election last November, however, there were signs that officials were poised to reach a deal. There was a crucial factor driving it: China. 

     The Asian giant is determined to follow in Airbus' footsteps, with state-owned aerospace manufacturer Comac taking center stage in the government's ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. Comac has developed a narrow-body jet called the C919, which is scheduled to enter service later this year as a direct competitor to the powerhouse Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families. China has also partnered with Russia to build a wide-body aircraft, the C929, that could take on long-haul routes. An aerospace alliance between these two countries could become a real threat in the long run. 

     For now, China still needs time. The C919 is inferior to the A320neo and 737 MAX in every respect: It has less range, burns more fuel and, crucially, doesn't have an international support network that makes it marketable abroad. Furthermore, China isn't yet self-sufficient in the most complex parts of the aerospace supply chain: The C919 will start by using engines made by General Electric and Safran. This gives the West a geopolitical pressure point. 

     For investors, though, the prospect of Boeing and Airbus losing market share in the huge and faster-growing domestic Chinese market is reason enough for concern. As a recent analysis by Barclays pointed out, China's jet orders are very low compared with how many it will need. That in part looks like a way to put pressure on the U.S.; Beijing still hasn't recertified the MAX. But A320 orders also are abnormally low, which may reflect hopes that the C919 can fill part of the gap. 

     It is thus in U.S. and European interests to cease mutual hostilities and present a unified legal front. The C919 development, while benefiting some Western suppliers, almost certainly contravened WTO rules too. Given that China can instruct its state-owned airlines to buy as many homemade planes as necessary at the desired prices, a key source of concern should be government procurement, and what counts as such. 

     Historically, government intervention has served to create challengers that have made the aerospace industry more competitive. China has the scale necessary to repeat the cycle. While the end of a pointless and expensive legal battle is a welcome development for investors, it also highlights the seriousness of the long-term threat Boeing and Airbus face.

  Italy's Illycaffè Sets Its Sights on the U.S. Coffee Market 

  Andrea Illy, chairman of Illycaffè SpA, and grandson of the founder, wants more Americans to appreciate his family's coffee. In a bid to build U.S. brand awareness, the Italian-based company plans to add about a dozen Illy Caffès and shops this year to its 20 already in service in the U.S. 

  There are just a few problems-including American taste in coffee. Most consumers in the U.S. favor giant, sweetened coffee drinks, rather than Illy's signature small cups of espresso. 

   
 
 

  Israel Gets New Government to End Netanyahu's 12-Year Rule 

  TEL AVIV-A new Israeli coalition government led by commando-turned-tech entrepreneur Naftali Bennett ended Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year run in power, but now faces the difficult tasks of reviving an economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and preserving a fragile cease-fire with Palestinian militant group Hamas. 

  Mr. Bennett of the right-wing Yamina party took over as prime minister Sunday after his new, wide-ranging coalition was backed by 60 lawmakers in the 120-member Knesset, ending months of stalemate. Fifty-nine lawmakers voted against his coalition and one abstained. 

   
 
 

  Ousted From Power, Israel's Netanyahu Plots Comeback 

  TEL AVIV-Outmaneuvered by rival politicians after 12 years in power, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already plotting a comeback, intending to challenge the new government on matters that could deeply divide the cross-party coalition. 

  Mr. Netanyahu, who now is expected to lead the opposition, plans to press the new governing coalition, which includes eight parties ranging from an Arab group to conservative forces, on sensitive policy issues such as settlement construction and empowering the country's Arabs. 

   
 
 

  Biden and Macron Share Affection and Worldview at G-7 Summit 

  President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron threw their arms around each other as they walked on the beach. Later the two men shared a tête-à-tête as aides looked on. At one point Mr. Biden asked Mr. Macron to answer a reporter's question for him. 

  At the summit of the Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall this weekend, the two presidents embraced each other, sometimes literally, as allies on a host of issues-from multilateralism to fighting climate change-after years of volatility between Mr. Macron and former President Donald Trump. 

   
 
 
   
 
 

  GLOBAL NEWS 

  Investors Bet Green-Energy Focus Will Push Up Oil Prices 

  Some investors are wagering that Wall Street's preference for green energy will depress spending on oil extraction, setting the stage for supply shortages and higher fuel prices. 

  The bets come as money managers line up trillions of dollars for wind, solar and other renewable programs and expenditures on oil projects tumble. The drop in fossil-fuel spending is becoming so severe that energy companies could struggle to quench the world's thirst for oil, some analysts say. 

   
 
 

  Fed Officials Could Pencil In Earlier Rate Increase at Meeting 

  WASHINGTON-Federal Reserve officials could signal this week that they anticipate raising interest rates sooner than previously expected following a spate of high inflation readings. 

  In March, the last time they released quarterly economic forecasts, most officials expected to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate near zero through 2023 to encourage the economy's recovery from the pandemic. Officials are set to release updated projections Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting. 

   
 
 

  G-7 Leaders Rally to Biden's Call to Challenge China 

  CARBIS BAY, England-Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies called on China to respect human rights but stopped short of an outright condemnation of Beijing, as President Biden sought to build momentum for an international coalition to counter Chinese influence in the world. 

  A 25-page joint statement released by leaders of the G-7 nations on Sunday-covering issues ranging from pandemic recovery to the global economy, tax, trade and girls' education-asked China ""to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong."" The same section of the statement said the G-7 would continue to consult on how to challenge China's behavior in the global economy. 

   
 
 

  Economy Week Ahead: The Fed, Factories and Consumers 

  The Federal Reserve's policy meeting highlights this week's slate of economic news. 

   
 
 

  Markets Are Leaving Little Room for the Fed to Be Wrong on Inflation 

  Investors have faith in the Fed. Over the past three months consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy, have risen 2%, equivalent to a shockingly high annual rate of 8.2%. Rather than panic and dump bonds, investors have piled into Treasurys and pushed 10-year yields back down to where they stood in late February. Confidence in the central bank is absolute. 

  To be fair, the Fed is probably right: This burst of inflation is probably transitory. The reopening of the economy released a surge of pent-up demand, while supply bottlenecks are restricting production and distribution. As things get back to normal inflation should calm down. 

   
 
 

  Regulators Tell Banks It Is Time to Stop Using Libor 

  Regulators are ramping up efforts to end Libor trades by year-end. 

  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week told brokers that facilitate derivatives trading among large banks that they should stop using Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, as a reference rate by July 26. The Tuesday announcement could accelerate the push to phase out the troubled interest-rate benchmark, which underpins trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts. Authorities decided several years ago, after a widespread Libor-rigging scandal, that it should disappear by the end of 2021. 

   
 
 

  U.S. Fight Against Chinese 5G Efforts Shifts From Threats to Incentives 

  The U.S. government is ratcheting up pressure on Beijing's 5G ambitions overseas, offering financial incentives and other enticements to countries willing to shun Chinese-made telecom gear. 

  U.S. foreign-affairs agencies are developing workshops and a handbook that would help policy makers in places like Central and Eastern Europe, and in developing countries elsewhere, to build next-generation 5G cellular networks that don't use equipment from Huawei Technologies Co. and China's ZTE Corp.

   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. 

  0758 GMT - Five-year German government bonds, or Bobl, are expected to outperform longer-dated Bunds should reflation trades resume, says UniCredit fixed income strategist Francesco Maria Di Bella. Germany will launch new, October 2026-dated Bobl at an auction Wednesday. UniCredit calculates the fair value for the yield of the new Bobl at -0.57%, around three basis points higher than that of the April 2026 Bobl, the current five-year German benchmark. The new Bobl will be launched with a EUR5 billion offer volume. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0751 GMT - Copper prices rise after strong U.S. jobs data Friday boosted investors' confidence in the economy's rebound. Three-month copper on the LME gains 1.5% to $9,516.50 a metric ton. The employment report showed the U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs in June, significantly more than economists had been forecasting. The data ""showed more jobs being created, but not at a speed that would...prompt action from the Federal Reserve to taper, thus capping the dollar,"" said Anna Stablum at brokerage Marex. Concerns that strong economic data and rising inflation could prompt the central bank to withdraw its stimulus measures have been a primary concern among inventors since the Fed's meeting last month. (william.horner@wsj.com) 

  0732 GMT - EUR/USD last trades flat at 1.1858 but could drop below $1.1800 later this week when U.S. Federal Reserve minutes are released, likely stressing the risk of future monetary tightening, ING says. ""It is hard to put the Fed tightening genie back in the bottle now,"" it says. Falls in the euro may be limited, however, if official eurozone economic data confirm the improvement suggested by recent surveys. ""The best hope for EUR/USD now is that better activity data does indeed come through, raising expectations that the [European Central Bank] does have to taper in September and securing a floor for EUR/USD at 1.1700,"" ING says. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com) 

  0731 GMT - The Spanish service sector gathered further momentum in June, hitting its highest growth rate since March 2000, amid the continued easing of virus-related restrictions and the reopening of facilities previously closed due to the pandemic. The services PMI compiled by IHS Markit came in at 62.5 in June, up from 59.4 in May and well above the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction. Respondents to the survey reported a sharp uplift in demand, particularly in the hospitality and transport services sectors, the report says. If challenges related to the arrival of tourists from key markets can be resolved, the country will be on course for even stronger economic growth in the coming months, Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit, says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) 

  0717 GMT - Sterling may show little reaction to an expected announcement on the full easing of England's coronavirus measures, ING says. ""There will be much focus this week on what the U.K. government says about fully opening up the economy on July 19--although as the Bank of England admits, this final stage of the re-opening will have little impact on activity,"" ING analysts say. Given a quiet start to the week on the U.K. news front, EUR/GBP is likely to trade in a range of 0.8565 to 0.8615, they say. EUR/GBP is last flat at 0.8571. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0658 GMT - The dollar is likely to remain firm until upcoming economic data confirm the Federal Reserve's view that recent inflationary pressures will prove temporary, Commerzbank says. ""Quite some time is likely to pass until it is time to generally question the current moderate USD strength,"" Commerzbank currency analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann says. ""It will have to become clear that not much will be left of the current surge in inflation so that the Fed will not suddenly have to get active."" For now the outlook on inflation remains uncertain, he says. The DXY dollar index and EUR/USD are flat at 92.2480 and 1.1866 respectively. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0654 GMT - Natixis expects the first phase of the European Central Bank's tapering of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme to be a reduction of weekly purchases in the fourth quarter back to the levels seen at the beginning of the year. This would imply weekly purchases of EUR13.9 billion versus EUR18.1 billion since the March monetary policy meeting at which the ECB decided to carry out PEPP purchases at a significantly higher pace. Natixis calculates that there will be EUR350 billion left from the PEPP's EUR1.85 trillion envelope going into 2022. ""It will be quite a challenge to use all of this by the end of 1Q 2022,"" says strategist Jean-Christophe Machado. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0653 GMT - SGD ticks higher versus USD as Fed tapering concerns abate following mixed U.S. jobs data. While American employers added a better-than-expected 850,000 jobs in June, the unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the consensus estimate of 5.6%. The June unemployment rate reading could provide support for the view that the Fed will remain accommodative for longer, which would be a drag on USD, Maybank says. On technical charts, the currency pair's initial support is at 1.3450 and its initial resistance is at 1.3530, Maybank says. USD/SGD is down 0.1% at 1.3462. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com) 

  0649 GMT - Natixis has a modest bearish bias for U.S. dollar and euro government bonds, it says, remaining bullish about risky assets for the second half of the year. Specifically, it is overweight equities versus bonds and versus credit. Natixis also likes emerging-market assets, although it is aware of the vulnerability of emerging markets to tapering risks. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0625 GMT - German Bunds should remain supported amid signs for a renewed bid for euro-duration given fears over rising Covid-19 Delta variant cases, Commerzbank says. ""The constructive market backdrop looks set to extend near term,"" Commerzbank's rates strategist Rainer Guntermann says. He expects Bunds and spreads to remain on firmer footing as this week's government bond supply is set to be relatively low, while the European Central Bank continues its asset purchases. The 10-year Bund yield is trading 0.6 basis points higher at -0.229%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0616 GMT - Societe Generale recommends investors stay long in eurozone periphery government bonds versus the core. While capital gains might be gone for now in these trades, carry should allow Italian and Spanish government bonds to outperform, it says. A carry trade involves borrowing at a low interest rate and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return. In the inflation-linked segment, SocGen recommends reducing allocation to U.S. inflation-linked bonds, or TIPS, to neutral, attributable to volatility which makes these assets less appealing. SocGen remains long in European inflation-linked bonds. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0616 GMT - As the EU continues to build its benchmark curve, Societe Generale finds good value in the five- and 30-year segments. The bank likes to be long in the EU's 30-year bonds versus France and Germany, while the five-year maturity could continue to ""richen""--to become more expensive--, including against swap, it says. The EU's next issuance under the Next Generation EU program could be a seven- or a 15-year bond before the summer break, SocGen says. The next issuance will be the third one after a debut 10-year bond, and five- and 30-year bonds in the second transaction. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

394,"Canada Annual CPI Decelerates to 3.1% in June -- Update

  By Kim Mackrael 

  OTTAWA--Canada's annual inflation rate decelerated in June as the effects of last year's economic reopening contributed to smaller year-over-year price increases compared with prior months. 

  Canada's consumer-price index rose 3.1% on a year-over-year basis in June, Statistics Canada said Wednesday, slower than the 3.6% increase recorded in the previous month. Market expectations were for a 3.2% rise in June, according to economists at TD Securities. 

  On a month-over-month basis, prices climbed 0.3% in June. On a seasonally adjusted basis, CPI rose 0.1% in June from the previous month. 

  Excluding gasoline, headline inflation rose by 2.2% on an annual basis in June, the data agency said. 

  Meanwhile, the average of the Bank of Canada's preferred measures for underlying inflation in June was 2.23%. Core inflation is meant to gauge price changes in items that exclude volatile goods like food and energy. 

  Several economists said the June deceleration should ease concerns about the possibility of a persistent rise in headline inflation. The Bank of Canada said earlier this month that the factors pushing up inflation are largely temporary, such as a rebound in gasoline prices and supply-chain bottlenecks. Officials at the central bank expect inflation to remain above 3% through the second half of 2021 before easing back toward 2% in 2022. 

  ""While the headline rate is still well above the Bank of Canada's 2% target, the deceleration appears to confirm the central bank's view that much of the recent pickup in inflation was transitory,"" CIBC Capital Markets economist Royce Mendes said. 

  The June data used Statistics Canada's recently revised weights in calculating the consumer-price index, reflecting changes in spending patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic by putting more weight on shelter and household furnishings, and less on transportation. The data agency said the headline number for annual inflation wasn't affected by the new weightings. 

  Statistics Canada said the deceleration in June was largely the result of price increases that took place one year earlier, at a time when the economy was reopening after the initial shutdown that began in March 2020 and was meant to curb the spread of Covid-19. Annual inflation data compare current prices with those from a year earlier. 

  In June, shelter prices rose 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and transportation prices increased 5.6%. Price growth slowed the most in the clothing and footwear category, advancing just 1.1% year-over-year, mainly because of lower prices for women's clothing. Gasoline prices also advanced at a slower annual pace in June compared with the previous month.

395,"FDA Lets Pharmacies Substitute Branded Insulin With Knockoff Product, in First for a Biologic Drug

By Joseph Walker 

     For the first time, U.S. regulators have said that a knockoff version of a biologic drug is interchangeable with its branded equivalent, a milestone in the yearslong effort to bring greater competition to the market for expensive biologic drugs. 

     The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said the biosimilar insulin product Semglee is interchangeable with Sanofi SA's Lantus, a designation that allows pharmacists to automatically substitute Semglee for prescriptions for Lantus, one of the top-selling insulins in the world. 

     Semglee is made by Viatris Inc. and Biocon Biologics Ltd. and was first approved by the FDA last year. But doctors would have to specifically prescribe the biosimilar version, rather than allowing pharmacists to substitute it for Lantus when filling the prescription. The companies said they would launch the product with new labeling on interchangeability before the end of the year. 

     A Viatris spokeswoman declined to disclose how much the company will charge for the interchangeable Semglee product. 

     The current list price for a pack of five Lantus injection pens is $425.31, a Sanofi spokeswoman said. When Semglee was originally introduced last year, the companies charged $147.98 per five-pen package. 

     A majority of patients pay $0 or $10 per prescription for Sanofi insulins through the company's copay assistance program, the spokeswoman said. For uninsured patients, the company has a program that allows patients to pay a fixed price of $99 a month. 

     Insulin, a lifesaving medication used to control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes, became a flashpoint in recent years in the debate over rising drug prices. The cost of insulin led some patients, particularly those without health insurance or coverage requiring significant out-of-pocket payments, to ration or skip doses of the medication. 

     In 2010, Congress created a mechanism for drugmakers to develop biosimilar copies of so-called biologic drugs -- made from living cells -- that had lost patent protection. The aim was to create more competition and bring down prices in the same way that generics had for traditional pharmaceuticals made from chemicals. 

     But the biosimilar market hasn't delivered as much cost-savings as policy analysts had hoped, partly because there haven't been any approved biosimilars designated as interchangeable by the FDA. 

     ""This is a momentous day for people who rely daily on insulin for treatment of diabetes, as biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar products have the potential to greatly reduce healthcare costs,"" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. 

     Lantus had second-quarter sales of 637 million euros, equivalent to about $757 million, down 2.7% from the same quarter a year ago, in part because of biosimilar competition. In the U.S., sales rose 6.6% to 237 million euros, or about $282 million, over the same period. 

     The FDA's approval of Semglee as interchangeable is an important step to creating competition and affordable insulin, but there is still a long way to go, said David Mitchell, founder of Patients For Affordable Drugs, a lobbying and advocacy group. 

     ""Semglee offers an alternative for only a fraction of the diabetes community -- we need competition from interchangeable, less expensive options for all modern forms of insulin,"" Mr. Mitchell said in a statement. 

     The interchangeability designation for Semglee may not have as much of an impact on the insulin market as the FDA hopes, said Bernstein & Co. analyst Ronny Gal. There are already several long-acting insulin products on the market that doctors and patients view as equivalent, and drugmakers have created ways to bring down patient copays in recent years amid scrutiny from lawmakers and the media, Mr. Gal said. 

     Pharmacists typically only substitute cheaper drugs when a patient's insurance encourages them to do so, said Mr. Gal. In the case of insulin, insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers have kept tight control of which products patients receive because they can obtain larger rebates and discounts by guaranteeing their market share to particular products, he said. 

     But the FDA's first approval of an interchangeable product is a positive signal that the agency is willing to grant the designation to future biosimilars where insurers may be willing to allow for substitution, said Mr. Gal. 

     ""It's important looking forward to other markets where interchangeability is more important,"" said Mr. Gal. ""In the context of insulin, it is a minor market development.""

396,"Glynn&apos;s Take: Economic Case for Reopening Australia to the World Is Getting Louder

 
   By James Glynn 
 

  SYDNEY--The economic case for reopening Australia's international border to skilled workers is gaining increasing momentum, but as lockdowns keep shuttering major cities, the politically prickly issue might not be acted upon with any vigor until after the next federal election that is due within the next year. 

  That sets the stage for a potential clash of wills between the businesses that are eager to cash in on the stunning economic recovery over the last year, and the federal and state governments wanting to avoid the backlash that will surely come if the pandemic is given a fresh wind. 

  One figure that is emerging as a torch bearer for starting to open the border is Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Philip Lowe, who warned Thursday that investment and productivity could suffer if businesses are unable to start tapping the international job market for skilled workers soon. 

  Ironically, it is also Mr. Lowe who is leading the charge for higher wages and inflation in Australia, something that a closed international border could help deliver much faster. It's just that the head of the central bank doesn't want higher wages and inflation to come at the cost of lost investment opportunities, as frustrated businesses scratch in the dirt for skilled employees. 

  ""If borders remain completely closed and we can't get workers into the country that are needed for firms to expand and invest, I think we will see more wages growth. Some people might think that's a good thing, but on the other hand, we will see less investment,"" he told a conference of economists. 

  Mr. Lowe described the border closure as a ""first-order"" issue for policy makers, noting that there has been a sharp jump in job vacancies--especially in the accommodation and food-services sector--while the labor pool needed to meet demand has cratered. 

  While some of these vacancies could have been filled by people on visas, this has become more difficult. Since March 2020, the number of people in Australia on a visa with the right to work has dropped by more than 250,000, he said. 

  Mr. Lowe said that if the international border remains closed for an extended period ""pressure points"" could build within the economy. 

  Closing the country's doors to contain the spread of the pandemic has proven to be largely effective and politically popular. So throwing them back open could prove disastrous for sitting governments, especially if more contagious variants of the virus are unleashed. Such an event would be political death for any government, whether state, federal, conservative or progressive. 

  There are many thousands of Australian citizens overseas that can't return home as they wish due to government-mandated intake quotas. Australia has also been sluggish in rolling out vaccines, making the border issue even more acute. 

  The country can do some things in the interim to ease the pressure on its job market, such as giving more work hours to those who want them, while increased flexibility via measures such as working from home might boost participation. 

  But an aging population poses an obstacle, and, more immediately, so does the reality that skills mismatches will inevitably become common. 

  While there is no plan to put out the welcome mat for foreign workers, there is some probing of what might be done to start normalizing things. The federal government said recently that it plans to experiment with shorter isolation periods for vaccinated travelers and the gradual return of foreign students to help two of the most affected industries, education and tourism. 

  But some health experts worry that the government's push to nudge the door open wider is premature as Australia has only fully vaccinated around 6% of its population and the Delta variant is spreading in ways that scientists don't yet fully understand. Increased risks from the Delta variant have already prompted a 50% cut to the number of people allowed to arrive in Australia on commercial flights. 

  What is certain is that the intensifying debate over the international border will shape much of Australia's immediate political and economic outlook.

397,"Costs Weigh Down Wind-Turbine Makers -- WSJ

By Jennifer Hiller and Katherine Blunt 

     The world's appetite for green energy is greater than ever, but that isn't translating into big profits for some of the companies behind the boom. 

     Top wind-turbine makers are struggling with lower earnings as rising raw- material costs, problems shipping the hulking machines, and uncertainty over the future of U.S. subsidies pressure their businesses. 

     Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA and Vestas Wind Systems A/S, two of the largest global manufacturers, reduced profit forecasts for the remainder of the year. General Electric Co., another leading turbine manufacturer, reported year-over-year growth in turbine sales but hasn't turned a profit in that segment this year. 

     Globally, wind production has been growing as the renewable energy source becomes more economically competitive with fossil fuel sources of electricity such as coal and natural gas and as countries begin taking steps to address the causes of climate change. 

     Demand for turbines this decade is expected to be roughly double demand in the previous 10 years, according to estimates from the consulting and data firm Wood Mackenzie. But companies face an array of challenges in manufacturing and moving the increasingly large turbines, whose blades alone span more than 100 feet apiece. 

     A quadrupling of transportation costs and increases in steel, copper, aluminum and carbon fiber prices will likely drive wind-turbine prices up by 10% over the next 12 to 18 months, according to Wood Mackenzie. 

     ""There is a logistics challenge in major harbors in the world due to Covid lockdowns,"" said Vestas Chief Executive Henrik Andersen. ""You have a very high number of container ships and specially designed ships transporting our finished assets. They are held in queues. They can't get access to the harborside."" 

     Prices for the raw materials used in wind turbines started moving higher in mid-2020 as many pandemic restrictions eased globally, and those elevated costs are likely to last, Mr. Andersen said. But the transportation-price increases should eventually drop, he added, saying Vestas expects them to last through the start of 2022. Vestas shares have fallen around 15% this year. 

     Higher oil prices this year have boosted the cost of the fuels used to move wind-turbine supplies and equipment. At the same time, the turbines are getting larger and more complex to transport, said David Sale, chief executive of Goldwind Americas, the North American subsidiary of Chinese turbine maker Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co. 

     ""As we continue to push the boundaries of transportation, the specialized equipment that's required to move these machines is not abundant,"" Mr. Sale said. 

     Another major factor weighing on turbine makers is a lack of clarity on whether and how the Biden administration will extend a federal tax credit for wind development in the U.S., a key growth market. The extension of the tax credit, set to expire this year, is being considered as part of a $3.5 trillion budget-reconciliation bill that proposes a number of spending measures to accelerate renewable-energy deployment. 

     With the details of U.S. subsidies in flux, some customers are unsure of whether to order new turbines now or wait to see if policies and potentially lower shipping costs make the purchases more attractive in the near future, analysts and companies said. 

     Abby Watson, Siemens Gamesa's head of government affairs in North America, said she is optimistic that the industry will have a clearer long-term picture of U.S. policy by the end of the year. That, she said, would help the company better plan its manufacturing strategy without having to ramp up and down in response to tax-code changes. 

     ""When we talk about price pressures that everyone has been dealing with, a not-insignificant part of that is inconsistency in policy,"" she said. 

     Siemens Gamesa, whose shares have fallen roughly 25% this year, said it is charging higher prices and taking other measures to offset the increase in raw-material costs. Though the company warned that the challenges will likely continue in the near term, it forecasts strong growth in coming years as governments around the world set carbon-reduction targets. 

     General Electric said that it expects the U.S. onshore-wind market to decline in the near term before stabilizing, in part because a potential long-term extension of wind-tax credits could cause wind-farm developers to push out their investment decisions for years. 

     In a statement, the company said it sees long-term growth in the global wind industry as the technology becomes more competitive with other forms of power generation and as governments in the U.S. and elsewhere work to address climate change. 

     For now, turbine manufacturers largely must swallow higher logistics costs, said Deepa Venkateswaran, senior renewables analyst at Bernstein Research. Fixed-price contracts typically include a margin for inflation, she said, but it wasn't enough of a cushion this time. 

     ""The bottlenecks cannot be immediately passed on,"" Ms. Venkateswaran said.

398,"Lumber Prices Have Fallen Back to Earth. Don&apos;t Expect House Prices to Get Cheaper. -- Barrons.com

By Simon Constable 

     The lumber bubble is over. Prices likely will stay rangebound for the foreseeable future as supply increases and demand from home builders remains robust. 

     ""We expect prices to hover between $500 and $600 per 1,000 board feet,"" says Samuel Burman, a commodities economist at independent research firm Capital Economics. 

     Lumber futures have been on a roller-coaster ride because restricted wood supplies from sawmills met with increased demand for the material to construct homes. That combination sent prices for random-length lumber futures contracts on the CME to all-time highs around $1,671 in May, up from $495 in late October. They were fetching $530 recently. 

     Now that the bubble has popped, the market will likely stabilize, neither rallying nor falling substantially. ""We think the market is at the right level now,"" says Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors. Investors might want to step aside from taking a directional bet on prices over the next few months. 

     Alternatively, risk-tolerant traders might consider an options straddle strategy that would take advantage of a static market. For instance, try selling a November-dated call option that would pay out if the November-dated futures contract price rises above $605, and a put option that pays out if the price falls below $405. If the price remains within the $405-to-$650 range until the option expires, then investors keep the option sale price, recently around $7,601. 

     It's the interaction of increased supplies and continued solid demand that will help keep prices in a range. Last year lumber supplies were tight due to the pandemic restrictions. That's quickly reversing because even after the recent crash, wood prices are high compared with the past decade, when they mostly remained below $400. 

     ""The lumber mills are still making really good money, so they won't shut down supply,"" Hackett says. It's likely that sawmill operators will increase supply and take advantage of falling unemployment benefits to hire more workers. 

     Separately, demand for housing remains high relative to available homes. The past decade of low housing construction has led to a housing shortage. Single-family housing starts should average around 1.2 million next year, up from one million this year, according to forecasts from Capital Economics. That compares favorably to the annual rate of less than a million throughout the period from August 2007 to November 2019, according to government data. ""We expect demand for new homes to remain strong,"" Burman says. 

     There are risks with this trade. A potential supply disruption is coming from Canada after a U.S. government report recommended raising tariffs on Canadian lumber to 18% from 9%, alleging the Canadian forestry industry benefits from government subsidies. 

     The likelihood of such a move is probably dependent on prices falling significantly from current levels down to less than $250, which would be below the past decade's average price, Burman says. ""If prices are relatively high, there is no need to prop up the southern states,"" he says. 

     Poor weather could also cause home-construction delays. ""It is easier to build when it is sunny and dry; when it's wet, there are delays,"" Burman says. 

     However, the largest risk is in selling options. If prices of lumber futures fail to remain within the $405-to-$650 range, traders could lose more money than the sale price of the options. For that reason, be prepared to exit the trade quickly if the economic outlook changes. 

     Still, given the likely prevailing economic scenario over the next few weeks, the probable rewards seem worth the risks.

399,"Market Talk Roundup: BOE Leaves Policy Unchanged

  The Bank of England voted unanimously to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.1% and voted 7-1 to maintaining the BOE's government bond-buying target at 875 billion pounds, with one member prefering to stop puchases immediately. The central bank expects inflation to increase further but predicts this rise will be temporary. The BOE lowered the interest-rate threshold for reducing its stock of bonds to 0.5% from 1.5% previously and hinted at future monetary-policy tightening, although analysts say this is still likely to be some way off. Below is a selection of analysts' comments. 

 

  BOE Decision Seen Lacking Surprises to Move Pound 

 

  1432 GMT - The Bank of England's policy statement on Thursday lacked any surprises that could materially move sterling, TD Securities says. The BOE changed its forward guidance to say some modest monetary policy tightening may be necessary over the forecast period but the central bank is ""hardly breaking any ground relative to its peers,"" TD forex strategist Ned Rumpeltin says. ""The MPC is taking further steps toward the exit, but they remain incremental and carefully calibrated."" Since the meeting failed to provide a ""strong directional cue"" for sterling, the currency will remain driven by risk sentiment in the near term with market attention likely to pivot towards July's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, he says. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Likely to Remain Patient on Raising Rates 

 

  1341 GMT - The Bank of England on Thursday suggested it may have moved closer to tightening monetary policy but the case for a wait-and-see approach remains strong, EY Item Club says. ""Covid-19 uncertainty has not gone away and time is needed to assess the persistence, or otherwise, of higher inflation and how the economy copes with the end of the furlough scheme and other government support in the autumn,"" EY economic advisor Martin Beck says. EY continues to expect the BOE to start raising rates in late 2022 when it sees the economy returning to its ""pre-pandemic trajectory,"" he says. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Unlikely to Unwind Balance Sheet Until 2024 

 

  1329 GMT - The Bank of England's reduction of the interest rate threshold to start unwinding the size of its balance sheet removes a hurdle, but the central bank is unlikely to start reducing its gilts holdings until 2024, says J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""The hurdle for unwinding the size of the balance sheet has been moved substantially lower,"" Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""While at face value the Bank's desire to communicate its plans to reduce its Gilt holdings could be read as a hawkish signal, market pricing still suggests that the 0.5% interest rate threshold won't be reached until 2024 at the earliest. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

 

  UK Policy Rate Rise Could Be 'Unavoidable' 

 

  1330 GMT - An interest rate rise by the Bank of England may be on the cards in the not-too-distant future, says Derrick Dunne, chief executive of YOU Asset Management. Whilst the current bank rate of 0.1% ""could well be with us for the rest of the year, the continued economic recovery is enough to convince us that U.K. inflation--transitory though it may be--will not be allowed to rise unchecked,"" he says. With the central bank predicting that inflation could rise as high as 4% this year, ""a rate-based reaction may soon be unavoidable,"" he says.(lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE's Balance Sheet Unwind Still Way Off, Says ING 

 

  1301 GMT - While the Bank of England's plan to reduce its gilt holdings has the potential to be a little quicker than expected, it's still some way off, says ING. ""The speed of unwind has the potential to be a little quicker than we might have expected, assuming the Bank were to immediately stop all reinvestments - and indeed ultimately sell bonds back into the market,"" the Dutch bank says. However, the BOE plans to start unwinding its balance sheet when the policy rate reaches 0.5%, which ING doesn't expect until late 2023. Similarly, interest rates haven't reached 1% since the Global Financial Crisis, pushing further out the possibility of selling gilts back into the market. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Prioritizes QE in Policy Normalization 

 

  1250 GMT - The Bank of England has given quantitative easing an important role in normalizing monetary policy, setting off on a different path from other central banks, says Gurpreet Gill, macro strategist, global fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. ""The BOE has diverged from other major central banks in its proposed choreography of the policy exit sequence, deciding that a reduction in the size of its balance sheet will play an important role in policy normalization,"" she says. Commencing once the policy rate is increased to a fairly low level of 0.5%, it suggests the BOE ""will be patient on the rate hike front given the relatively active role of balance sheet management."" (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Unlikely to Tighten Policy Until Mid-2023 

 

  1242 GMT - The Bank of England's policy statement on Thursday signalled an interest rate rise is on the horizon but it's likely to sit tight until mid-2023 before taking such action, Capital Economics says. ""While the Bank is starting to signal that policy will be tightened, it's not suggesting it's going to be tightened soon,"" Capital Economics economist Ruth Gregory says. ""What's more, we think inflation will be a bit lower next year than the Bank expects, which suggests policy won't be tightened until mid-2023, rather than the mid-2022 date priced into the markets."" (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Prepares Markets For 'Very Gradual Tapering' 

 

  1225 GMT - The Bank of England's latest monetary policy announcement is preparing markets for ""very gradual tapering of monetary support,"" Luke Bartholomew, senior monetary economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, says. The central bank on the one hand is ""relatively relaxed about the medium-term inflation outlook"" but on the other signals possible rate rises in coming years if the economy grows as strongly as it expects, Bartholomew says. This message of preparing markets for slow monetary-policy tightening is consistent with a number of other global central banks, he says. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Decision Seen Lacking Surprises to Materially Move Pound 

 

  1212 GMT - The pound was ""quite choppy"" after the Bank of England's policy decision Thursday but isn't trading too far from where it was beforehand as the central bank didn't announce anything overly surprising, Oanda says. ""Ultimately, there was nothing shocking from the Monetary Policy Committee, with Michael Saunders the lone dissenter on asset purchases, preferring to end new purchases as soon as possible and cap bond purchases at GBP830 billion, rather than the current target of GBP875 billion,"" Oanda analyst Craig Erlam says. ""Given that some expected a 6-2 vote, this is actually a slightly dovish outcome."" However, the vast majority of policymakers still support a cautious approach, he says. GBP/USD is last at 1.3924 and EUR/GBP is at 0.8515. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

 

  BOE Hints at Earlier Quantitative Tightening, Slower Rate Rises 

 

  1201 GMT - Bank of England officials have effectively decided to bring forward the unwinding of past asset purchases, says BlackRock Investment Institute. ""It [the BOE] now thinks it can start this quantitative tightening (QT) by ceasing reinvestment of maturing gilts when the policy rate reaches 0.5%, instead of 1.5% previously,"" says Vivek Paul, UK chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute. This implies it now expects the next policy tightening cycle to be far more gradual, however, and Paul expects the first rate rise in the first half of 2023, slightly later than markets have been expecting, and start to unwind asset purchases from 2025. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

 

  UK 10Y Gilt Yield Briefly Rises After BOE Rate Decision 

 

  1134 GMT - The yield on the U.K. 10-year benchmark government briefly hits an intra-day high of 0.535%, according to Tradeweb, before turning back lower after the Bank of England's rate policy decision. The Monetary Policy Committee judged that ""should the economy evolve broadly in line with the central projections in the August Monetary Policy Report, some modest tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period is likely to be necessary to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably in the medium term."" The MPC voted unanimously to keep the bank rate steady at 0.1%, while a majority of 7-1 voted to maintain the current target of gilt purchases at GBP875 billion. The 10-year gilt yield last trades at 0.514%. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

 

  Sterling Struggles For Direction After Rate Decision 

 

  1133 GMT - Sterling struggles for direction after the Bank of England voted unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.1% and voted 7-1 to leave its bond-buying target at GBP875 billion. Some analysts were expecting a 6-2 vote on maintaining the bond-buying program. The BOE said it expects annual inflation to reach 4% in the final quarter of the year but should slow to its 2% target in the next two to three years. GBP/USD initially rose to 1.3943 after the decision from 1.3925 beforehand, before falling back to 1.3918. EUR/GBP briefly hits a one-week low of 0.8496, before rising to 0.8515, having traded at 0.8509 beforehand, according to FactSet.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)

401,"The Chip Shortage Looks Like the Oil Shortage of the 1970s. What It Means for Stocks and the Economy. -- Barrons.com

By Al Root 

     Semiconductors might be the new oil -- and that could make the 2020s the new 1970s. 

     Back then, the world ran on oil -- and any change in supply had a massive impact on demand. When OPEC embargoed the U.S. in the 1970s, the price of crude rose from about $3 a barrel at the beginning of the decade to $13 a barrel by its end. The U.S. even issued gas ration coupons in 1974. 

     The spike was good news for Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which returned roughly 100% and 70%, respectively, in the 1970s, but painful for everyone else, as inflation raged. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 17% and 5%, respectively, over the decade. 

     If oil was the necessary component for the 1970s economy, chips provide the same function in the 2020s. They power everything from our computers and phones to our cars and appliances. And, as everyone knows by now, there is a shortage, with delivery times growing to more than 20 weeks, per Susquehanna Financial Group data. 

     Roughly 80% of all the chips in the world are made in Northeast Asia. Politicians realize how big a problem this is, and they have started to demand local manufacturing, with President Joe Biden introducing a plan for $50 billion in chip research earlier this year. Reshoring any industry, including semiconductors, is a yearslong process that requires billions in capital. There will be winners and losers. And if it goes on too long, it will filter into the prices of all kinds of goods. 

     ""Shortages related to rapid upswings in demand could become inflationary, "" TS Lombard's Rory Green and Steven Blitz wrote back in January, when the scarcity of chips -- ""a product more known for steadily declining prices"" -- was in its infancy. 

     The global semiconductor shortage has been a particular thorn in the side of the automotive industry all year. It was supposed to resolve itself by the second half of 2021. But more production cuts announced by Toyota Motor (TM) this past week shows the problem isn't going away soon. In fact, RBC analyst Joseph Spak argues the shortage could last for years. 

     Part of the problem is structural, Spak says. Electric vehicles need more computing power, but the auto industry typically relies on older-generation chip technology, where capacity isn't being as readily added by chip makers. Instead, they prefer to focus on newer, higher-end chips for the consumer electronics industry. 

     The result: Instead of lines at the gas stations, there are lines at the automotive dealerships. Low new- and used-car inventories have pushed up pricing and contributed to rising inflation. Used-car prices rose about 20% in the first half of 2021, while new-car prices rose about 3%. The rise in used-car prices has started to slow, but new-car price gains are accelerating, rising about 7% year over year in July. 

     That's not good for consumers, but auto makers stand to benefit. Constrained production will lead to persistently low inventories and higher pricing. Companies will sell fewer cars, but that's been offset by higher prices. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) shares are up 43% and 17%, respectively, in 2021, and both still trade for about seven times 2022 earnings. 

     And that's just the auto industry. The longer the chip shortage goes on, the more prices will rise in all types of products. That will benefit chip makers such as Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Wall Street sees upside in the latter. Some two-thirds of analysts covering the stock rate it Buy, and the average price target implies about a 33% upside. 

     Don't expect long lines outside RadioShack, but expect the chip shortage to be felt just the same.

402,"Transcript: Fed Chief Powell&apos;s Postmeeting Press -2-

     So the question is really on the maximum-employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate, 50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress. Many on the committee feel that the substantial further progress test for employment has been met. Others feel that it's close. They want to see a little more progress. There's a range of perspectives. 

     I guess my own view would be that the test, the substantial further progress test for employment, is all but met. And so once we've met those two tests, once the committee decides that they've met, and that could come as soon as the next meeting -- that's the purpose of that language is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting -- the committee will consider that test and we'll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper. 

     Q: Thanks, Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. 

     So looking at the steps, we have now, basically, four years of inflation above target and policy never gets to the long-run rate. I'm wondering if you could address that from two perspectives, one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year, and second, from the perspective of the average household that's now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when for some this year real wages have actually gone down. 

     MR. POWELL: Sure. So as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the out years and that's really, I think, a reflection of -- and they've moved up significantly for this year -- and that's, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being -- that we're seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. 

     So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation is going to be higher this year and a number -- you know, I guess, the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up but just by a couple of tenths. 

     Those are very modest overshoots. You're looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years -- two years and three years out. These are very, very -- I don't think that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot. That just happens to be people's forecasts. You know, we want to -- we want to foster a strong labor market and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we're very much on track to achieve those things. 

     In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want and we're -- that's really the ultimate test of whether we're getting this done under the framework and, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent. I wouldn't put -- I wouldn't put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and '24 -- one-tenth in '24. But you're right, those are the numbers. 

     Q: Chair Powell -- thank you, Michelle. 

     Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I'm wondering what the contours of that debate have been. For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase? Or is it about financial stability risks or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? 

     Thank you. 

     MR. POWELL: So let me say that there's very broad support on the committee for this plan both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote today, and I'd say quite, quite broad support for this approach. You're correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner and they've made their arguments publicly. For some of them, it's a financial stability concern and for others it's other concerns. They can make their own -- make their own arguments. 

     This is -- this is an approach that the committee will, broadly, support and it will -- it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate. You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the -- in the early stages of the crisis, they were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets. 

     Then as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do, and now we're in a situation where they still have a use but it's time for us to begin to taper them. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework -- the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go and, again, broad support on the committee. 

     Q: Hi, Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal. 

     Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just to taper, may be closer at hand. Does the committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you've articulated, or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do? 

     MR. POWELL: Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper, and the taper takes some months in everyone's figuring, so you're going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it is -- it's what we adopted last September. It's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, and while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market's very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market and we think that those imbalances will sort themselves out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve moderately higher inflation, over 2 percent -- you know, that really depends on the path of inflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff. 

     So I just think -- if you look at what people are writing down for year and 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates, and that's only one indicator but it suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they're writing down, in good faith, what they see as meeting the test. There's a range of perspectives about where the economy will be. But, by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023, so it's not really an unusually wide array of views about this. 

     Q: Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year, and I wonder if you thought those were appropriate. 

     MR. POWELL: So no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. 

     So let me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission, and that's why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business. One of those is -- sort of three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictions: one is ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that's bank securities and other things; secondly, there are times when we're not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets, and that's the period immediately before or during an FOMC meeting; and third, there's regular disclosure. 

     So all of these -- everyone's, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis, so, you know, I would have to go back and read people's financial disclosures to know what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you'd say it's served us well. The other thing you would say -- that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public's trust in us. We need to make changes and we're going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review. We're going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards. 

     Q: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

     I want to follow up on Jeanna's question. The issue of ownership of these stocks and trades, do you think it's appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying? Is that one of the modifications that you're looking at? And in that these -- you said yourself they're clearly not seen as appropriate. In that the Fed's code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of conflict, do those trades, in fact, and holdings violate the Fed's code of conduct? Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might be done with your review? Thank you, sir. 

     MR. POWELL: Don't have a timeline yet. We can start with that.

403,"An Inexpensive Builder Stock In a Hot Market -- Barron&apos;s

  Taylor Morrison Home trails its peers, but rising prices and fatter margins make it a value play 

By Daren Fonda 

     Buyers looking for a new house may need to throw their name in a hat and hope to win the lottery. Taylor Morrison Home , a builder based in Arizona, is holding drawings for purchases in hot markets like Austin, Texas, and Phoenix. Prime home lots are selling for $50,000 premiums in auctions. ""We're in a very strong market,"" says Taylor CEO Sheryl Palmer. 

     Home-builder stocks are up 37% this year, reflecting dizzying demand, ultralow mortgage rates, and maddening construction delays. Just 34,000 completed new homes were on the market in July, well below the 87,300 average for the month since 1973. Bidding wars have broken out, including camp-outs where buyers set up umbrellas and barbecues on the sidewalk, waiting to be first in line for a new house, says BTIG analyst Carl Reichardt. 

     If there's still a value play, it may be Taylor Morrison's own stock (ticker: TMHC). It's up just 10% this year and has gained less than half the 97% industry average over the past three years. Taylor trades around book value, compared with 1.8 times book for the industry. At a recent price of $28, it goes for 4.3 times estimated 2022 earnings, a 30% discount to peers. 

     The discount looks excessive. While Taylor isn't the most profitable builder, it's taking measures to lift returns. The company has pledged to boost gross margins on home-sale closings, from 20% in 2021 to 22% next year, and it's aiming for a 20% return on equity, up from the high teens now. Taylor is streamlining floor plans to cut construction costs. And the company controls 76,000 lots, including raw land and plots under development. It plans for nearly 400 communities with houses for sale by year-end 2022, up from 330 in 2021. 

     ""The stock is inexpensive,"" says Reichardt, who sees it hitting $38 over the next year. ""It's a call option on the company improving efficiencies and margins. The market doesn't believe Taylor will do that, but there's a large margin of safety in the stock."" 

     The country's No. 5 builder, Taylor focuses on West Coast and Sunbelt markets, many with healthy population growth. Under Palmer, CEO since 2007, Taylor has bought five builders over the past seven years, including AV Homes in 2018 and William Lyon Homes in 2020. The acquisitions have expanded Taylor's geographic reach and product line to include entry-level, move-up, and ""active adult"" homes -- typically in age-restricted developments for people over 55. 

     Taylor's average closing price hit $503,000 in the June quarter, up from $458,000 last year. Houses that sold in the quarter for future delivery are averaging $597,000. Its order backlog has been growing, reaching 10,228 in June. 

     Palmer says demand has cooled from a ""frenzied"" spring, but she's still expecting healthy sales throughout the year. The biggest obstacle now: finding labor and materials. Lumber prices remain elevated, despite dropping sharply from the spring. Lead times for windows have more than doubled, she says, and everything from garage doors to flooring is arriving later than usual. ""It's like playing double-fisted Whac-A-Mole, "" she says of the sourcing effort. 

     Taylor aims to close 14,500 to 15,000 homes this year, up 18% from 2020. Growth is likely to slow next year to 1%, according to consensus estimates, and Taylor's backlog of signed house contracts is expected to fall slightly. But with prices on the rise, and Taylor working to lift margins, profits should rise. Consensus analyst estimates have Taylor earning $5.13 a share this year and $6.60 in 2022. 

     Why does the stock look so cheap? Investors worry that the industry's fuel -- low rates, big job gains, and a shift to the exurbs -- won't last. Escalating prices are pressuring affordability and may push out first-time buyers. 

     For Taylor, investors may be leery of more acquisitions. Builders often overpay and then take accounting hits on inflated land values, says Reichardt. Palmer says ""synergies"" from the Lyon deal should start to materialize over the next few months and that she has ""no plans"" for acquisitions. 

     Investors may also be skeptical of Taylor's margin targets. The builder doesn't dominate any local market or product niche, says Reichardt, who calls it a ""tweener,"" lacking the purchasing power of larger builders. ""A lot of margin improvement is driven by depth of local market share,"" he says. ""They don't have that."" Palmer says that Taylor is a top-five builder in many markets and she has ""tremendous confidence"" about hitting the 22% target. 

     Investors aren't paying much to give her the benefit of the doubt. Alex Barron, an independent analyst and head of the Housing Research Center, estimates that Taylor's book value will rise from $27 to $31 over the next year. Strip out $5 a share in goodwill, or intangible assets, and it would be worth $26 in a liquidation, he says, pegging the stock at $45 in a bull case. ""The upside/downside is very compelling compared to other builders,"" he says. 

     Wedbush Securities' Jay McCanless likes the margin story and sees earnings reaching $6.58 a share in 2022. Even if the stock achieves a peer multiple of six times his earnings-per-share forecast, it would trade at $39, below his $46 target. ""The earnings potential and pricing power are there,"" he says. If he's right, investors may have a winning lottery ticket, too.

405,"Nasdaq Futures Down 1.3%, Oil and Yields Surge -- and What Else Is Happening in the Stock Market Today -- Barrons.com

By Jack Denton 

     Wall Street was set for a downbeat open Tuesday as global investors worried over economic growth and inflation, sending bond yields higher and helping commodity prices hit decade highs. 

     Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated an open 130 points lower, after the index rose 71 points Monday to close at 34,869. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also indicated a weak start to Tuesday trading, with futures for the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 down 1.3%. 

     Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 0.2%, in line with other Asian stocks outside of China, where industrial production is under pressure from a power crunch and economic growth prospects are downbeat. Both Goldman Sachs and Nomura downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth in 2021. 

     The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 1.4% lower. 

     Investor attention is focused on inflation concerns, which has sent bond yields surging. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 1.53% early Tuesday, with the 30-year yield pushing past the 2% milestone to 2.06%. 

     Higher bond yields are putting pressure in particular on technology stocks, with the Nasdaq underperforming other indexes Monday and set for a repeat Tuesday. Elevated yields as well as higher interest rates typically lower the current value of future cash flows, hitting high-growth technology companies that expect significant profits in years to come. 

     Also read:  The Stock Market Has Put China Evergrande Concerns Behind It. Why That's a Mistake. 

     Later, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will address lawmakers, along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Prereleased comments showed Powell will warn the Fed may have to raise rates if inflation becomes more persistent than anticipated. 

     ""U.S. 20-year and 30-year paper is yielding the most since July, both above 2%, whilst the benchmark 10-year note has jumped above the psychologically important 1.5% level to 1.53%, its highest since June,"" said Neil Wilson, an analyst at broker Markets.com. 

     ""Bets on central banks tightening monetary policy more swiftly than previously thought are fueling the selling in rates as investors also focus in on the wrangling in Washington over the U.S. debt ceiling,"" Wilson added.

     Commodity markets continued their tear, with the Dow Jones Commodity Index -- which is a broad measure of the commodity futures market -- up 1.3% to the highest levels seen in the last 10 years. 

     The international benchmark for oil futures, Brent, rose 0.8% to near $80 a barrel. U.S. crude futures were similarly higher to around $76.20. 

     The political debate over the U.S. debt ceiling and looming government shutdown added even more black clouds to Tuesday's horizon. 

     Here are six stocks on the move Tuesday: 

     Sanofi (SAN.France) rose 1% in Paris, as it announced it would halt the development of its mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. 

     Rising crude prices continues to boost major oil companies, with BP (BP.U.K.) rising 2% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA.U.K.) climbing 2.7% in London, and TotalEnergies (TTE.France) lifting 1% in Paris. 

     EasyJet (EZJ.U.K.) fell 2.5%, after the company reported that its GBP1.2 billion ($1.6 billion) rights issue was 93% subscribed. 

     Ford (FORD) was 2.7% higher in the U.S. premarket, set to continue climbing after a 2.8% jump Monday. The automotive giant has been boosted by rising bond yields, and on Monday announced the largest single manufacturing investment in its 118-year history, with $11.4 billion in spending to boost electric-vehicle battery manufacturing.

406,"Commodities: Demand for Natural Gas Will Keep Prices High -- Barron&apos;s

By Myra P. Saefong 

     Natural-gas prices reached their highest levels in more than seven years thanks to a slow recovery in Gulf of Mexico production after an August hurricane, and strong U.S. exports and tight supplies. 

     A global effort to limit carbon emissions has meant more demand for natural gas and renewable energy, says Troy Vincent, market analyst at commodity market data provider DTN. 

     Recent weakness in wind generation in Europe, coupled with low natural gas inventory ahead of winter, has caused natural gas and electricity prices ""across the continent to shoot to record highs,"" he says. That follows months of high temperatures in East Asia and delays in bringing nuclear generation back online in Japan. 

     Surging demand in Europe, Asia and Latin America for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has led to record high U.S. exports this year, helping push U.S. natural gas futures to their highest since February 2014, he says. 

     Front-month natural-gas futures settled at $5.46 per million British thermal units on Sept. 15, the highest since February 2014. Prices have more than doubled for the year, trading 115% higher year to date. 

     The record pace of U.S. LNG exports this year shows just how tight the global natural-gas market is, and ""how fearful Eastern Asian and European nations are of running short of supply this winter amid heating season,"" Vincent says. 

     In 2020, U.S. natural gas exports reached a record high, according to the Energy Information Administration. Exports may increase by 20% to 25% this year, says Bryan Benoit, national managing partner, energy, at Grant Thornton. 

     Meanwhile, warm 2021 summer months resulted in a more significant increase in demand and the price of natural gas, he says. There's also a need to replenish inventories to prepare for the winter heating season. 

     Working gas in U.S. storage, the amount available to the marketplace, has fallen to its lowest level for this time of year since 2018. As of the week ended Sept. 3, working gas in storage stood at 2.9 trillion cubic feet, well below both a year ago and the five-year average. 

     U.S. inventories may peak in October at around 3.4 trillion cubic feet, which would still be about 10% below the prior five-year average for the period, says Vincent. 

     Extreme weather remains an issue with over two months left in an Atlantic hurricane season that's already disrupted Gulf energy operations. 

     Hurricane Ida hit the Gulf Coast on Aug. 29. As of Sept. 15, 39% of the region's natural-gas production remained offline, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. 

     Steve Craig, chief energy analyst at Elliott Wave International, refers to events like Ida as ""exogenous"" -- outside factors that can have a temporary impact on price that's ""irrelevant to the larger price trend."" 

     Based on technical analysis known as the Elliott Wave Principle, Craig says the ""big picture"" outlook for natural-gas futures is for significantly higher prices. 

     In spite of some periods of downward consolidation and changes in weather, he says he'll remain ""big-picture bullish"" until the price wave pattern ""dictates a change,"" as it did in July 2020, when prices traded above $1.896, triggering Elliott Wave International's forecast for a rally that could take prices to $4.929. 

     Vincent, however, says that while global demand will remain strong heading into winter -- drawing more LNG shipments from the U.S. and leading to smaller-than-normal seasonal inventory builds -- natural-gas prices may fall from current highs if there's a shift to coal and fuel oil. 

     Prices will still likely hold above $4, however, before easing lower amid rising production next spring, he says.

407,"Retail Sales Rise, Showing Resilient U.S. Consumers -- 3rd Update

By David Harrison 

     Americans stepped up their spending in September, a sign of resilient demand and rising inflation as consumers head into the holiday shopping season. 

     Sales at retail stores, restaurants and online sellers rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. The rise in sales reflects persistently strong demand and higher consumer prices. 

     Consumers, armed with stimulus payments and rising wages, have stepped up spending this year, shrugging off the Delta variant of Covid-19, the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and emerging supply constraints. The retail sales, which aren't adjusted for inflation, rose 13.9% in September from a year earlier. Consumer inflation increased 5.4% in that time, according to the Labor Department. 

     Still, economists see some reasons for concern in the months ahead, including supply chain disruptions causing backlogs and pushing up prices further, a slowing labor market recovery and anxious consumers. 

     ""The shipping bottlenecks will become more of an issue in November and December when you have that spike in holiday-related sales,"" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC. 

     So far, consumers have proven resilient. Retail spending in the first week of October was up 8.8% compared with the average week in September, according to data from Earnest Research, which tracks credit- and debit-card purchases. 

     Barclays PLC economists see consumer spending -- both in goods and services -- rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3% in the fourth quarter from the third. The bank sees a 1.3% growth rate in the third quarter. 

     ""There should be some momentum going into the holiday season,"" said Pooja Sriram, a U.S. economist at Barclays. 

     Several rounds of government stimulus have left households sitting on roughly $1.6 trillion in savings, representing 9.4% of their disposable income, well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Commerce Department. Private-sector hourly wages were up 4.6% in September over the previous year, according to the Labor Department. 

     Friday's report led IHS Markit to raise its economic growth forecasts to 1.6% from 1.4% for the third quarter and to 5.4% from 5.1% for the fourth quarter. 

     Increased spending in September contrasted with shoppers' view of the economy dimming. An index of consumer sentiment fell in October to 71.4 from 72.8 in September, the University of Michigan reported Friday. Americans worried about rising prices, product shortages, the labor market, the Delta variant and the ongoing debate on Capitol Hill over infrastructure and social spending, said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. 

     Meanwhile, the backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing. Dozens of ships remain anchored off the coast, waiting to be unloaded at U.S. ports. Containers are piled up in warehouses waiting to be shipped and trucking companies can't find enough drivers. 

     On Wednesday, the Biden administration said the Port of Los Angeles -- one of the country's busiest -- would operate 24 hours a day in an attempt to clear the backlog. 

     IKEA, the world's largest furniture retailer, said Thursday shipping backlogs were making it difficult to get products from warehouses to stores. Still, the company reported higher revenues as customers moved to online sales. 

     Business inventories rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said separately Friday. The ratio of inventories to sales, which measures how much is in stock relative to sales, rose slightly but remains well below prepandemic levels. 

     James Burris, owner of Black Dog Bikes in Staunton, Va., regularly tells customers looking for a specific item that he can't get it shipped to the store right away because of supply-chain problems. 

     ""Not being able to suddenly order one of those higher-end bikes has hurt because we're missing out on the sale,"" he said. The store has a supply of entry-level bikes, he added, and sales overall have been on par with 2019. 

     September spending on autos and auto parts rose 0.5% last month even though auto unit sales fell in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.6 million from a recent peak of 18.8 million in April, according to a separate Commerce Department report. 

     Economists said the discrepancy was caused by higher prices and manufacturers' greater focus on luxury vehicles.The sector has been hit hard by a global shortage in computer chips, leaving dealers with few cars on their lots. 

     Spending at restaurants and bars was up 0.3% in September. Consumers also spent 1.8% more at gas stations, and 3.7% more at sporting goods, music and book stores. 

     A delayed back-to-school shopping season may have boosted September's number. Some parents held off on purchases in the summer while waiting for schools to clarify plans, said Ms. Markowska, the Jefferies economist. 

     Zach Gray, manager of Music & Arts, a music store in Greenville S.C., said many are buying instruments this year, rather than renting, suggesting consumers have money to spend. ""It's not quite normal for a parent to drop $700 on a saxophone for their sixth-grader who's unsure they want to continue with it,"" he said.

408,"German Inflation Rose by More Than Expected in October

 
   By Maria Martinez 
 

  German consumer prices rose strongly in October, beating forecasts, according to preliminary data released by the German statistics office Destatis on Thursday. 

  Consumer prices rose 4.5% on year measured by national standards, above the forecast of 4.4% of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. They rose 4.6% on year by European Union-harmonized standards, above the forecast of 4.5%. 

  The increase in the inflation rate is caused mainly by base effects due to lower prices in 2020, the statistics office said. In this context, the temporary value added tax reduction and the sharp decline in mineral-oil-product prices also had an upward effect on the overall inflation rate, Destatis said. 

  Additional factors were the introduction of carbon-dioxide pricing in January 2021 and pandemic-related effects, such as marked price increases during the stage of economic recovery, the statistics office said. 

  Consumer prices rose 0.5% on month by national standards, in line with the forecast of economists polled by the Journal. Prices increased also by 0.5% by EU-harmonized standards, above the 0.4% forecasts of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. 

  Final results will be released on Nov. 10.

409,"McDonald&apos;s Raises Menu Prices as U.S. Worker Wages Climb--Update

By Heather Haddon 

     McDonald's Corp. is raising menu prices to keep pace with rapidly growing costs, the company said, with wages alone up at least 10% so far this year at U.S. restaurants. 

     The Chicago-based burger giant is struggling to recruit enough workers to serve customers as quickly as possible and keep its stores open at full hours, even as the chain offers higher pay, executives said. 

     Average wage increases at McDonald's U.S. restaurants have continued from the company's second quarter, when executives reported they were up around 5% domestically during the period. Higher wages, including an average 15% increase this year at company-owned U.S. restaurants, is helping, but not as much as anticipated, executives said. 

     ""Certainly I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized,"" chief executive Chris Kempczinski told investors Wednesday. 

     The Big Mac maker is also paying more for paper, food and other supplies, executives said. McDonald's expects its commodity costs for the year to rise by 3.5% to 4%, up from the 2% they grew earlier in 2021, executives said. 

     Those higher costs are making their way to consumers, as McDonald's executives said they expect U.S. prices to be up about 6% this year compared to last year. 

     Companies across the globe are raising consumer prices in response to growing costs spanning distribution and freight to fuel and food. U.S. inflation in September remained at its highest rate in more than a decade, Labor Department data showed. 

     Many restaurants are raising menu prices to offset higher wages for cooks and servers and rising costs for meat, packaging, vegetable oil and other commodities. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Del Taco Restaurants Inc. and Chili's owner Brinker International Inc. are among the chains that told investors in recent weeks that they have increased prices to help cover costs. 

     McDonald's said Wednesday that global same-store sales in the quarter ended Sept. 30 increased 10.2% compared with the same period before the pandemic. U.S. same-store sales were up 14.6% compared with the equivalent 2019 period. 

     McDonald's said that bigger order sizes and higher prices increased its revenue in the U.S., as did its new crispy chicken sandwich and celebrity-endorsed meals. Diners are placing more to-go orders and buying for larger groups than prior to the pandemic, contributing to higher sales per customer, executives said. 

     ""We are still selling more sandwiches, we're still selling more fries,"" Mr. Kempczinski said. 

     McDonald's reported quarterly net income climbed 22% from the same quarter a year earlier, rising to $2.15 billion. Sales totaling $6.2 billion increased 14% from the previous year's period. Adjusting for one-time items, McDonald's said it earned $2.76 a share. 

     The company's sales and earnings topped analysts' expectations. McDonald's shares rose 2.2% to $241.57 in morning trading. 

     McDonald's slightly increased its projected sales across its restaurants for 2021. It also anticipates opening more restaurants globally, mainly in China and other international markets. In the U.S., supply-chain backlogs for kitchen equipment and permitting delays are postponing some new restaurant openings until next year, the company said. 

     McDonald's, the world's biggest burger chain, said that it had fewer Covid-19-related restaurant closures over the past quarter in major markets such as Canada, France and Germany, helping McDonald's sales in those countries. Still, vaccine health pass requirements in France and quarantine orders in Australia, for example, made operations more challenging, the company said. 

     In the U.S., roughly 3,000 McDonald's dining rooms remain closed in areas with high Covid-19 infection rates, or roughly 20% of locations. U.S. sales remain elevated at drive-throughs, online and through delivery, even after reopening a location's dining room, executives said. 

     McDonald's acquired a string of technology startups prior to the pandemic to develop systems such as voice-recognition ordering at drive-throughs. The company said Wednesday it was selling a technology lab it developed in the Bay Area to International Business Machines Corp. to better advance that work.

410,"Stanley Black &amp; Decker Posts 3Q Sales Growth on Greater Volume, Higher Prices

 

     By Matt Grossman 

 

  Stanley Black & Decker Inc. on Thursday logged higher sales and earnings in the third quarter, with the tool company's chief executive saying it has been raising prices in response to higher input costs. 

  The New Britain, Conn.-based company posted earnings of $2.56 a share, compare with $2.44 a share in the comparable period last year. Total net earnings were $414.2 million, an increase from $394.9 million a year earlier. 

  Stripping out one-time items, adjusted earnings were $2.77 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were forecasting adjusted earnings of $2.47 a share. 

  Revenue grew to $4.26 billion, from $3.85 billion in 2020's third quarter. Analysts had expected sales of $4.25 billion. 

  Greater volume accounted for 8% of the rise in sales, while price increases contributed 2%, Stanley said. 

  Tool and storage sales climbed 14%, while industrial sales were 1% higher year over year. Security sales grew 5%. 

  Chief Executive James M. Loree said the company was raising prices and targeting better productivity to face supply challenges and inflationary pressure. 

  ""We are prioritizing meeting demand in a universally difficult supply chain environment and are actively addressing the inflationary trends impacting the business with new targeted pricing actions and increased productivity measures,"" Mr. Loree said.

411,"Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Post Biggest Weekly Gains in Months

  MARKET SNAPSHOT 

  U.S. stocks finished their best week in months after strong earnings reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.572%, up from 1.519% on Thursday. The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.07% to 88.36. U.S. oil futures finished higher, with prices up an eighth straight week. Gold futures ended lower, but prices logged their strongest weekly gain since early September. 

  MARKET WRAPS 

  EQUITIES 

  U.S. stocks rose, notching their biggest weekly gains in months following a strong streak of earnings reports. 

  The S&P 500 added 0.75% after rallying in its biggest one-day advance since March on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.5%. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 1.8%, its best showing since July. Solid quarterly results from healthcare companies and banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have buoyed the market in recent days. Economic data have also helped reassure investors about the growth outlook. 

  Japanese stocks ended broadly higher, led by especially strong gains in electronics stocks, as the yen fell to its lowest level in nearly three years and amid continued hopes for economic reopening. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.8%, its highest level since November 2018. 

  Chinese stocks ended the session higher with coal and renewable-energy companies rising. Renewable-energy companies are facing tailwinds from continued policy support as China seeks to decarbonize. Coal producers, on the other hand, are likely benefiting from high coal prices as the country faces an energy crunch. The Shanghai Composite Index ended 0.4% higher, the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 0.1%, while the ChiNext Price Index rose 1.9% to 3276.32. 

  Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX-50 closed 0.3% lower, after company-specific trades prevented the index from coattailing on Wall Street's rise. Mainfreight declined 2.3% and lost 6.0% this week as shipping companies that have benefited from the pandemic gave back some of their strong gains. The index fell 0.6% for the week and is down 2.0% this month. 

  And Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.7% higher, overcoming a midsession wobble amid gains by travel and mining stocks. Qantas, Corporate Travel Management, Flight Centre and Webjet added between 2.0% and 4.05% after Australia's most-populous state said it would no longer quarantine fully vaccinated international arrivals from next month. The ASX 200 finished 0.6% higher for the week. 

  COMMODITIES 

  Oil futures extended their rise to multiyear highs, with U.S. and global benchmark crude scoring an eighth weekly gain in a row - the longest such streak of gains for a front-month Brent contract in more than two decades. 

  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose 1.2% to settle at $82.28 a barrel, with front-month prices marking their highest finish since Oct. 21, 2014, according to Dow Jones Market Data. December Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 1% to $84.86 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe after hitting a session high above $85. Prices ended the session at their highest since Oct. 9, 2018. 

  Gold futures ended lower, as strength in Treasury yields and the U.S. stock market help lead prices to their first loss in four sessions. But the precious metal still notched its best weekly advance in six weeks. 

  December gold fell nearly 1.7% to settle at $1,768.30 an ounce on Comex, after picking up 0.2% on Thursday and settling at the highest since Sept. 14, FactSet data show. For the week, gold gained 0.6%, which marked its steepest weekly climb since the week ended Sept. 3. 

   
 
 

  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES 

  Retail Sales Rise, Showing Strong Consumer Demand, Higher Inflation 

  Americans stepped up their spending in September, a sign of resilient demand and rising inflation as consumers head into the holiday shopping season. 

  Sales at retail stores, restaurants and online sellers rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. The rise in sales reflects persistently strong demand and higher consumer prices. 

  Consumers, armed with stimulus payments and rising wages, have stepped up spending this year, shrugging off the Delta variant of Covid-19, the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and emerging supply constraints. The retail sales, which aren't adjusted for inflation, rose 13.9% in September from a year earlier. Consumer inflation increased 5.4% in that time, according to the Labor Department. 

   
 
 

  U.S. Consumer Sentiment Decreased in Early October -University of Michigan 

  Consumer sentiment in the U.S. fell slightly in early October as the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant and supply-chain strains weighed on Americans' mood. 

  The preliminary estimate of the index of consumer sentiment released Friday by the University of Michigan decreased to 71.4 in October from 72.8 in September. The reading missed estimates from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the indicator to come in at 73.0. 

  ""The Delta variant, supply-chain shortages, and reduced labor-force-participation rates will continue to dim the pace of consumer spending into 2022,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. 

   
 
 

  J&J Covid-19 Booster Shot Endorsed by FDA Advisers 

  Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously Friday to recommend the agency authorize an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, to shore up protection against the coronavirus. 

  The panel of outside doctors and experts voted 19-0 to recommend that all adults who received a first dose of the J&J vaccine should get the second dose at least two months later. 

  The FDA could decide on whether to clear a J&J booster within days. 

   
 
 

  Goldman Sachs Profit Rises on Deal Bonanza 

  Companies are ravenous for deals. Wall Street investment bankers are feasting on big paydays. 

  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Friday reported a 60% jump in profit and a 26% increase in revenue, beating analysts' expectations. The Wall Street titan rounded out earnings season for the biggest U.S. banks, all of which reported double-digit profit gains. 

  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. released some of the money they had set aside to deal with pandemic losses, a sign of their confidence in the bumpy economic recovery. 

   
 
 

  Nissan Motor Ordered to Pay $353.9 Million to Middle East Company 

  Nissan Motor Co. was ordered by a Dubai court to pay 1.3 billion Emirati dirham ($353.9 million) to Middle East company Al Dahana FZCO, which sought damages over a distribution agreement. 

  Al Dahana said the Dubai Court of First Instance issued its judgment in September. In the case, which was first filed in 2019, Al Dahana said it was seeking compensation for damages suffered due to breach of contract by Nissan. 

  A Nissan spokesman said the company had fully complied with its contractual obligations and that it was appealing the decision.

412,"In Brainard, Powell Gets Key Policy Ally -- WSJ

  Two Fed veterans must navigate a runup of inflation that is lasting longer than expected 

By Nick Timiraos 

     President Biden's decision to nominate Lael Brainard to become Federal Reserve vice chairwoman elevates a veteran policy maker and economist who has been a strong ally of Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank's boldest policy decisions during the pandemic. 

     Ms. Brainard was a key adviser to Mr. Powell as the Fed scaled up emergency-lending backstops last year, and she provided influential intellectual support for his effort last year to revamp the Fed's policy-setting framework. Under the new framework, the Fed set aside its practice of raising rates to pre-empt inflationary pressures and pledged to keep interest rates low to foster a faster and broader labor-market recovery. 

     Ms. Brainard has been especially outspoken about avoiding the mistakes of raising interest rates prematurely after a downturn when interest rates are near zero. 

     Mr. Biden on Monday also said he would nominate Mr. Powell to a second term as Fed chairman. Now, both leaders face perhaps their trickiest policy challenge of the past four years: A bout of inflation that is proving to be more stubborn than anyone at the central bank anticipated is raising questions over how the Fed should set policy in the months ahead. 

     Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have underscored the importance of not raising rates until labor markets are tight to build up the credibility of their new framework this year. But with inflation running well above the Fed's 2% target, they are facing questions over how long they can maintain that stance before eroding the central bank's credibility. 

     Brisk demand for goods, disrupted supply chains, temporary shortages and a rebound in travel have pushed 12-month inflation to its highest readings in decades. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.1% in October from a year earlier, according to the Fed's preferred gauge. 

     ""We're entering a period of great policy uncertainty. Will they raise rates in the first half of 2022? Are they going to have the resolve to wait? It's going to take a lot of courage,"" said Derek Tang, an economist at LH Meyer Inc., an economic-forecasting firm. 

     ""Brainard has been very focused on maintaining maximum employment,"" said Mr. Tang. ""If there's a difference between how Powell and Brainard characterize that threshold, the market could ask, 'Who should we listen to?'"" 

     If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Brainard would succeed Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, whose term on the central bank's board expires in January. The Fed's vice chair, along with the New York Fed president, is part of the inner circle of advisers -- known as the troika -- that shape the agenda for monetary-policy deliberations by the Fed's rate-setting committee. 

     When the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global dash for dollars that overwhelmed the ability of many markets to function in March 2020, Mr. Powell asked Ms. Brainard to join the group, an arrangement that has continued to the present. 

     Before joining the Fed in 2014, Ms. Brainard helped manage President Barack Obama's response to the 2008 financial crisis during four years as the Treasury Department's top financial diplomat, making her one of the few Democrats intimately involved in responding to the last two economic shocks. 

     Ms. Brainard served as an adviser to President Bill Clinton on international economics in the late 1990s. She also served as a staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the George H.W. Bush administration. 

     Even though Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have been aligned on monetary policy, there are questions over how they will resolve differences on other issues. Since he became chairman in 2018, she has dissented on 23 board votes, often to protest against loosening banking rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. 

     Among the six sitting Fed governors, Ms. Brainard has spoken the most enthusiastically about the central bank adopting a digital dollar while raising warnings about the risks of unregulated private digital money, including so-called stablecoins that seek to tie the value of their respective offerings to the dollar. 

     Ms. Brainard also expressed concern over the dollar losing its dominance in international payments if other central banks, including in China, press ahead with their digital currencies. 

     Mr. Powell, on the other hand, told lawmakers this summer he was torn over whether the benefits of issuing a digital dollar outweighed the costs, including potentially disrupting the banking system. 

     Ms. Brainard has pulled the Fed her way on some key banking issues, including twice in 2019, both times with crucial backing from Mr. Powell. First, the Fed bucked opposition from big banks when it voted to establish a round-the-clock payment system for banks to exchange money, a proposal she spearheaded. 

     Later, the Fed opted against joining two other federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., on a proposal to overhaul rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law designed to end racial lending disparities. After Mr. Biden's election, the OCC scrapped its proposed overhaul. 

     Ms. Brainard ""almost single-handedly saved the Community Reinvestment Act and managed to get four Republican governors to vote for her outline, "" said Jesse Van Tol, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. 

     Financial-industry officials welcomed both of Mr. Biden's Fed nominations. ""We expect regulators will continue to hold the largest banks to the high regulatory and supervisory standards that have remained in place to support a resilient and essential part of the U.S. financial system,"" said Kevin Fromer, chief executive officer of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest U.S. banks. 

     Ms. Brainard received 61 votes during her confirmation in 2014, including from four Republicans who are still in the Senate. 

     The daughter of an American diplomat, Ms. Brainard grew up on both sides of the Iron Curtain in Germany and Poland during the Cold War. She has credited that upbringing with fostering her interest in economics. ""I was fascinated by how two countries so close in geography and resources could diverge so sharply simply by being separated by the Iron Curtain,"" she said in a 2014 speech in Claremont, Calif. 

     Life in Poland was grim, with an economy that suffocated under a heavy state apparatus, she recalled in a 2017 interview with the college newspaper at Wesleyan University, where she completed her undergraduate degree. The most successful parts of the economy were farming and small-business enterprises that had ""the least amount of red tape and the greatest role for individual initiative,"" she said. 

     Ms. Brainard received her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University after a stint working for consulting firm McKinsey & Co. She is married to Kurt Campbell, who is Mr. Biden's point person on Asian affairs on the White House National Security Council.

413,"U.S. Retail Sales Rose 1.7% in October -- Update

By Gabriel T. Rubin 

     American consumers spent more at the start of the holiday shopping season, brushing off concerns about higher prices at retailers last month. 

     Sales at U.S. retail stores, online sellers, and restaurants rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.7% in October compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Consumers continued their stepped-up spending despite continued Covid-19 fears and inflation concerns. 

     Spending rose sharply, by 4%, at online retailers, along with big gains at electronics, appliance and hardware stores. Grocery-store sales rose by 1.1% while restaurant and bar sales were flat. Other gains occurred at gas stations, where sales rose 3.9%, and auto dealerships, with a 1.8% gain. 

     Walmart Inc. on Tuesday reported higher sales in the third quarter, saying it increased prices as more consumers shopped early for the holidays. The retailer said U.S. inventory rose as it prepare for ""an expected strong holiday season."" Home Depot Inc., among several retailers reporting earnings this week, said its third-quarter results were better than expected. 

     The elevated spending levels suggest solid holiday sales this month and next. Consumers have said they are worried about inflation, which hit a three-decade high last month, but planned to continue spending. 

     ""Consumers say they're pessimistic -- we have had very high inflation -- but the truth is they're in very good shape right now,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. As reasons for the robust demand for goods he cited the roughly $2 trillion in excess savings that households have accrued since the start of the pandemic, as well as low interest rates and an improving labor market. 

     Core retail sales, a measurement that excludes spending on autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, were up 1.6%, showing that consumers increased discretionary spending in addition to taking on higher prices for necessary goods. Spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores was up 1.5% and rose by 2.2% at department stores. Pharmacies and clothing stores both saw modest declines from the previous month. 

     The combination of strong demand, snarled supply chains, higher prices and an unbalanced labor market is making for an unusual holiday season where record sales may be accompanied by shortages and long waits for goods. Inflation may also start to cut into demand for consumers with lower incomes who may put off purchases due to price increases, economists say. 

     Norm Bruce, who with his wife, Eve, owns Martha Merrell's Books and Toys in Waukesha, Wis., said that he expected strong holiday sales. A winter farmers market they set up in front of their Main Street store was a success the first weekend of November, and they plan to continue to use the weekly event to help attract customers. But supply-chain issues and rising prices are taking their toll. 

     ""We're telling our customers right now, if you see it, buy it. We don't have 10 or 20 copies of a book right now, we have maybe 1 or 2,"" Mr. Bruce said. 

     Most books have prices printed directly on the jacket, preventing Mr. Bruce from charging more. But to keep up with supply pressures, the store has had to raise prices on some other items, giving some customers sticker shock. 

     ""All of a sudden, I was having to put increases of $4 or $5 on stuffed animals, because the shipping cost has gone up tremendously,"" Mr. Bruce said. ""Consumers right now are very forgiving, but when the prices start going up, they say, that's a stuffed dog, I don't want to pay that much."" 

     Retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation, so some of the increase can be attributed to higher prices. 

     The backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing, as container ships struggle to unload their cargo at U.S. ports. Containers can wait weeks before they are picked up by trucking companies, which say they can't find enough drivers to meet demand. 

     The resulting inflation, if left unchecked, could start eating into consumers' budgets enough to tamp down on the elevated demand for goods, Mr. Faucher said. But there are strong incentives for retailers to get their supply chains sorted out. 

     ""If you can find out how to get your product to consumers when they're having trouble finding things, you're going to make a lot of money,"" he said. 

     Companies attempting to get ahead of the holiday crush may have simply moved it forward by a few weeks, according to a study by Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. 

     Imports are up 20.5% compared with 2019. And individual companies are experiencing longer shipping times for goods, which then prompts them to order goods even earlier ahead of peak shopping times. 

     Online shopping has dominated the early days of the holiday retail rush, but that is expected to shift to in-store shopping as the holidays get closer and customers try to avoid shipping delays. And some gift-givers may choose to opt out of material gifts altogether. 

     ""Gift card and digital e-gift card sales have also been trending up recently which could continue to be a theme through the holidays,"" said Felipe Chacon, an economist at payments company Square. 

     Labor shortages are also contributing to price increases as businesses struggle to meet customer demand. 

     Maureen Craig, who owns the Southern Cajun-Creole restaurant Alligator Soul in Savannah, Ga., said that the main thing preventing her from having her best year ever is inability to find enough staff. 

     Restaurant and bar sales remained flat between September and October, a sign of weakness in the recovery for an industry that has struggled with a wave of quitting employees, high food prices and persistently high Covid-19 case levels. Restaurants, especially in northern states, are bracing for another winter dependent in part on outdoor dining as some customers remain reluctant to dine indoors. 

     ""It's been very, very difficult to hire -- more in the kitchen than in the front of the house,"" Ms. Craig said. She recently decided to close the restaurant on Sundays to alleviate some of the pressure on her chef and kitchen staff. Customers have taken it in stride when she calls them to tell them she has to switch their reservations.

414,"Estee Lauder and 6 More Companies With Upbeat Dividend News This Week -- Barrons.com

By Lawrence C. Strauss 

     More than a dozen S&P 500 companies declared dividend increases this week as earnings season, typically a busy time for such announcements, rolls ahead. Estee Lauder Companies, Becton, Dickinson, and Simon Property Group were on the list. 

     Estee Lauder (ticker: EL), whose portfolio includes fragrances and skin-care products, said it would boost its quarterly payout to 60 cents a share, up 13% from 53 cents. The stock, which was recently yielding 0.7%, has returned about 28% this year through the close on Thursday, dividends included. That is a little ahead of the S&P 500's 26% return. 

     Medical technology company Becton, Dickinson (BDX) declared a quarterly dividend of 87 cents a share. That is an increase of about 5%, or 4 cents a share. 

     The stock, which has returned about minus 1% this year, yields 1.4%. This marks the 50(th) straight year in which the company has raised its dividend. It is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, whose members have paid out a higher dividend for at least 25 straight years. 

     Simon Property Group (SPG), a real estate investment trust focused on shopping malls and outlets, is planning to raise its dividend for the third time this year. Its board this week declared a quarterly disbursement of $1.65 a share, an increase of 10% from $1.50. 

     In June, the company said it would boost its quarterly dividend to $1.40 a share from $1.30. In August, management declared a quarterly dividend of $1.50. 

     The stock, which yields 3.9%, has returned about 100% this year, reflecting increasingly positive investor sentiment toward shopping malls and the economy's reopening following the pandemic. 

     Emerson Electric (EMR) said it plans to raise its dividend by a penny, or 2%, to 51.5 cents a share. The stock, which has returned about 23% this year, yields 2.1%. The company is also a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. 

     Devon Energy (DVN) declared a quarterly dividend of 84 cents a share, up sharply from 49 cents a share previously. The increase reflects higher oil prices and improved conditions in the energy business. 

     The company's board also authorized a $1 billion share- repurchase program through the end of 2022 -- a total equal to about 4% of the company's market capitalization. Devon Energy has a fixed dividend with variable additional payouts that hinge on business conditions. 

     In the previous quarter, the fixed dividend was 11 cents a share, while the variable one was 38 cents, for a total of 49 cents. The stock, which has returned about 180% this year, yields 2.9%. 

     Pharmaceutical drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 2 cents a share, to 46 cents, an increase of 4.5%. 

     The stock, which yields 1.4%, has returned about 31% year to date. 

     In other news, apparel company PVH (PVH) said that its board's executive committee on Oct. 29 declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 3.75 cents a share on the common stock. 

     The dividend was suspended last year due to the pandemic. The stock has returned about 27% this year. 

     The company's brands include Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.

415,"Have Consumers&apos; Inflation Fears Sped Spending? It Seems So -- Barron&apos;s

By Lisa Beilfuss 

     Inflation is making consumers miserable. To judge from retail sales, that might not matter -- for now. But lofty inflation expectations are a warning worth heeding, potentially signaling slower economic growth ahead. 

     When the Commerce Department reported October sales across retail and food-services stores, the results far exceeded expectations, with total sales rising at the fastest pace since March. On the heels of a surprisingly sluggish third-quarter gross-domestic-product report that showed the slowest pace of growth since the recovery began, solid retail sales reminded investors that U.S. consumers are flush, shopping, and still powering economic activity. 

     You wouldn't know it, though, to look at confidence surveys. Take the latest report from the University of Michigan. Consumer sentiment fell in early November to its lowest level in a decade, says Richard Curtin, the survey's director. 

     The details are even drearier: A quarter of U.S. households expect their financial situation to deteriorate, the biggest share since 2008; half of respondents say the national economy has recently weakened and will continue to do so in the year ahead; and nearly six in 10 consumers think bad times financially will persist in the next five years. Economists at Goldman Sachs say the recent declines in the Michigan gauge would imply a 0.4% drag on fourth-quarter annualized consumption growth, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP. 

     What consumers say and what they do don't always jibe. Some economists shun sentiment surveys, viewing them as useless when spending data are readily available each month. After all, the golden rule of behavioral economics is to observe what people pay, not what they say, economist Dan Geller notes. 

     But it isn't that simple. Since retail sales are reported in nominal terms, meaning the data aren't inflation-adjusted, it is worth considering the corresponding increase in the consumer price index. That's a back-of-the-envelope way to inflation-adjust the sales figure, says Citi economist Veronica Clark. Applying the CPI roughly suggests that higher prices represented about half of the October increase in sales, with actual sales volume representing the balance. 

     Higher prices aren't altogether bad. Companies are successfully passing on climbing wages, rising material prices, and surging shipping costs, protecting profit margins and then padding them some more. Anxious about supply-chain challenges, retailers began pushing out a wave of holiday deals in October, a report from software company Adobe shows. But those deals have been skimpy. Prices rose in 12 of 18 categories last month; they almost always fell, on average, during the same period from 2015 to 2019. 

     Expectations for record-high corporate profit margins of 13.1% this year, 13.2% next year, and 13.8% in 2023 are proof that cost pressures aren't squeezing margins, says Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Retailers' stocks are benefiting. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (ticker: XRT) is up 10% this month and 61% this year, far outpacing respective gains of 2% and 25% in the S&P 500 index. Consumers might not be happy about it, but they are paying up. 

     At least for now. ""I wouldn't look at it and say, 'All our concerns are gone,' "" notes Citi's Clark of the upside retail sales report. ""Part of it is that prices are pulling forward holiday shopping,"" she adds. 

     While solid October sales augur well for fourth-quarter GDP, Clark cautions of possible payback in November and December, with sales in those months potentially lower because consumers shopped earlier. 

     Therein lies one reason not to discard survey data that are so glaringly conflicting with reality, or at least the reality before it is adjusted for inflation. Curtin at the University of Michigan attributes falling confidence almost entirely to rising prices. While respondents widely reported nominal income gains, half of all families foresee reduced real incomes next year, and a quarter say they already feel inflation is reducing their standard of living, he says. 

     Consumers speeding up purchases in anticipation of higher prices is the very dynamic central bankers fear. If real-world prices shape inflation expectations that wind up determining actual inflation, perception becomes reality. In fact, the report's measure of inflation expectations over the next year edged up to 4.9%, the highest since 2008, with 71% of all consumers surveyed predicting higher prices in the year ahead. 

     It's important to note that long-term inflation expectations within the latest Michigan survey held at 2.9% -- elevated, but not alarmingly so. One reading: Consumers buy the narrative that inflation is mostly transitory, believing that rates of prices increase will slow after next year. But not everyone is sold. 

     Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, notes that the share of people expecting inflation to be around the Federal Reserve's 2% target over the next year has fallen sharply, and is near the lowest level observed over the past few decades. The number of people predicting inflation of 3% or higher has shot up dramatically, driven by the share of people anticipating inflation of 15% or more. 

     Few things are seeing prices rise at that pace. ""But the simple fact that people perceive it that way should be enough to scare the Fed,"" Porcelli says, adding that inflation fear is widespread, with the entire income distribution on the same page. 

     The question isn't whether consumers feel inflation and expect it to run higher over the next year. It's whether consumers are spending now because of those rising inflation expectations at the expense of future spending -- or in spite of them.

416,"The 10-Point: The Wall Street Journal&apos;s Guide to the Day&apos;s Top News

By Matt Murray 

  Good Morning. In today's edition, small-cap stocks get a boost, inflation means bigger profits for some U.S. businesses, a path to international carbon trading, and Covid-19 cases rise in the North and West. 

  Small-cap stocks are getting a boost as investors seek refuge from inflation 

  The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks has advanced 5% in November, outpacing the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark's 1.7% gain. Investors are focusing on small companies that they hope can respond quickly to rising inflation. Confidence in the Russell 2000 also tends to reflect positive expectations for the economy, in part because economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials and industrials make up more of the small-cap stock index than of the S&P 500. Investors seeking refuge from inflation have also driven the price of gold up 4.8% this month and sent materials stocks up 5.8% -- putting the group at the lead of the S&P 500's 11 sectors for November. Demand for 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, meanwhile, has dragged yields to record lows. The prospect of negative returns on super safe inflation-protected bonds has pushed investors to buy riskier assets. 

  -- In global trading today, Asian stock markets closed mostly higher, Europe was mixed at midday and U.S. stock futures were up. 

  -- Mall stocks are back in fashion as shoppers return. 

  -- In 2018, uBiome was raising its third round of venture-capital funding, which eventually amounted to $59 million. Just one year later, the company had collapsed. 

 

  Some companies are raising prices enough to outrun inflation and produce some of their fattest profit margins. After decades of grinding down costs and prices, industries including retail, manufacturing and biotech have seen their profits rise. Other industries, largely those still climbing out of pandemic lockdowns, such as travel, or those too weighted with inflationary costs, have raised prices but haven't experienced a profit boost. 

  -- The cost to ship a container across the Pacific fell by more than 25% last week, signaling easing demand for Asian exports. 

  -- The Biden administration is stressing its efforts to fight rising costs as high inflation puts its political fortunes at risk. 

  -- A decision on who will be next to head the Federal Reserve is expected as soon as this week. 

 

  Workers ages 25 to 54 are returning at a slower rate, damping expectations for a bigger workforce this fall 

  Roughly 1.4 million fewer so-called prime-age workers are working or looking for a job than in the month before the pandemic hit. Factors that were expected to push up job participation this fall, like school reopenings and the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits, aren't as important as previously thought or are taking a long time to boost labor supply. Dwindling savings could drive some workers back; others might settle into a new lifestyle and never return. A slow labor-force recovery could keep propelling wages higher as employers compete for a shrunken pool of workers. Such wage growth could prolong inflationary pressures and force the Fed to raise rates sooner than it otherwise would. 

  -- Turnover isn't evenly spread across the U.S. workforce, according to new data on people who have quit. 

  -- The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is electing a new president this week. 

  -- M.B.A. starting salaries are hitting record highs in a tight labor market. 

  -- Malaysia is testing whether its economy can run with fewer foreign workers. 

 

  Manufacturers struggling with a shortage of chips are finding workarounds -- redesigning products, shipping uncompleted units and focusing on older, lower-tech models. Reworking products has been cumbersome for some companies and challenging for consumers who received products with missing features. Some companies ended up with better products. T3 Motion, which makes electric stand-up vehicles for airport and university security officers, redesigned its vehicle to use a single processor-part of changes that are expected to increase vehicle range. 

  In other business news... 

  -- Airbus said it can't ramp up production of its A320 single-aisle jet fast enough to meet demand and forecasts delivery constraints for a further three years. 

  -- National child-care operators such as KinderCare Education and Bright Horizons Family Solutions are buying up closed centers, aiming to fill a void left by the pandemic. 

 

  The COP26 summit ended with agreement on long-stalled rules on international carbon trading. Governments from nearly every country endorsed a set of preliminary rules over how governments and companies can create, value and swap credits to drive their net emissions lower in a global trading system. Negotiations over the carbon agreement were overshadowed by a higher-profile deal on emissions cuts and climate-change funding. That broader deal asks its 190-plus signatories next year to revisit emissions-cutting plans that fell short of what scientists say is enough to prevent the worst possible effects of climate change. The deal, though, left big questions about how governments will follow through. 

  -- Royal Dutch Shell plans to consolidate its dual-share structure and move its headquarters to London to help it navigate the transition to low-carbon energy. 

 

  Covid-19 cases are climbing in the upper Midwest, Southwest and parts of the Northeast. Health authorities say the Delta variant is easily finding pockets of unvaccinated people, even in some of the most-vaccinated places, like Vermont, where about 72% of the population is fully inoculated. Meanwhile, some states, like Michigan, report that fully vaccinated people are increasingly adding to their Covid-19 numbers -- reflecting both the rising number of vaccinated people and the vaccines' waning effectiveness among people who got the shots early on. The stalled progress is an unwelcome turn as more people are expected to travel and congregate indoors during the Thanksgiving holiday. 

  Quote of the Day: 

  ""After nearly two years, I don't blame anyone for feeling done with the Covid-19 pandemic. The unfortunate truth, however, is the pandemic isn't done with us."" 

  -- Don Herrington, interim director of the Arizona Dept. of Health Services 

  -- Many governments are treading cautiously in rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations to children. 

  -- More schools are opting to use test-to-stay screening protocols over quarantines to keep children in classrooms after they have been exposed to Covid-19. 

  -- International-student enrollment in U.S. colleges and universities is showing signs of a rebound this fall after a pandemic-induced decline. 

 

  President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will meet virtually today, putting Mr. Biden's China policy to the test as the two attempt to build on signs of easing hostility. Both sides set modest expectations and don't anticipate concrete outcomes. Broadly, Mr. Biden and his team have settled on a strategy of managing the relationship through what they call ""intense diplomacy."" 

  -- As the U.S. seeks to counter China's global influence, The Journal looks at how Mr. Biden's infrastructure plan aims to compete with China's Belt and Road initiative. 

  In other world news... 

  -- China's social mobility has stalled, and inequality has worsened. 

  -- A Chinese state-controlled company bought an Italian military-drone manufacturer and transferred its know-how and technology without authorities' knowledge. 

  -- Poland, locked in an escalating culture war within the EU for several years, now finds itself on the front lines of Europe's external conflict with migrants and Russia. 

  -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, son of slain Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, launched a presidential bid to retake control of the country.

417,"Foreign Investment---European Trader: Demand for Appliances Helps This Steel Maker -- Barron&apos;s

By Rupert Steiner 

     The performance of stainless steel manufacturer Acerinox is closely linked to the expansion of global economies, which means the stock was hit hard by slumping demand during the height of the pandemic. 

     The Madrid-based company, which makes and distributes hot- and cold-rolled stainless steel used in the aerospace and automotive industries and in household goods such as washing machines, was operating at just 65% capacity in the second quarter of 2020. Its shares (ticker: ACX.Spain) fell 32% from December 2019 to October 2020. 

     The stock has bounced back this year, gaining 14%, to a recent 10.30 euros (about $11.64). Last month, Acerinox, which markets its products in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, flagged a jump in demand for alloys and stainless steel. Acerinox says it's on course for its strongest annual results in its 51-year history, despite rising energy prices. 

     The pickup in demand, which analysts predict will be sustained well into 2022, isn't the only catalyst for growth. The company's $587 million acquisition of German-based alloy maker VDM Metals two years ago is performing ahead of expectations, which Bastian Synagowitz, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, predicts will lead to a continuation of buybacks or extra dividends. He has a price target of EUR17 on Acerinox. 

     Although Acerinox hasn't announced plans for its loss-making Malaysian unit, there has been speculation about a divestiture. A sale would boost the stock to EUR20, predicts Franco German broker Oddo BHF. Acerinox declined to comment. 

     Iñigo Recio Pascual, an analyst at Spain's GVC Gaesco, tells Barron's that ""order books suggest that, at least in the first part of [2022], the stainless steel market will remain strong. Inventories still remain at reasonable levels."" He adds that another growth driver is price negotiations with customers, particularly in the auto sector, for annual contracts, ""with good prospects for 2022, especially in Europe, as during 2021 price increases have not been passed on to them."" 

     Acerinox has a market value of EUR2.7 billion, with production sites in the U.S., Germany, Spain, Malaysia, and South Africa. It fetches a low 5.1 times this year's expected earnings, in line with its peers. 

     In 2020, Acerinox posted revenue of EUR4.6 billion, down from EUR4.7 billion in the prior year. Nonetheless, profit was EUR49 million, versus a EUR60 million loss in 2019. The company credited this to cost-cutting. In this year's first nine months, net profit rose to EUR373 million from EUR31 million in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue climbed 38%, to EUR4.77 billion. 

     Steel demand depends on overall GDP growth, with autos and household appliances key. In 2020, companies held steel inventories to a minimum. ""Demand has come back with strength,"" says analyst Pascual. Despite a fourth wave of Covid-19, major economies such as Germany and the U.S. are resisting a return to growth-sapping restrictions. 

     Recent developments in China also might help Acerinox. In April, under pressure to create a more level playing field, Beijing agreed to remove a 13% value-added-tax rebate for steel exports, which will increase costs for Chinese producers. Acerinox doesn't sell directly in China, but that nation accounts for 50% of global steel consumption and production, so its influence on demand and production is important for overall prices, analysts say. 

     In a quarterly update in November, Acerinox's chief executive officer, Bernardo Velazquez Herreros, said: ""We estimate that Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization] will improve slightly from the third to the fourth quarter, due to strong demand and low inventory levels. If these forecasts prove correct, we will achieve our best results ever.""

418,"EMEA Morning Briefing: Stocks to Extend Gain After Wall Street Ends Losing Streak

  MARKET WRAPS 

  Watch For: 

  UK quarterly national accounts; UK Balance of Payments. 

  Opening Call: 

  European stocks could open higher, U.S. stock futures edge lower. Dollar is slightly higher in Asia, 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edges higher. Oil gains, gold steady. 

  Equities: 

  European stocks are set to extend gains and follow Wall Street higher Wednesday after President Joe Biden reassured investors by calling for vaccinations and testing but no travel curbs in response to the omicron coronavirus variant. 

  Biden announced the government will provide 500 million free rapid-test kits and increase vaccination efforts but gave no indication of plans for travel bans or other restrictions that might disrupt the economy. Other governments in Asia and Europe have tightened travel controls or pushed back plans to relax curbs already in place. 

  Biden ""provided some much-needed reassurances for markets,"" Yeap Jun Rong of IG said in a report. 

  Stocks in Asia were cautiously higher and U.S. stock futures edged lower. 

  ""With pre-holiday liquidity tumbling, and market direction entirely dominated by headline derived volatility, it is probably not wise to get too wedded to ""the worst is over just yet. I'll say is again, volatility is the winner in December, not thematic direction,"" said Jeffrey Halley at OANDA. 

  Meanwhile, December's decline in consumer confidence adds to the list of deteriorating consumer indicators, Capital Economics's senior Europe economist Jack Allen-Reynolds said. The European Commission's measure of consumer confidence fell from minus 6.8 in November to minus 8.3 in December. 

  Apart from this weakening, other indicators such as mobility trackers also point to a recent drop in spending, Allen-Reynolds said. 

  The economist said the data is consistent with Capital Economics's view that GDP growth will slow sharply in the fourth quarter but avoid a contraction. Looking ahead, the pandemic situation presents a big downside risk to 1Q, with the economy set to start next year on the back foot. 

  The combination of a high speed of propagation of the Omicron coronavirus variant and a still significant number of people without any protection may mean that additional restrictions will be needed in the weeks ahead as a ""circuit breaker"" to preserve healthcare capacity, Gilles Moec, Group Chief Economist at AXA Investment Managers said. 

  This would dent global GDP growth this winter, even if it would likely be a mere pause in the recovery trajectory, he said. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a downside risk to AXA IM's forecasts for 2022, Moec said. However, ""we aren't back to square one in the fight against the pandemic,"" he added. 

  Stocks to watch: Miner Rio Tinto's purchase of the Rincon lithium project in Argentina demonstrates its confidence in the battery material's outlook and reflects an earlier commitment to invest in commodities such as lithium needed for a low-carbon economy, said Macquarie. 

  Rincon has the potential to produce 50,000 tons a year of lithium carbonate for 40 years, lifting Rio's long-term lithium-carbonate production outlook to 108,000 tons a year, Macquarie said. Rio was down 1.6% in Sydney. 

  Forex: 

  The US dollar was slightly stronger in early Asia trading. ""For the most part, the dollar has been king,"" this year, Scott Petruska, chief currency strategist at Silicon Valley Bank, told WSJ. 

  But over the past five weeks or so the rally has flagged due to a combination of factors including Treasurys stalling and big central banks becoming more hawkish. 

  ""The dollar's safe-haven role is still front and center,"" Petruska said. The market is still very long the dollar, he said, and thinks the dollar index could still increase by one percent. Then in 2Q or 3Q, ""hopefully we'll have a global recovery and then the dollar will turn lower."" 

  Asian currencies consolidate against USD amid mixed developments. Overnight gains on Wall Street have boosted risk sentiment in Asia today; however, the relatively quiet economic calendar may put focus on the ongoing risks of the Covid-19 Omicron variant to the region's reopening plans, IG said. 

  Bonds: 

  The 10-year yield rose to 1.469% from Tuesday's 1.461%. Federal Reserve Bank of New York research said central-bank bond buying done in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, did a good job of restoring market functioning in the face of heavy stress. 

  ""While it is difficult to pin down the effects of the Fed's purchases amidst the pandemic and numerous policy actions, the evidence suggests they were effective,"" said the bank. 

  The paper did add that the purchases were not a panacea, and the fact that the Fed rode to the market's rescue may increase moral hazard risks and make market participants believe the central bank will bail them out next time there's trouble. 

  Energy: 

  Oil rose in the morning Asian session on hopes that holiday travel-related demand will be stable. There appears to be optimism that holiday travel will remain intact for most vaccinated individuals, Oanda said. 

  Both the U.S. and the U.K. don't appear to be heading for pandemic-related lockdowns, suggesting oil's short-term outlook may not be completely derailed by the Omicron variant, Oanda added. 

  Metals: 

  Gold was trading steadily in the morning Asian session, and could consolidate during the rest of the holiday-shortened week. 

  Gold prices are figuring out their year-end trading range somewhere around $1,800/oz and that should remain intact as trading volumes decrease, Oanda said. Major markets such as Wall Street and including those for precious metals, will be closed on Friday in observance of the Christmas holiday. 

  Copper shifted lower in early Asian trading, with traders taking more short positions amid a bearish macro outlook, brokerage Marex said. 

  The bearishness is ""reflected in positioning where we see shorts across all three exchanges,"" it said, referring to the LME, Comex, Shanghai Futures Exchange. 

  However, logistics issues at Las Bambas copper mine, which produces 2% of the world's copper supply, could limit losses, Marex said. Protesters in Peru have been blocking a road used by the MMG-owned mine. 

  Lithium-rich spodumene is likely to remain in short supply, as increased production from mining operations is outpaced by demand from the electric-vehicle market, said Macquarie. 

  ""Lithium production rates have increased over 2021, with solid increases from spodumene producers in Western Australia and rising production from South America"" but ""the increase has failed to suppress spot lithium prices,"" said Macquarie. 

  The bank--which raises its spodumene price forecasts, including for 2022 by 71%, to $2,363/ton--said the market has swung to a deficit in 2021 from a surplus last year, and that the shortfall should deepen over this decade.

     U.S. inflation reached a nearly four-decade high in November, as strong consumer demand collided with pandemic-related supply constraints. 

     The Labor Department said the consumer-price index -- which measures what consumers pay for goods and services -- rose 6.8% in November from the same month a year ago. That was the fastest pace since 1982 and the sixth straight month in which inflation topped 5%. 

     The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 4.9% in November from a year earlier. That was a sharper increase than October's 4.6% rise, and the highest rate since 1991. 

     The increase in prices for new vehicles, which came in at 11.1% in November, was the largest on record, as were those for men's apparel and living room, kitchen and dining room furniture. A 7.9% surge in fast-food restaurant prices last month marked the sharpest on record too. 

     The steady rise in restaurant prices during the past few months is a sign of pass-through from wages into higher prices, economists say. That dynamic is increasingly showing up in other industries. Wages tracked by the Atlanta Fed climbed 4.3% in November, up from 4.1% in October and the highest since 2007. 

     Some energy prices showed signs of easing -- in part because of fear in the financial markets that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 could slow growth. But gasoline rose at a 6.1% monthly rate for the second straight month. 

     The November prices trend came before the emergence of the Omicron variant, which poses a new threat from a pandemic that is well into its second year. But the sharp price increases are the result of a booming economy that has developed imbalances in supply and demand as the U.S. continues to recover from the pandemic. 

     ""We have tremendous spending by consumers. A lot of people are getting hired. Demand is huge,"" Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics, Inc. said. He added that higher-than-expected inflation implies a needed pullback in fiscal and monetary stimulus. ""Even after doing that, the economy should still be in super shape producing growth rates and earnings not seen in decades."" 

     On a monthly basis, the CPI increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in November from the prior month, about the same as October's 0.9% increase. 

     The latest strong inflation report strengthens the case for Federal Reserve officials to commit to hastening the wind-down of their stimulus efforts, paving the way to raise interest rates in the spring to curb inflation. 

     ""I think the Fed already got ahead of today's data by pre-announcing that they will accelerate the taper next week,"" said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC. 

     Stocks and oil prices gained and government bond yields fell after the inflation figures reinforced expectations that the economy should slow gradually next year as the Fed tightens monetary policy. 

     Unlike in past recoveries, strong demand for goods such as autos, furniture and appliances has driven much of the inflation surge. Prices for services -- such as for travel and recreation -- have generally climbed much less with softer demand. The holiday season is likely exacerbating these dynamics, Ms. Markowska said, adding the supply and demand imbalance will continue to widen. 

     A shortage of available workers is also affecting inflation and the overall economy, pushing companies to raise prices to offset higher labor costs. Companies are setting aside an average 3.9% of total payroll for wage increases next year, the most since 2008, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a private research group. 

     Tip Hongchindaget said that while demand at her Charlotte, N.C., restaurant is booming, higher costs and scarce labor are squeezing her business. A surge in chicken prices has wiped out what used to be a reliable source of profit for her restaurant, Rice & Spice Thai Street Food. And though sales are strong, the dearth of workers has prompted her to start closing for Sunday lunch. 

     ""It has happened like a storm, and it just keeps coming,"" she said. ""I don't think we can keep giving more people higher wages."" 

     Ms. Tip said she is now researching technological upgrades that might require less labor. She is reluctant to increase prices after having done so earlier this year, especially since the area's other Asian restaurants haven't raised prices much. ""If we raise the price again this time, I'm pretty sure it's going to impact"" sales, she said. 

     On Thursday Costco Wholesale Corp. said its prices likely grew between 4.5% to 5% during the most recent quarter, a bit higher than the company predicted the previous quarter. ""I think it's going to continue,"" said Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti on a call to discuss earnings. ""Hopefully, we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding, but we'll see."" 

     Hormel Foods Corp., maker of Spam and Skippy peanut butter, said on Thursday that it raised prices on many of its different pantry staples, citing sharply higher costs. The Minnesota-based company said it raised the price of its Jennie-O turkey, for example, to counter higher feed costs and labor shortages. ""In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels,"" said chief financial officer James Sheehan on a call with analysts. 

     Sixty percent of small-business owners said they had increased prices in the previous 90 days, according to a November survey of more than 560 small businesses for The Wall Street Journal by Vistage Worldwide Inc., a business-coaching and peer-advisory firm. Eighty percent of the companies surveyed reported increased labor costs, while 72% said their suppliers had raised prices. 

     Companies are still struggling to get materials, though supply constraints were showing signs of easing before the Omicron variant emerged. The most prominent example of strained supply chains is a shortage of semiconductors that has hamstrung auto production. 

     Economists generally see inflationary pressure from supply constraints easing in 2022 as sidelined workers return, consumer demand for goods cools and production ramps up. However, they also expect those to be replaced by more persistent sources of price pressure such as rent and medical care. 

     Aichi Amemiya, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities, said a continuing shift in consumer spending from goods to services should also help calm inflation. Signs of improving transportation costs and auto production hint that inflationary pressure could begin easing early next year, though it is likely to remain high in December, Mr. Amemiya said. 

     Covid-19 continues to be a wild-card factor. Past virus surges have put downward pressure on prices for travel, recreation and other services that involve in-person interaction. However, a resurgence of cases ultimately could push inflation higher by increasing consumer demand for goods and triggering shutdowns of factories and ports, Mr. Amemiya said. 

     Persistently elevated inflation is hitting consumer budgets. 

     Dallas resident Greg Chu noticed a rise in his gasoline costs earlier this year -- an increase so sharp that he said he took his car to a mechanic. But there was nothing wrong with his car: The problem was much higher gas prices. The 27-year-old has taken to meticulously planning his day to reduce driving. Since food prices began rising last spring, he also is dining out less and is buying less meat and dairy at the grocery store. 

     ""Inflation has changed how I drive, shop and eat,"" said Mr. Chu, who works as an accountant. ""I can afford to pay these price increases, but at the cost of reducing my other expenses or savings, which I am not willing to do.""

420,"Dole Looks for Deals and Operational Efficiency After NYSE Listing

By Nina Trentmann 

     Dole, the fruit and vegetable company best known for its banana brand, is scouting the market for potential acquisition targets and working to streamline its operations after combining with Total Produce PLC and listing on the New York Stock Exchange. 

     In 2018, the company that previously operated as Dole Food Co. agreed to sell itself to Total Produce, which initially acquired a 45% stake. In July, Total Produce bought the rest of the business and the combined company began trading on the public markets as Dole PLC. 

     The initial public offering provided Dole with just under $400 million in new equity, which the company used to pay down costly debt and strengthen its balance sheet. The company also arranged $1.44 billion in new financing, including a term loan and a revolving credit facility. 

     ""Dole was heavily indebted and had a lot of expensive debt,"" said Chief Financial Officer Frank Davis, who previously served as finance chief of Total Produce. 

     The combined business had pro-forma revenue of $9 billion for 2020 and the company has said it expects 2021 revenue of between $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion. Dole, which had $4.7 billion in total assets as of Sept. 30, is looking to grow its business, including through bolt-on acquisitions, Mr. Davis said. 

     Total Produce, which was formed in 2006 after a split from banana-grower Fyffes PLC, has completed over 100 acquisitions since its inception, according to Mr. Davis, often by taking a minority stake and growing it over time. The combined Dole is now scouting the market for targets in the U.S. as well as in other countries and wants to acquire assets in fast growing categories, including avocados and berries. 

     The company is forecasting it can achieve $30 million to $40 million in annual synergies over a three- to five-year period in areas such as sourcing and shipping, Mr. Davis said. The company said the savings won't come from cuts to its more than 40,000 employee workforce. Dole also expects it will save about $40 million a year in interest costs after its recent refinancing. 

     Its leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio between net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stood at 2.76 times at the end of the third quarter, down from over 5 times before Total Produce became an investor, according to Mr. Davis. The combined company is targeting a leverage ratio of around 3 times, he said. 

     ""We have significant headroom to be able to do acquisitions,"" Mr. Davis said. The company reported net debt of $1.13 billion at the end of September, down from $1.51 billion at the close of March. 

     Dole will likely act as a consolidator in a fragmented market, said Roland French, an equity analyst at Davy Research, the research arm of the wealth management company Davy Group. 

     ""The IPO transaction allowed the company to de-lever the Dole balance sheet, which is a key part of the growth story in the context of driving future M&A,"" Mr. French said. Being part of a bigger entity will allow Dole to get better freight and procurement rates and drive revenue synergies, he added. 

     Like other food businesses, Dole is facing higher costs for labor and logistics. The company, which has raised prices on certain salads and fresh vegetables, is considering more increases if inflation persists, its finance chief said. ""Everybody in the wider industry is experiencing this,"" Mr. Davis said. 

     The company owns 13 container ships to transport bananas, pineapples and other products and operates 11 of those ships itself. 

     ""By owning and controlling our own fleet of ships and containers, we aren't as exposed as others,"" the CFO said, adding the company will continue to search for ways to offset recent cost increases.

   Omicron Starts to Slow U.S. Economy 

  Signs are mounting that the U.S. economy is losing some steam as the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus spreads rapidly through parts of the country. The number of diners seated at restaurants nationwide was down 15% in the week ended Dec. 22 from the same period in 2019, a steeper decline than in late November, data from reservations site OpenTable show. U.S. hotel occupancy was at 53.8% for the week ended Dec. 18, slightly below the previous week's level, according to STR, a global hospitality data and analytics company. Rising case numbers are leading many businesses to close for a short period, entertainment venues to cancel shows, universities to shift classes online and offices to delay or reverse reopening plans, Sarah Chaney Cambon and Harriet Torry report. 

  Still, low unemployment, substantial savings and briskly rising wages are giving Americans money to spend. Many are also eager to go out and gather with family after nearly two years of social-distancing protocols. For now, economists expect the highly contagious Omicron variant to cause a short-term soft patch for spending and broader economic growth. Many economists have lowered their growth projections for early 2022 due to growing concerns about the latest surge in coronavirus cases. But much of the difference in output could be delayed, rather than lost altogether.

  Consumer spending was strong heading into Omicron, and it will be after. The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that consumer spending rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in November from October and also revised its October spending figures higher. Digging into the data, the November increase was driven by a 0.9% gain in services expenditures. Spending on goods rose just 0.1%. And that is before the bite from inflation. While rising Covid-19 cases appear to be depressing activity this month, the Omicron surge won't last forever-indeed, given its very speed, and the recent experience of other countries, it might not last very long. In its aftermath, the shift in spending toward services and away from goods last month hints at what next year might look like. 2022 could be when demand for services really drives spending, and demand for goods moves to the passenger seat, Justin Lahart writes. 

  United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are canceling dozens of flights over the holiday weekend as a surge of Covid-19 cases impacts crews . Alaska Air Group said it canceled 17 flights Thursday after some employees reported they may have been exposed to the virus, and said it may have to cut more. Other carriers have cautioned in recent days that there could be worker shortages that disrupt operations, as the Omicron variant races across the U.S., Alison Sider reports. 

  After nearly two years of dealing with worker shortages, pandemic restrictions and rising prices, many small businesses are suddenly facing a surge of employee illnesses from the Omicron variant that is leading to some hard choices . Calls mount to cut Covid-19 quarantine period for fully vaccinated . 

  Worker filings for unemployment benefits hovered near the lowest level in more than half a century last week as a strong labor market kept layoffs low . Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, were unchanged at 205,000 in the week ended Dec. 18, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists warn, however, that the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the U.S. could push layoffs higher in the weeks ahead, particularly in the services sector, as consumers adjust travel and entertainment plans to reduce the risk of getting sick, Harriet Torry reports. 

  Travelers looking to rent cars are encountering higher rates and few choices, if they can find a car at all. The shortage of rental cars that emerged earlier this year has gotten worse as companies such as Hertz Global Holdings struggle to restock their fleets after selling off big chunks early in the pandemic, analysts and executives say. Leisure travel has also bounced back with more Americans vaccinated and booking trips, further taxing already limited availability, Nora Naughton reports. 

  Schools face food shortages amid supply-chain disruptions . 

  U.S. inflation last month rose at the fastest pace since 1982. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased 5.7% from one year earlier in November. Excluding often volatile food and energy prices, core inflation was up 4.7%, the sharpest annual increase since 1989. The PCE price index, which tends to run a little cooler than the better-known consumer-price index, is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. The Fed targets 2% annual price increases. 

  Purchases of new single-family houses in the U.S. rose in November as demand remained robust despite high prices. The Commerce Department said new-home sales increased 12.4% from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 744,000. One blemish on the report: October sales were revised sharply lower. And one sign of the times: The median price of a new home was $416,900 in November, a new record. This year for the first time monthly sales of new homes priced above $400,000 exceeded sales of those priced below $400,000. 

   Do They Know It's Christmas Time at All? 

  Streets have emptied and restaurants have closed in the U.K. as the Omicron variant breaks fresh records. Unlike previous lockdowns, however, there is no government mandate to stay home this time; people are hunkering down of their own accord , fearful of catching Covid-19 and being forced to spend Christmas in isolation. The cautious behavior is a blow for retailers and restaurants that had begun to recover from previous rounds of restrictions and were counting on strong trade over the festive period to see them through the coming months. It also highlights how voluntary responses to the virus can shape the trajectory of the pandemic and the approach of governments as they grapple with a new variant, Isabel Coles reports. 

   Turkey: What Could Possibly Go Wrong? 

  A new policy to relieve Turkey's currency crisis puts a spotlight on a historically robust area of the economy: the banks. Faith in the local banking system has remained resolute despite repeated currency depreciations, sackings of central bank chiefs and boom-bust cycles. The country's lenders are at the center of the government's rescue plan for the lira unveiled this week. The plan pays Turks to keep their bank deposits in lira and not pull money out of the banking system no matter what happens in currency markets. For now, the lira's selloff has calmed. But some are skeptical about the long-term prospects. Spiraling inflation and heavy dollarization in the banking system leave this major emerging market vulnerable, Caitlin Ostroff and Patricia Kowsmann report.

422,"Up &amp; Down Wall Street: It&apos;s the Best Market Run in Years. Why Is Everybody So Glum? -- Barron&apos;s

By Ben Levisohn 

     Misery may love company, but this is getting ridiculous. 

     If all you had to ponder were the numbers, you would assume that everyone would have fond memories of 2021. Jobs were plentiful. Economic growth was the strongest it had been in decades, and stock returns were out of this world. It's the kind of data that would have been celebrated just a few years ago. 

     Despite the New Year, Americans aren't celebrating -- they're mostly miserable. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment dropped 13%, to 70.6, in 2021, the lowest end-of year reading since 2008, when the world was in the throes of the global financial crisis. Unlike that year, when the S&P 500 index dropped 38%, the index is up by more than 27%. That's the largest stock market gain in a year when sentiment suffered a double-digit drop in at least 25 years. It's the kind of agony expected from a bunch of teenagers at a Cure concert, but it's hard to blame people for their gloom. 

     Covid-19 was supposed to be long gone by this point, or at least that's what we'd hoped as 2021 got under way. But a combination of vaccine reluctance, virus mutations, and other factors has meant that not only is the virus still with us, but also that the U.S. is ending the year with a record number of cases -- a seven-day average of 277,741, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data -- and little sign that the Omicron spike will let up anytime soon. That the disease appears to have become less deadly as it has mutated is easy to overlook, though it shouldn't be. 

     ""The outlook for Omicron remains the same, as cases continue to break records globally, but the lack of [a] sharp increase in hospitalizations is allowing stocks to rally into year end,"" writes the Sevens Report's Tom Essaye. 

     Surging inflation has also been weighing on Americans. The Federal Reserve, after all, promised that rising prices would be ""transitory,"" and yet here we are at the end of the year with the consumer price index climbing at its fastest annual rate since 1982, and even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said it's time to retire the word. 

     In the latest University of Michigan report, a fourth of respondents cited a hit to their living standards due to inflation. ""The hope of a brief and fleeting spurt in prices has been dashed,"" writes Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. ""Inflation pressures have broadened behind the handful of pandemic reopening categories and intensified."" 

     Still, it's rare to see such a disconnect between sentiment and the stock market. Since 1997, there have been 12 years of declining sentiment, with the S&P 500 finishing higher during seven of them. The decline in confidence during those years, however, was usually relatively small. The only year previous to 2020 when confidence suffered a double-digit decline and the market rose was in 2007, when a recession had already started, but the S&P 500 finished up 3%. Never has sentiment suffered double-digit declines for two years in a row only to see the S&P 500 rise by double digits in both years. 

     That suggests that perhaps there's a growing divide between what respondents say and what they do. Retail sales increased by 18.2% in November, year over year, while the most recent quits data from the Department of Labor was 2.8%, down from a record 3%, but still elevated. Even inflation might not be the problem that it appears to be, observes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. Google searches for words like ""discount,"" ""cheap,"" and ""coupon"" are declining, not rising. ""[As] much as U.S. consumers may think about inflation (and numerous surveys show they clearly do), they are not yet responding to higher prices by seeking out better deals,"" he writes. ""This is good news for U.S. corporate earnings power, especially among larger companies that also enjoy economies of scale and scope."" 

     Maybe so, but investors aren't feeling very good about the stock market either, despite -- or because of -- three consecutive years of double-digit gains. The latest American Association of Individual Investors sentiment survey shows that the percentage of bulls remained below 45% for a fifth straight week, despite the S&P 500 trading above its rising 50-day moving average, observes Sundial Capital Research's Jason Goepfert. When that has happened in the past, the S&P 500 has gone on to average a 4.6% gain over the next three months. 

     But just as consumers' pessimism isn't necessarily reflected in their actions, investors seem to be buying stocks despite a gloomy outlook -- and that should be good news for the market. ""The current low optimism, given a mostly healthy market environment, especially during this time of year, suggests higher prices,"" he writes. 

     Just don't expect it to be easy. 

     The Fed, after all, is cutting back its bond purchases, and the federal-fund futures market is pricing in a greater than 50% chance of a rate hike at the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. That's likely to inject a dose of volatility into the market. But with interest rates likely to remain below both the rate of inflation and the rate of economic growth, stocks should still be the place to be, writes Jefferies strategist Sean Darby, as long as the cost of credit relative to U.S. Treasuries doesn't get too expensive. 

     ""[Nominal] GDP will still be above government bond yields, ensuring equities outperform their peers, but a watchful eye on credit spreads will be the litmus test for owning the more challenging business models, "" he explains. 

     And if the market doesn't keep going up? At least investors will have something to be miserable about.

423,"EUROPEAN MIDDAY BRIEFING - Stocks Rise on Final Day of Tumultuous Month

  MARKET WRAPS 

  Stocks: 

  European stocks traded mostly higher after upbeat trading in Asia. 

  ""A decent start to the week for markets in Europe and Asia hopefully sets the tone for a better five-day trading session for investors, given the carnage we've seen for most of January,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 

  In the commodity space, crude prices continued their march higher, sitting at the highest levels since 2014. 

  ""There'll be a continued focus on the trajectory of oil prices over the week ahead, particularly with the OPEC+ group meeting on Wednesday to discuss a March production increase,"" said Reid. ""The geopolitical tensions out of Eastern Europe also helped drive oil prices higher, as Russia is one of the world's largest exporters."" 

  Stocks to watch: LVMH's unmatched earnings give it scope for continued investment in the fast-changing luxury sector, Credit Suisse said after last week's expectation-beating 2021 results. 

  The French luxury goods major booked yearly operating profit of EUR17 billion, multiple times higher than what most peers can expect, and this looks sustainable as the core fashion division's high margins solidify, CS said. 

  This gives the group firepower for investment in product and marketing and to tap new sales opportunities, the bank added. Sales growth should normalize in 2022 as comparables get tougher, but should nevertheless reach double digits organically in the year, CS said, keeping an outperform rating on LVMH stock and raising its target to EUR800 from EUR720. 

  Low-cost carrier Ryanair's 3Q saw an improvement in pricing despite December's Omicron-related restrictions as its EUR25 average fare was only around 24% below 2019's 3Q, an improvement from the 31% difference in the 2Q comparison, Citi said. 

  However, pricing in 4Q would have been hurt by late Christmas and new year bookings and the Omicron coronavirus, the U.S. bank said. 

  Citi now expects net income loss for fiscal 2022 to be EUR366 million, compared with a prior net loss expectation of EUR367 million, with earnings estimates for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025 rising by more than 6%, 1%, and 4%, respectively, the bank said. Citi rates the stock buy with a EUR20 target price. 

  Pearson's acquisition of digital-credentialing firm Credly for a total firm value of $200 million is a sensible move and should be well received, Citi said. 

  The FTSE 100 education company's acquisition coherently expands its suite of services in what is currently an underscale professional learning operation, and at a group level it underlines the shift of emphasis away from higher education--something of a monomaniacal focus for the market, the U.S. bank said. 

  Pearson using its financial net cash position of around GBP200 million to accelerate its business mix shift also makes good financial sense, Citi added. Citi retains its buy rating on Pearson's stock. Shares are down 0.4% at 604.0 pence. 

  Data in focus: The absolute majority secured by the Portuguese socialist party, led by Prime Minister Antonio Costa, in Sunday's parliamentary election is likely to be positive for the country's economy, economists from Berenberg said. 

  Costa will now be able to pass the budget, and Portugal can begin to spend its 16.6 billion euros in EU recovery funds, which could lift the country's GDP be between 1.5% and 2.4% by 2026, they said. 

  Portugal's household median net income remains among the lowest in the eurozone, and Costa wants to increase income per worker, but will continue to safeguard the country's fiscal stability, Berenberg said. ""With largely sensible economic policies, Portugal can stay on a solid recovery track,"" the German bank said. 

  Germany's inflation is expected to ease to 4.7% on year in January, following a reading of 5.3% in December. This would be the first decline in the yearly rate since June 2021. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast German inflation at 4.3% in January. 

  One key driver of the deceleration is likely to have been the unwinding of the VAT effect that drove up inflation rates significantly last year, the Italian bank said. 

  ""A stronger deceleration is likely to have been prevented by energy companies passing on markedly higher electricity and natural-gas prices to consumers,"" UniCredit said. 

  Following the release of North-Rhine Westphalia's inflation data, which showed 5.1% inflation in January, UniCredit said the deceleration may be even more slight. 

  U.S. Markets: 

  Stock futures crept higher Monday, but major indexes are poised to close January with heavy losses following a month of volatile trading due to expected interest-rate increases. 

  ""There has been extreme volatility so far this year,"" said Louise Dudley, an equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. ""People are particularly worried with the interest-rate expectations continuing to get higher. We're definitely seeing from the U.S. that they're very on top of the inflation numbers-they're going to do everything they can."" 

  Ms. Dudley said she expects that volatility will lessen as investors get more clarity over whether inflation has peaked and how companies expect to be impacted by higher prices for energy, labor and materials. Earnings are due ahead of Monday's market open from Otis Worldwide and L3Harris Technologies. 

  ""Companies are managing at the moment to hit their expectations, but it's the outlooks that have definitely got a big cautious question mark on them and people are worried about how much further some of these costs will go,"" she said. 

  In the week ahead, the U.S. jobs report Friday will be a highlight. The Fed is closely watching employment data as it considers higher inflation and monetary policy. 

  And with corporate earnings season in full swing, company results will also be in the spotlight. More than 110 constituents of the S&P 500 report this week, with NXP Semiconductors in the day ahead. Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Exxon Mobil, and General Motors, are among many other big names that will report in the coming days. 

  Forex: 

  The dollar was slightly lower after last week's rally but declines should remain limited due to speculation about the Fed tightening monetary policy at a faster pace, ING said. 

  ""Mild consolidation could see [the DXY dollar index] briefly break under 97.05 to the 96.85 area--that should hold, however,"" ING analysts said. 

  While most of this week's U.S. economic data for January could miss expectations, this weakness caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant is well understood by the market and investors are more influenced by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's ""very hawkish"" comments at last Wednesday's meeting, they said. 

  The Bank of England could raise interest rates further on Thursday but this might not lift sterling, RBC Capital Markets said. 

  The BOE is likely to raise its key rate 25 basis points to 0.50%, the level at which it plans to start reducing its stock of purchased assets, RBC currency strategist Adam Cole said. 

  ""The market is not currently appreciating how that interaction between Bank Rate and balance sheet reduction means this will not be a normal tightening cycle and that current pricing for Bank Rate is too aggressive,"" he said. That could weigh on sterling over the medium term, he said. 

  Short-sellers built bets against sterling in the week to Jan. 25 despite expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates again this Thursday, Rabobank said, citing the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

  ""The money market has been positioned for a fair amount of tightening this year,"" Rabobank forex strategist Jane Foley said. ""That said, fears of a spike in the cost of living in the U.K. questions whether the BOE will be able to match these expectations."" 

  Bitcoin was struggling to recover as it remains below the key $40,000 level but the weakness won't last, AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam said. 

  ""With mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies on the rise, by institutional investors and individuals alike, and backed by strong fundamentals, the future outlook of cryptocurrencies remains positive,"" he said. 

  Bitcoin falls 2.3% on the day to $37,213 but has recouped some of its losses since hitting a six-month low of $32,983 last Monday, according to CoinDesk. 

  Bonds: 

  The European Central Bank's rate decision on Thursday should be neutral for European credit markets, though inflation data due the day before could hurt market sentiment, UniCredit said. 

  ""While we expect that the ECB will not make any policy changes at the meeting, which should... be credit neutral, inflation concerns remain high and are likely to weigh on market sentiment,"" analysts at the bank said. They advise clients to stick to bonds maturing between three and five years to reduce price volatility. 

  The Bank of England may find itself, like the Fed last week, unable to rule out consecutive interest-rate rises this Thursday, Mizuho said. ""The message may be similar as that from the Fed,"" analysts said, adding that it will be difficult for BOE Governor Andrew Bailey to rule out hiking scenarios when the questions inevitably come. 

  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments signaling that the Fed could raise rates several times in consecutive months prompted investors to dump stocks and bonds. 

  The BOE is expected to lift the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% this Thursday, which would trigger a stop to the reinvestments of proceeds of maturing gilts and open the door to a further rate rise in March. 

  The Italian presidential election has resulted in the most market-friendly outcome, with Sergio Mattarella remaining president and Mario Draghi as prime minister, nonetheless, Italian risk premia is expected to widen moderately this year, Oliver Eichmann, head of rates for EMEA fixed income at DWS, said. 

  ""With a view to the further development of the risk premium on Italian government bonds, we nevertheless expect a moderate widening over a 12-month horizon,"" he said.

424,"Rising Interest Rates Hit Municipal- Bonds Market -- WSJ

By Heather Gillers 

     Municipal bonds are off to their worst start since 2011. 

     The early-year bond rout has dragged returns on the S&P Municipal Bond Index to minus 1.1% through Jan. 20, counting price changes and interest payments. The loss is an early sign that rising interest rates could make 2022 rockier than last year, when federal stimulus and elevated demand from homebound savers led to record low volatility and historically high prices. 

     Now investors are eyeing those prices more warily. Muni bond mutual and exchange-traded funds took in a net $830 million through Jan. 19, compared with $6.1 billion last year, according to Refinitiv Lipper. After Fed officials indicated they could lift short-term rates sooner than expected, muni yields jumped alongside Treasury yields, with 10-year AAA muni yields rising to 1.28% Jan. 20 from 1.03% Dec. 30, according to Refinitiv Municipal Market Data. Yields rise as bond prices fall. 

     State and local governments issue long-term debt in the roughly $4 trillion muni market, typically for capital projects such as highways and schools. Affluent investors prize munis because most throw off interest that is exempt from federal, and often state, taxes. 

     But rising interest rates make outstanding bonds with comparatively lower yield less attractive, a worrisome possibility for anyone holding or buying muni debt. They also increase borrowing costs for state and local governments, whose tax-exempt borrowing fell to $9.2 billion this year through Jan. 20, a four-year low. The city of Greenwich, Conn., issued one-year debt at a net interest cost of 0.21% in the first week of January, up from 0.12% last January, according to Comptroller Peter Mynarski. 

     Some analysts also expect a drop off in demand for munis this year because of an anticipated slowdown in household savings, which increased during the pandemic, especially for the wealthy. 

     The appetite for tax-exempt debt has long exceeded yearly issuance. The imbalance grew over the past year as higher-income Americans moved savings and the windfalls they got from blockbuster stock gains into municipal bonds. Analysts don't expect those inflows to continue at the same pace this year. 

     Creditworthiness could become more of an issue for some struggling cities in 2022 as they continue to spend down waves of federal pandemic aid. That aid, as well as tax revenues from purchases made with stimulus checks and stimulus-fueled stock gains, helped strengthen municipal credit in 2021, when public-finance upgrades slightly outpaced downgrades by Fitch Ratings. In 2020, Fitch did 80% more downgrades than upgrades, as the pandemic shut down local economies and strained services. 

     Sustained inflation also could aggravate credit woes, because it would drive up the cost of government projects, services and cost-of-living adjusted retirement benefits, some analysts said. 

     ""How good is muni credit if the baseline of the budget has to go up 5%"" several years in a row? asked Adam Stern, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors. ""Some places can handle it, other places probably can't."" 

     Default is extremely rare in the municipal market. But debt issued by strapped borrowers tends to fall in price under adverse financial conditions, driving down the value of investors' portfolios and creating a dilemma for those who want to cash out. 

     In some ways, the increased potential for volatility in 2022 marks a return to a more familiar investment environment after a year of unusual calm, which followed a year of Covid-related upheaval. After a liquidity crisis in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic, the muni market in 2021 had a record 113 days when yields on AAA intermediate maturity bonds didn't change from the day before, according to data from Municipal Market Analytics. 

     The year ""2020 was abnormal in terms of volatility,"" said Michael Zezas, municipal strategist and head of U.S. public policy research at Morgan Stanley. ""2021 was abnormally calm. This is a return to normal.""

  S&P 500 and Dow lose 1% as investors adjust portfolios for higher interest rates 

By Gunjan Banerji and Joe Wallace 

     U.S. stocks gave up early gains and turned lower, extending a recent stretch of losses that have pulled major indexes down to start the year. 

     The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 166.64 points, or 1.1%, to 14340.26. It finished the day 10.7% below its all-time closing high, set in November. A decline of greater than 10% is considered a correction for a stock index. 

     The S&P 500 fell 44.35 points, or 1%, to 4532.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 339.82 points, or 1%, to 35028.65. 

     Wednesday's trading activity continued a tumultuous stretch for major indexes, with stocks paring their earlier gains and closing near session lows. In the first weeks of January, many investors have started dumping shares of technology companies and piling into other corners of the market in anticipation of rising interest rates. Some investors are positioning for the Covid-19 pandemic to turn into an endemic. 

     Investors have stepped up bets that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks will tighten monetary policy in the coming months, withdrawing a pillar of support for markets. Mounting expectations of interest-rate rises follow evidence that the drivers of inflation have broadened beyond the supply-chain shock that fueled price gains for much of 2021. 

     That has led to big swings, leaving many stocks in a bear market and stoking giant rotations among different sectors. 

     Recent volatility is  ""really all about inflation and how aggressive central banks are going to be to counteract it,"" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Asset Management, adding that inflation could also curtail economic growth by knocking consumption. ""Certainly, the market is nervous at the moment,"" he said. 

     Government-bond prices edged up Wednesday, pushing down yields. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.826% from 1.866% Tuesday, which was their highest level since January 2020. Yields on interest-rate-sensitive two-year notes were down to 1.022% from 1.038% Tuesday. 

     The moves in the bond market have rippled through stocks, and particularly the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite is down 8% this year, a much sharper decline than the S&P or Dow industrials. 

     ""There is currently a knee-jerk reaction occurring in the market"" in response to rising bond yields, said Dev Kantesaria, founder of Valley Forge Capital. 

     And there are signs that individual investors -- a key force behind 2021's stock-market rally -- are cooling on tech, according to analysts at Vanda Research. Retail investors have been buying shares of financials and energy companies, while their purchases of highflying stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia have been dwindling, Vanda said. 

     Other corners of the market have staged a strong rally. The S&P 500's value index has been outperforming its growth index by around 7.4 percentage points this month, on pace for the biggest monthly outperformance since December 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

     Some of the biggest lenders in the U.S. reported rising earnings. Bank of America shares rose 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $46.44 after the lender reported a jump in fourth-quarter profits. Morgan Stanley's shares gained $1.72, or 1.8%, to $95.73, after profits that topped forecasts. 

     U.S. Bancorp fell almost 8% after the bank holding company posted a rise in compensation costs. This earnings season, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have also reported shelling out more in compensation. 

     Procter & Gamble said consumers were undeterred by higher prices, leading to higher revenue and lifting shares of the consumer-goods company around 3.4%. 

     Over the next week, investors will be parsing earnings from big tech companies including Netflix and Microsoft. Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., said he'll be closely tracking the results to see what guidance executives provide for future quarters. 

     ""I'm hoping for them to not come out and guide lower,"" Mr. Morgan said. 

     Elsewhere, Europe's most closely watched government-bond yield turned positive for the first time since 2019. The yield on 10-year German bund rose as high as 0.021% Wednesday after trading in negative territory for over 30 months. 

     Oil prices rose. Brent crude futures rose 1.1% to $88.44, hitting the highest level since October 2014. Wednesday's moves extend a rally driven in part by the potential for supply disruptions in Russia and the Middle East. 

     Overseas stock markets were mixed following Tuesday's selloff on Wall Street. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2%. Asian stocks came under pressure, with Japan's Nikkei 225 skidding 2.8%. China's Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.3%.

427,"German Consumer Confidence Is Expected to Continue Its Downward Trend

 

  By Maria Martinez 

 

  Consumer sentiment in Germany is expected to decline again in March, after an increase in February, due to a sharp rise in coronavirus infection rates at the time of the survey and high inflation, according to GfK. 

  ""Expectations of a significant easing in price trends at the beginning of the year have been shattered for the time being, as inflation rates continue to hover at a high level,"" Rolf Buerkl, consumer expert at the market-research group, said in a press release Wednesday. 

  GfK's forward-looking consumer sentiment index forecasts confidence among households falling to minus 8.1 in March from minus 6.7 in February. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a rise to minus 6.4 points. 

  GfK uses data from three subindexes from the current month to derive a sentiment figure for the coming month, measuring consumers' economic expectations, income expectations and propensity to buy. In February, there was a mixed picture: While economic expectations increased somewhat, income expectations and the propensity to buy had losses compared with the previous month. 

  Economic expectations rose to 24.1 in February from 22.8 in January. The outlook for the coming months is quite positive as it was recently decided to lift pandemic restrictions, GfK said. 

  ""This gives cause for hope that consumer spending will also return as a result,"" Mr. Buerkl said. 

  However, the income expectations indicator dropped to 3.9 in February from 16.9 in January, the lowest value in over a year, according to GfK. 

  Inflation is the greatest current threat to income expectations as high prices for energy and food are weakening purchasing power, the market-research group said. 

  Propensity to buy fell to 1.4 in February from 5.2 in January, GfK's data showed. 

  ""Despite the current decline in propensity to buy, the future expectations for a recovery of consumer sentiment are quite favorable,"" GfK said.

  U.S. National Debt Exceeds $30 Trillion for First Time 

  WASHINGTON-The U.S. national debt exceeded $30 trillion for the first time, reflecting increased federal borrowing during the coronavirus pandemic. 

  Total public debt outstanding was $30.01 trillion as of Jan. 31, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday. That was a nearly $7 trillion increase from late January 2020, just before the pandemic hit the U.S. economy.

  To look at stock valuations, the pandemic might never have happened. 

  On Monday, the U.S. market closed its worst month since March 2020, with the S&P 500 falling 5.3%. The index has now lost all of its price gains since mid-October. The technology-heavy Nasdaq has retreated further, because the sectors that have performed worse are those more affected by higher interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has said will be a reality this year.

  The Labor Department on Tuesday said there were 10.9 million job openings in December, up slightly from 10.8 million the previous month. Meanwhile, the number of times workers quit fell to 4.3 million in December, from a record 4.5 million. Hiring slowed to 6.3 million, down from 6.6 million.

  Retail prices rose 1.5% on year in January after climbing 0.8% in December, marked by a significant increase in nonfood prices. 

   
 
 

  Exxon, Chevron Hit Gushers of Cash as Big Oil Companies Lure Back Investors 

  The world's big Western oil companies are back in the money and once again attracting strong interest from investors as crude prices rise to their highest levels in years. 

  Exxon Mobil Corp. on Tuesday reported $23 billion in profit for 2021, its highest total since 2014, including $8.9 billion in profit in the fourth quarter. Last week, Chevron Corp. reported its most profitable year since 2014, earning $15.6 billion in net income in 2021 and $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter. The largest European oil companies, Shell PLC and BP PLC, are expected to also post resurgent annual results when they report in the coming days. 

   
 
 

  Putin Says West 'Basically Ignored' His Demands in Ukraine Standoff 

  KYIV, Ukraine-President Vladimir Putin of Russia said the U.S. and its European allies had ""basically ignored"" Moscow's demands for security assurances but expressed a willingness to continue talks as Russian troops maneuvered near Ukraine's borders and Kyiv rushed to bolster its defenses. 

  ""We didn't see an adequate response to our key concerns,"" Mr. Putin told reporters Tuesday at a Kremlin press conference at which he again castigated the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for what he has portrayed as a persistent eastward push that threatens Moscow. 

   
 
 

  Google Parent Caps Blockbuster Year With Sales Gains 

  Google parent Alphabet Inc. posted another quarter of strong sales growth, capping a year when profit nearly doubled despite mounting regulatory pressure that threatens the search giant's future. 

  The company's dominance in online search, video and internet ad sales made it one of last year's leading beneficiaries of an upswing in digital advertising. Last year, small and large businesses alike flooded into the ad market in a bid to win customers who spent early parts of the pandemic sequestered in their homes.

429,"Russia&apos;s Ukraine Invasion Chokes Food Exports From Global Breadbasket -- WSJ

By Will Horner, Alistair MacDonald and Chao Deng 

     Russia's invasion of Ukraine throttled exports from one of the world's largest grain suppliers after the country's ports went quiet and traders halted operations. 

     At stake is the 13% of global corn exports and the 12% of wheat that flow from Ukraine. In threatening those flows Moscow risks disrupting supplies to China while setting off a scramble among customers in fragile Middle Eastern economies at a time when food inflation is already high. 

     Missiles and airstrikes have battered cities throughout Ukraine, including port cities key to the country's agricultural exports. Commercial shipping in and out of the country has largely ground to a halt. 

     An ocean vessel chartered by one of the world's largest food suppliers, Cargill Inc., was hit by a projectile off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday. Minnesota-based Cargill, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is seaworthy and no one was injured. 

     U.S. grains giants have also begun closing operations. Archer Daniels Midland Co. closed its facilities in Ukraine, which include a grain terminal at a port near Odessa. Bunge Ltd. also closed its offices and facilities in Ukraine. 

     Wheat futures traded in Chicago have jumped almost 12% so far this week, hitting their highest level since July 2012. European wheat prices have soared 15% for the week. 

     Russia's incursions in the south and in the east strike at the heart of Ukraine's most productive wheat-growing regions, which stretch across the country's southern half, from Kharkiv on the eastern border with Russia to Odessa on the country's Black Sea coastline. 

     The fighting shouldn't have much impact on the planting or harvesting of crops, according to Mike Lee, owner of Green Square Agro Consulting, a crop forecasting company that specializes in the Black Sea region. Wheat, for instance, is planted in September and October and harvested in July and the following months. 

     ""Whatever happens, there is a crop in the ground,"" he said. 

     Still, if the situation on the ground escalates to a position where farmers can't apply pesticides or fertilizers to their wheat, which will start in March, that could reduce the yield by up to a third, presuming they can harvest in July, Mr. Lee said. 

     While a large portion of crops are exported around the time they are harvested, cargoes will leave Ukraine throughout the year, he said. Over 700,000 metric tons of wheat are exported during each of the months of February, March and April, according to government statistics. That is well below the 3.64 million and 4.5 million tons exported in August and September respectively, but enough to disturb crop supply chains. Damaged infrastructure and port congestion could also affect trading well into the year. 

     Shipping in the Azov Sea -- an extension of the Black Sea to the east of Crimea -- has stopped. Ships are banned from passing through the narrow Kerch Strait into the shallow sea, and ship-tracking data showed dozens of ships, including the bulk carriers that transport grains, had anchored in the strait. 

     Russian and Ukrainian ports on the Azov Sea export up to 18 million tons of grains each year, said Andrey Sizov, managing director of SovEcon, a Russian research firm focusing on Black Sea grains. 

     Damage to port infrastructure or a Russian naval blockade would also threaten the much larger Ukrainian ports around Odessa and Mykolaiv. Ports around the two cities handle upward of 50 million metric tons of grain each year and are crucial to Ukraine's agricultural industry, said Mr. Sizov. 

     Simon Arnold, co-founder of Dubai-based Aria Commodities, said his trading firm would hold off from trading grains in Ukraine for at least a month or until the situation appears resolved. 

     Disruptions to Ukraine's grain trade will also be difficult for its main customers, as the world already swallows food-price inflation. 

     Beijing has made Ukraine a centerpiece of its efforts to diversify grain supplies and increase food security. Chinese demand for corn is at a record high after Beijing encouraged domestic producers to pile into hog production. 

     Ukraine exported a record 8.2 million tons of corn to China in 2021, making up nearly 30% of total Chinese corn imports. Ukraine accounted for as much as 86% of Chinese corn imports in 2019. Ukraine also exports barley and sunflower oil to China. 

     Disruptions to Ukrainian corn exports come at an especially difficult time for Chinese pork producers, who have been losing money as hog prices drop. 

     Egypt and Indonesia are the largest buyers of Ukrainian wheat, each accounting for more than 15% of Ukraine's wheat imports, or more than 3 million tons, according to data from Trade Data Monitor. Other major buyers are Turkey and Pakistan, which each imported 1.7 million and 1.3 million tons of wheat, respectively, from Ukraine in 2021. 

     For Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, access to affordable wheat is a question of political stability. Rallying prices have led to street protests, including ones in 2011 during the Arab Spring, which toppled the government of Hosni Mubarak. 

     On Thursday, Egypt canceled an international tender to buy wheat after receiving just one bid amid the uncertainty surrounding Black Sea grains supplies. Egypt's import agency typically receives between 10 and 20 bids in its closely watched tenders. 

     For Ukraine itself, the agricultural sector is one of the key bright spots of its economy. The yellow in the country's flag symbolizes its crop fields. 

     Any disruption to its grains trade will be painful. With more than 41 million hectares of agricultural land, covering 70% of the country, agriculture is Ukraine's largest export and the largest part of its economy, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year, according to the country's statistics service. 

     Last year the Ukrainian government changed its laws to allow hundreds of thousands of small and medium-size farmers to buy and sell land. That allowed them to borrow money on the land they had, and invest those proceeds. 

     The U.S. and European governments had already zeroed in on agriculture as a way to develop the Ukrainian economy. The U.S. Agency for International Development, for instance, says it has provided around $13 million since late 2019 to support the passage of these laws and educate farmers in how to take advantage of the changes. 

     Even before the invasion, geopolitical tensions were putting pressure on Ukrainian farmers. 

     Larissa Boden, whose business Agro-focus Ltd was planting its next crop of asparagus last week, has seen a 30% increase in the price of fuel. A bank that Agro-focus, the country's largest asparagus farmer, had been negotiating a loan with has now put those talks on hold. Ms. Boden, who farms in the south close to Crimea, was also concerned that war would mean the seasonal workers farms depend upon would leave to work in more stable countries. 

     On Thursday, after hearing explosions in the early morning, she said she stayed indoors and off her fields.

430,"Tech Trader: DoorDash Delivered The Biggest Surprise Of Earnings Season -- Barron&apos;s

By Eric J. Savitz 

     As the world emerges from the pandemic, tech investors have been struggling to answer a fundamental question: Which consumer behaviors developed over the past two years will stick -- and which will prove to have been fleeting Covid-era trends? The back and forth has played out throughout earnings season, from Peloton and Netflix's disappointments to Microsoft and Apple's home runs. 

     The bottom line is that no one's going back to 2019 patterns; we're all shaping a new normal. Working from home is no longer a temporary measure -- the phenomenon is changing the labor force. (I put more miles on my road bike last year than on my car and suspect I will do the same in 2022.) Business travel appears permanently reduced, with some meetings and trade events likely to remain online, where costs are lower and access is higher. 

     While weeks of earnings reports have generally created more questions than answers, this past week brought one bit of clarity: Results from DoorDash (ticker: DASH) showed that food delivery is one pandemic habit that's likely to stick. 

     To be clear, the stock market is littered with reopening casualties, and DoorDash hasn't been immune from the downdraft. 

     With interest rates on the rise, investors have steered away from companies with high multiples and a lack of profits. Wall Street has dealt especially severe punishment to any company coping with postpandemic slowdowns. 

     Zoom Video Communications (ZM) hit a 52-week low this past week. The stock has now essentially erased its Covid-era rally, falling more than 75% from an October 2020 peak. 

     Shares of Shopify (SHOP), the e-commerce software pioneer, continued to fall this past week after executives offered cautious commentary about the business amid inflation worries and product shortages. There are also signs that people are going back to physical stores for at least some purchases. Shopify shares lost 23% on the week, extending their slide to 60% since a November peak. 

     DocuSign (DOCU) is down 63% from its pandemic peak because of slowing growth in its e-signature business, while video-tools provider Vimeo (VMEO) is down 77% since spinning off from IAC/Interactive (IACI) last May. Even Netflix (NFLX), a winner long before the pandemic, hasn't been immune. Shares of the streaming pioneer are off 44% on slowing subscriber growth. 

     So, the idea that food delivery would be one of the lasting winners from the pandemic is a bit surprising -- and the volatility in DoorDash stock suggests that skepticism remained high heading into earnings. DoorDash came public in December 2020, smack in the middle of the pandemic. The company's initial public offering priced at $102 a share, opened at $182, and closed that first day at $189.51. But the stock got caught in the recent tech downdraft, plunging more than 60% from its November 2021 peak of $245, to a recent price around $96. 

     Last week's earnings report provided some positive signals. Revenue for the December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter were both a bit ahead of Wall Street estimates, and there was especially encouraging user data. Monthly average users in the quarter grew 22% from a year ago, to a record 25 million. Total orders were up 35% to 369 million, and gross order volume was 36% higher at $11.2 billion. 

     In a research note, Wells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald noted that DoorDash accounts for just 5% of U.S. restaurant industry sales, with those 25 million people accounting for a single-digit percentage of the population. Fitzgerald, who has an Overweight rating and $170 target on the stock, sees ""plenty of runway"" ahead, with new growth opportunities in advertising, international markets, and delivery of goods beyond restaurant meals. 

     The company is also making a growing push to turn meal delivery into a habit. The company has more than 10 million members for its DashPass plan, up by a million members in the latest quarter. 

     The program has an Amazon Prime--like effect on DoorDash's business -- members are more loyal and tend to order more meals. DoorDash is pursuing partnerships with corporate accounts to make DashPass an employee perk -- News Corp, the parent company of Barron's publisher Dow Jones, now offers free DashPass membership to employees. 

     Robert Mollins, an analyst at Gordon Haskett and another DoorDash bull, writes that investors were worried about tough comparisons heading into the quarter, along with Uber's (UBER) recent comment that it had gained market share in food delivery. 

     DoorDash deflected all of those concerns with its strong results, impressive guidance, and market-share gains of its own. Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney, another DoorDash bull, thinks the market may be consolidating into two market leaders -- Uber Eats and DoorDash. 

     So, is DoorDash now a bargain? Wall Street certainly thinks so -- the average analyst target is about twice the current stock price. While still generating losses, DoorDash expects to turn profitable in 2023. 

     Meanwhile, the stock now trades for a relatively modest fives times estimated 2023 sales, which is about in line with Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), and cheaper than the seven times you'll pay for the wizard of burgertech, McDonald's (MCD). Risks remain -- and Uber is cheaper still, at a little over two times sales -- but the food-delivery business is just getting going.

431,"Brazil Inflation Accelerates in Month Through Mid-February on School Costs

 

  By Jeffrey T. Lewis 

 

  SÃO PAULO--Brazil's accelerated in the month through mid-February after education prices jumped at the start of the country's school year. 

  Consumer prices rose 0.99% from Jan. 16 through Feb. 15, the fastest pace for that period since 2016, and rose 10.76% from a year earlier, Brazil's Institute of Geography and Statistics, or IBGE, said Wednesday. Consumer prices rose 0.58% in the month through mid-January and increased 10.20% in the 12 months through mid-January. 

  Brazilian schools raise the cost of tuition every year at the start of the school year, and the cost of school supplies usually rise as well. Education costs increased 5.64% from the month through mid-January, after an increase of 0.25% in the previous period. 

  The price of food also increased more rapidly in the month, by 1.20% from 0.97% in the previous period, while transportation costs, including fuel, rose 0.87% in the month through mid-February after declining 0.41% in the month through mid-January.

432,"War in Ukraine Is Already Taking Its Toll on Global Food Supplies -- WSJ

By Alistair MacDonald 

     Ukrainian farmer Igor Borisov has 2,000 metric tons of corn from the fall harvest stuck in a warehouse behind Russian battle lines. Like other farmers across Ukraine, his crop for this year is also imperiled. 

     Global concerns that Russia's invasion would curtail Ukraine's 2022 harvest have come to fruition. The crop shortfall will extend to the many countries that rely on Ukraine for wheat, corn and cooking oil. 

     With wheat already in the ground, and only a few weeks left to plant corn, farmers in Ukraine can't get needed fertilizers and chemicals. They are low on fuel for tractors and other farm equipment. Workers are quitting to join the fight or to leave the country, leaving farms short-handed. 

     Mr. Borisov said he and other farmers need to start their corn, sunflower and barley crops in April and May. That is now in doubt, and the impact on food supplies and prices will be felt world-wide. 

     ""We hope we will plant, and we want to plant, but the situation is totally unpredictable,"" Mr. Borisov said. ""You cannot build a forecast on Vladimir Putin."" 

     Ukraine's nutrient-rich soils yield 10% of global wheat exports, 14% of corn exports and about half of the world's sunflower oil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In just three weeks, war disrupted Ukraine agriculture, triggering higher prices as well as the threat of global shortages. Much of the exports go to developing economies already struggling with food-cost inflation. 

     Mr. Borisov's farm is close to the border with Russia, in an area that was overrun on the first day of fighting. He had been away when the Russians invaded. His parents, who live close to his farm, called him to say hundreds of tanks were moving past the fields. 

     Russia's naval blockade and fighting around Ukraine ports has all but stopped maritime shipping and left limited means for transporting goods. Wheat prices have hit record levels over the effect on Ukrainian and Russian shipments. 

     Like Ukraine's military efforts, the country's agriculture sector is rallying. Exports are being rerouted, and Ukraine is asking the U.S., Poland, France and others for supplies, said Taras Vysotskyi, Ukraine's deputy minister of agrarian policy and food. In the best case scenario, the country's agricultural exports will fall by a fifth this year compared with 2021, he said, but a much bigger drop is more likely. 

     Should Russian forces leave immediately, Dmitry Skorniakov said, his four farms would still struggle to resume work. Tractors, chemical sprayers and a grain silo were destroyed on one farm located close to the besieged city of Mariupol, he said. Some of his workers have left to join the country's defense. 

     Further along the Black Sea coast, Larissa Boden's asparagus farm, Ukraine's largest, is in territory now held by Russia. Neighboring farms in what is one of Ukraine's most important growing regions have had fields chewed up by tanks and artillery fire, she said. 

     Ms. Boden planned to take delivery of 340,000 asparagus crowns from the Netherlands to plant more crops by April. She made a down payment of EUR78,000, about $85,500. After the invasion, she canceled the order and asked the supplier to try to sell them elsewhere. 

     Like Mr. Skorniakov, she fears she won't have enough workers. ""We don't have people,"" Ms. Boden said, ""we have tanks."" 

     The government of Ukraine, whose flag is said to depict a blue sky over a yellow field, has made farmworkers largely exempt from conscripted military service. Many are joining anyway. 

     Even on Mr. Skorniakov's farm near the comparatively peaceful border with Poland, his remaining farm hands are able to do less than 60% of the work, he said. Fertilizers and chemicals haven't been delivered, Mr. Skorniakov said. Fuel he typically buys from Russia and Belarus is unattainable. 

     ""It's a disaster,"" he said. 

     On track 

     Ukraine is the world's fourth and fifth largest exporter of corn and wheat, respectively, according to the USDA, and 85% of its crop exports travel by sea, said Mr. Vysotskyi, the government minister. 

     With ports closed, the country is trying to shift some exports through its Western borders. Around 25% to 30% are now heading to Romania, Poland and Slovakia by train and on to other ports, Mr. Vysotskyi said. 

     It is an imperfect solution. Ukraine's railways don't accommodate as high a volume of crops as ports can, and grains must be transferred to different train cars at the border because Ukraine's Soviet-era railways use a different gauge than those in the European Union. The shipping detours will add 10% to 15% to the cost of crops, Mr. Vysotskyi said. 

     The war in Ukraine is inflating global food prices that are already at decade highs, largely from the pandemic's lingering supply-chain troubles. Wheat futures are up 42% so far this year; the price of corn has risen 27%. 

     Worsening food supply prospects, Russia, also a major grain exporter, is struggling to get its crops out of the Black Sea. JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimated a decline of 60% in Russian grain shipments in the second week of March compared with the typical volume for that period in past years. 

     Grain is used for animal feed, and the supply interruptions have already hit the meat industry. ""We are seeing massive increases in the price of milk and meat, and this is not short-term,"" said Chris Elliott, a professor and expert on international food supply chains at Queens University, Belfast. 

     New bounty 

     Over the past two decades, the world's wheat trade has almost doubled, in large part because of stepped-up exports from Ukraine and Russia, according to the Agricultural Market Information System, a Group of 20 global food policy initiative. As recently as 15 years ago, Ukraine's grain exports were less than 7% of the country's 2020 total, according to government statistics. 

     An estimated 25 countries source at least half of their supplies from the two countries, according to AMIS. ""It is obviously disconcerting that some countries rely so strongly on Russia and or Ukraine for their wheat supplies,"" said Denis Drechsler, a project manager for the group. 

     Today, more than 41 million hectares of agricultural land cover 70% of Ukraine. Agriculture is the largest part of the Ukrainian economy, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year. 

     It wasn't always that way. When Kees Huizinga arrived in Ukraine 20 years ago, straight from Dutch agriculture college, he saw potential in the country's many abandoned fields. 

     Mr. Huizinga farms wheat, barley and sugar beet, and raises livestock in central Ukraine. Three weeks ago, he paid the equivalent of 80 cents for a liter of gas. Now, it is $1.65, he said, ""If you can even get your hands on it."" 

     Mr. Huizinga said he needs to plant his corn within three weeks. His farm has enough fuel for maybe three-quarters of a regular crop. The shortage of chemicals and fertilizers also will diminish crop yields, he said. 

     Farmers reported having, on average, only 20% of the fuel they needed, according to an online government poll of 1,700 farmers, who represented 15% of Ukraine's arable land. 

     At around 5 a.m. on Feb. 24, the first day of the Russian invasion, Mr. Huizinga said he heard what sounded like a jet fighter flying high above his farm. Then he felt the windows and doors shudder. A Russian missile struck an ammunition dump. 

     ""Soon, what is a disaster for farmers here will become one for elsewhere in the world,"" Mr. Huizinga said, ""when they can't get our food.""

433,"Capital Spending Boom Helps Raise Productivity, Contain Costs -- WSJ

By David Harrison 

     American businesses are ramping up technology investment and other capital spending as they emerge from the pandemic. If sustained, that investment boom could boost productivity and living standards and counteract inflation pressure. 

     Private nonresidential business investment grew 7.4% in 2021 from the previous year after adjusting for inflation, the fastest pace since 2012 and a strong bounceback from the 5.3% decline in 2020. 

     Spending for software and information-processing equipment such as computers rose 14% in 2021 from the previous year. Since the first quarter of 2020, when Covid-19 began spreading rapidly in the U.S., those categories have grown vastly more than others, such as buildings, for which there is less need as work is increasingly done remotely. 

     Business spending will likely stay strong this year. Manufacturing firms surveyed by the Institute for Supply Management plan to raise capital expenditures by 7.7% in nominal terms in 2022. Service firms expect a 10.3% increase. 

     The new investment has contributed to an uptick in productivity by making workers more efficient. Productivity, which measures workers' output per hour worked, grew an average 2.2% a year in 2020 and 2021, up from a 0.9% average between 2011 and 2019, before the pandemic. 

     A more productive economy can produce more goods and services with the same number of hours worked. Over time that could raise workers' wages without pushing up inflation. 

     Robert Rosener, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said the uptick in capital spending ""is one area that stands out as a significant bright spot for economic growth in the longer term."" 

     In particular, new technology spending could occur in nontech sectors, such as retail trade, spreading productivity gains more widely, he said. About three-quarters of retail executives surveyed by Morgan Stanley last year said they intend to increase spending on information technology, up from 21% in 2019. 

     One driver of the push toward technology is a labor shortage that has executives struggling to recruit and retain employees. In December 2021 the U.S. labor force was about 1.4% smaller than in February 2020, before the pandemic became widespread in the U.S. Economic output, on the other hand, was 4.5% higher in the fourth quarter of last year than in the first quarter of 2020, after adjusting for inflation. 

     Brian Niccol, chief executive at burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., told investors in a February earnings call that the company has been struggling to recruit and is looking at automating some more tedious tasks. 

     ""How do we get rid of the jobs people frankly don't love doing?"" he said. ""If there was a way to cut and core the avocados so that all our team member has to do is mash and add the salt, add the lime, add the onions, that would make their job so much better."" 

     Walmart Inc., the country's largest employer, announced last year it would bring robots to 25 of its 42 regional distribution centers at a time when retailers nationwide have had trouble staffing warehouses. The company separately said last year it was looking to hire 20,000 permanent workers for its supply-chain operations and has boosted pay and bonuses. 

     Another driver is the move to remote work for legions of white-collar workers whose offices were shut down at the height of the pandemic. Firms have invested in online tools and software to allow their employees to work from home. 

     DocuSign Inc., which makes e-signature software saw a ""dramatic acceleration of purchases"" early in the pandemic, said CEO Daniel Springer, in a March 10 earnings call. The company's revenue grew 45% in its latest fiscal year, he said. 

     ""As the pandemic subsides and people begin to return to the office, they are not returning to paper,"" he said. ""E-signature is here to stay."" 

     Research by Jose Maria Barrero of the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago has found that many workers will continue working from home once the pandemic is over. About 20% of workdays will be at home post-pandemic versus 5% before the pandemic, they estimate. 

     That will boost productivity by about 1% using the Labor Department's measure, they estimate. At-home workers are more productive, they found, in part because they are spared office distractions. 

     Still, it is hard to predict how the rise in capital expenditures and remote work will affect productivity in the long run. Even in normal times, productivity is difficult to capture accurately. Pandemic-related disruptions, such as mass layoffs and rapid hiring in a relatively short amount of time, might have muddied the statistics further. 

     ""My best guess is it's probably a small positive,"" said Mr. Bloom. 

     Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, sees reasons to be both optimistic and pessimistic about future productivity growth. On the one hand, the increase in business spending suggests ""more automation and productivity-enhancing replacement of workers by machines,"" he said in an email. 

     On the other, Mr. Gordon's research suggests that much of the recent rise in productivity comes from industries such as finance or professional services, where a significant number of employees have been working remotely. 

     ""To the extent that this shift from office to at-home work is temporary, so is the productivity-growth revival,"" he said.

434,"European Currencies Hit Multiyear Lows As Energy Concerns Prompt Flight to Dollar

  By Caitlin Ostroff 

 

  European currencies fell against the dollar Monday as investors worried that a potential crackdown on Russian energy imports by the U.S. and its allies would hurt economic growth in the region. 

  The euro fell 0.6% to $1.0866, its lowest level since May 2020, according to FactSet. Investors have broadly sold European assets since the onset of Russia's war against Ukraine, worried that potential disruptions to energy supplies, a growing number of refugees to some countries and impacts on other commodities could weigh on growth. The British pound declined 0.5% against the dollar to its lowest level since November 2020. 

  Currencies of eastern European nations nearest Ukraine have been the most heavily sold against the dollar. The Polish zloty declined 2.2% Monday to its lowest level in more than 20 years, and the Hungarian forint declined almost 4%. Both the zloty and the forint have also fallen sharply against the euro. 

  Poland's central bank said last week that it is ready to tap its foreign-currency reserves (https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/russia-ukraine-latest-news-2022-03-01/card/polish-central-bank-prepares-to-defend-currency-after-selloff-luHOoWrM9ENanQqsTtu3) to stem the depreciation of the zloty. Central banks keep swaths of other currencies on hand in part as a resource to sell into the market, buying back their own currency, to bolster its value in times of drastic declines. Steep falls in a currency drive up the cost of imports denominated in euros or dollars, boosting inflation.

435,"Job Openings Hover Near Record Highs -- WSJ

By Bryan Mena 

     The number of job openings continued to dwarf the number of people looking for employment last month, according to private-sector estimates. 

     Employers had 11.2 million job openings on March 18, according to estimates from jobs site Indeed. That is a slight decline from the number the government reported in January but remains a historically high figure. 

     Strong demand for workers is a key factor pushing up wages and inflation in the current U.S. labor market, despite economic uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

     The Labor Department is set to release estimates on Tuesday at 10 a.m. of February job openings and the number of people who left their positions voluntarily. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the figures inched lower last month. The government data lag behind private-sector data by about a month. 

     Job openings soared in 2021 to a record 11.4 million in December, according to the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the number of times workers quit their jobs also soared, reaching a peak toward the end of last year. 

     The gap between the level of openings and the number of people who are unemployed and actively seeking work has persisted for several months. 

     ""Demand for labor is still incredibly high, but there's also progress happening, and we are on track to getting back to a pre-pandemic labor market based on many metrics by this year, potentially,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed. 

     Mr. Bunker said that the tightness in the labor market has already reduced in some sectors of the economy such as leisure and hospitality. He said this can be seen through quits trending down and wage growth cooling. 

     The average hourly pay for private-sector workers rose by just a penny in February, after growing by at least a dime a month over the last several months, and quits have been declining since peaking in November. 

     Hiring might get easier this year as more people seek jobs, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. 

     ""A lot of government support that was helping people out is over -- the government cheese isn't coming anymore. They'll need to work in order to support themselves,"" Mr. Shapiro said. ""And kids are back in school, so parents don't have to worry about what to do with their kids."" 

     The U.S. labor market still faces the challenge of elevated inflation, which rose 7.9% year-over-year in February, the highest in 40 years. 

     ""Everybody's reading about a high rate of inflation. They are seeing it at the gas pump, they are seeing it in the grocery stores, so that can cause employee demand for higher wage increases to kick up,"" said Patricia Buckley, managing director for economics at professional-services company Deloitte. 

     While consumers' expectations for inflation can affect wages, higher inflation can also lower demand for certain goods and services -- potentially also reducing some employers' demand for workers, Ms. Buckley said. 

     Because of higher costs, Michelle Pusateri, owner of Nana Joes Granola, a granola company in San Francisco, said she has tried to find ways to meet consumer demand without having to add more workers as she looks to minimize costs. 

     ""We have been looking at increasing efficiencies through automation, which would mean not having to hire more people,"" Ms. Pusateri said, citing the packaging process as one area of focus.

436,"New Hope Swings to 1H Profit, Pays Special Dividend on Strong Coal Prices

 
   By Rhiannon Hoyle 
 

  Australian coal miner New Hope Corp. said it returned to first-half profit and declared a special dividend after benefiting from a jump in commodity prices. 

  The company reported a net profit of 330.4 million Australian dollars (US$244 million) for the six months through January. It recorded a loss of A$55.4 million in the same period a year earlier. 

  Directors declared an interim dividend of 17 Australian cents a share, as well as a special dividend of 13 Australian cents. Both dividends are fully franked. That reflected its ""significant cash build, the near-term price outlook and the company's generous franking credit balance,"" New Hope said. 

  Revenue more than doubled on the year-earlier period, New Hope said, enabling it to fully repay debt from operational cash flow. 

  The miner reported an increase in average realized prices to A$192.38 a metric ton from A$77.98 a ton a year earlier. Prices rose over the half, to a closing realized price of A$236.66 a ton, New Hope said. 

  The miner said it also benefited from cost-control measures it had been implemented in response to earlier weakness in prices. 

  New Hope said it expects demand for high-quality, lower-emission thermal coal to remain strong in the short to medium term because supply is constrained. 

  ""This ongoing shortage is expected to keep prices at levels not previously experienced,"" said New Hope. ""Coupled with disciplined cost control, ensuring operating costs remain in the lowest cost quartile in comparison to other seaborne thermal coal producers, the company will continue to generate exceptional shareholder returns.""

437,"Fed&apos;s Daly Calls for &apos;Expeditious&apos; Rate Increases to End Year at Neutral Levels -- Update

  By Michael S. Derby 

 

     Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said Wednesday that the U.S. central bank should move up its short-term target rate quickly to neutral levels and that she supports a big interest rate increase at the start of next month. 

     ""I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path,"" with a rate that neither stimulates nor restrains the economy standing at around 2.5%, Ms. Daly said in a speech text. ""We will continue to evaluate the data and the risks, but today I see little indication that the economy needs policy accommodation."" 

     In terms of how much the Fed should move at next month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Ms. Daly told reporters after her remarks that ""my own starting point is that the case for a 50 basis point adjustment is now complete. In my judgment, the economy is resilient, it can handle these adjustments."" 

     Ms. Daly isn't a voting member of the rate setting FOMC this year. It next meets on May 3 and 4 in a gathering that many officials have hinted will result in a half percentage point increase in the federal-funds rate target range, now at 0.25% to 0.5%. 

     More increases are expected over the course of the year, and some could also be half percentage point increases as the Fed confronts the highest levels of inflation in 40 years. 

     When it comes to tackling inflation with monetary policy, ""we still have significant work to do. Moving purposefully to a more neutral stance that does not stimulate the economy is the top priority,"" Ms. Daly said. 

     Ms. Daly told reporters there are challenges to knowing where the neutral rate is in real time. She also said that while she sees a robust pace of rate rises coming, markets have gone a long way toward pricing that, and rate increases, coupled with looming cuts in the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet, are unlikely to shock the economy. 

     After the Fed reaches a neutral stance for monetary policy, Ms. Daly said officials can then take stock if they need to go further. Ms. Daly said the U.S. economy is in good shape and she doesn't expect Fed actions to cause a recession, although she acknowledged there is much uncertainty given the continuing pandemic and Russia's war on Ukraine. 

     ""There are, of course, no guarantees when it comes to a highly uncertain and fast-moving economy,"" Ms. Daly said, ""but for now, most economic agents also expect a smooth transition.""

438,"Global Growth Begins to Lose Steam -- WSJ

By Tom Fairless and Gabriel T. Rubin 

     FRANKFURT -- Economic growth is slowing in large parts of the globe as businesses struggle to navigate the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pandemic-prompted lockdowns in China and high inflation. 

     Surveys of purchasing managers conducted over recent weeks indicate a loss of steam in major economies such as Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. in April. 

     While service businesses are benefiting as Covid-19 restrictions are removed and households spend some of the savings they amassed during the pandemic, manufacturing firms in many places are wrestling with higher costs and supply-chain disruptions, according to surveys by S&P Global released Friday. Around the world, businesses worry that the surge in living costs is dampening people's willingness to spend. 

     The war in Ukraine suddenly boosted prices and dampened demand in many countries, disrupting a generally strong global economy rebound from the shock of the pandemic. The recovery, bolstered by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, has driven down unemployment in advanced economies while adding to pressure on global supply chains strained by intermittent Covid-19 outbreaks. All that has pushed inflation to the highest levels in several decades on both sides of the Atlantic. 

     In Germany, Europe's largest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse, the pace of growth in business activity slowed to a three-month low in April. S&P Global said its composite purchasing managers index for Germany slid to 54.5 from 55.1 in March. A reading above 50 indicates growth, while a level below 50 signals contraction. 

     The first fall in German manufacturing output since June 2020 was offset by a pickup of service-sector growth to the fastest pace since August. The autos sector was particularly hard hit, recording a steepening and marked loss of output, the surveys found. 

     Germany's Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said that its global sales declined by about 6% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier. BMW blamed ""the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the Covid lockdowns in China."" 

     Rolf Breidenbach, chief executive of German auto supplier Hella GmbH Co. KGaA, said in an April 7 earnings statement, ""There are still massive supply shortages for certain electronic components and materials and the development of the coronavirus pandemic also continues to give rise to significant risks, especially in the Chinese market."" 

     ""It can be assumed that the rise in prices, especially for raw and other materials, energy and logistics, will be ongoing,"" he added. 

     Germany's Bundesbank warned Friday that an embargo on Russian energy imports would reduce the nation's economic output by about 5% this year, triggering a recession and a further rise in inflation. European officials are currently discussing plans to phase out Russian oil imports. Germany buys more than half its natural-gas imports from Russia. 

     U.S. firms reported that business activity rose in April, but at a slower pace than in March, in part because higher inflation curbed the growth in spending on services, the S&P Global survey said. The composite purchasing managers index for the U.S. economy was 55.1, down from 57.7 in March and the lowest in three months. 

     ""Many businesses continue to report a tailwind of pent up demand from the pandemic, but companies are also facing mounting challenges from rising inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as persistent supply chain delays and labor constraints,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. 

     The PMI for U.S. services providers fell to 54.7 so far in April, from 58 in March and the lowest in three months. Manufacturers reported an upswing in April activity, with the PMI coming in at 59.7, the highest in seven months and up from 58.8 in February. 

     In the U.S., services providers raised their prices at the fastest rate on record, according to S&P Global, as firms passed on higher costs to customers. Manufacturers reported they are expanding their workforce numbers at the fastest rate since July 2021 as they try to relieve a backlog of orders. 

     The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday reduced its forecast for global economic growth this year by nearly a percentage point to 3.6%, down from 6.1% last year, warning that the war in Ukraine was adding to the economic strains wrought by the pandemic. The institution warned that recent lockdowns in key manufacturing and trade hubs in China would likely compound supply disruptions elsewhere. 

     China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 is battering consumer spending and hurting industrial production in an economy grappling with a real estate crunch and a regulatory crackdown on industries including technology and education. 

     ""What we see in China is that consumption is falling short; it is not recovering as strongly as necessary,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Wednesday. 

     In the U.K., the S&P Global surveys pointed to a marked cooling in the pace of economic growth in April. The composite PMI for the U.K. declined to 57.6 from 60.9 in March, reaching a three-month low. Businesses said rising living costs and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine had impacted client demand. Business optimism declined to the lowest since October 2020. 

     ""Firms are taking a more cautious approach to hiring and spending as demand cools and the outlook becomes gloomier, to suggest that the slowdown in the economy has further to run,"" Mr. Williamson said. 

     U.K. retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in March, according to official data published Friday, while consumer confidence sank to the second-lowest on record in April. 

     ""The U.K. is teetering on the edge of a recession and that's before inflation hits 8% or higher later this year,"" said Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International. 

     The surveys indicated an acceleration in growth overall in the 19-nation eurozone, whose composite PMI rose to 55.8 in April from 54.9 in March. Business activity among service providers rose at the fastest rate since August, led by a boom in tourism and recreation activity. The pickup could encourage the European Central Bank to move ahead with aggressive interest-rate increases aimed at containing skyrocketing inflation, economists said. ECB officials have signaled that they could start to increase rates as soon as July. 

     Such moves add to headwinds that are ricocheting through global financial markets and weighing on asset prices. Borrowing costs are already rising sharply around the world as investors anticipate more rate rises from the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. 

     One bright spot in Europe is France, where growth picked up in recent weeks to the strongest level since January 2018, as a modest uptick in factory output was accompanied by the largest surge in services activity since the start of that year, S&P Global said. France's economy is less reliant than Germany's on manufacturing and on Russian energy. 

     Despite the record drop in inflation-adjusted wages, ""consumers still seem eager to spend some of their savings built up during the lockdowns now that restrictions have eased,"" said Bert Colijn, an economist with ING Bank.

439,"The NBA Went Smaller. The Biggest Players Got Better. -- WSJ

  By Ben Cohen 

 

     The best players in the NBA this season were three very large men from three different countries, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and even they might admit the best player in the world as the playoffs begin this weekend is Kevin Durant. 

     But there is something odd about the game's biggest stars: Their games are nothing alike. 

     They happen to be about the same height, but at no other time in the history of the NBA have 7-footers been so remarkably dissimilar. They don't look like each other. They don't work like each other, either. They certainly don't behave on the court like any of the hulking behemoths who came before them. 

     Even the stories of how they got to the league have little in common. Durant was the greatest American player of his era. Embiid was a volleyball player in Cameroon. Jokic was a pudgy kid in Serbia. Antetokounmpo was a scrawny teen in Greece. 

     But together these four players standing about 28 feet tall have cast a long shadow over the league. They are still the most dominant forces in a sport where simply being larger than everyone is no longer enough to dominate. 

     At a time when the big man risked becoming an endangered species, Jokic, Embiid, Durant and Antetokounmpo are making Darwin proud as living proof of basketball adaptation. 

     ""I believe in evolution,"" says NBA legend Bill Walton. ""These really incredible players who have capitalized and used and leveraged every possible advantage that today's athletes have in terms of training and conditioning and nutrition and science and medicine and equipment and court surface and ball quality and the technology. Everything that goes into making today better than yesterday. I believe in all this stuff."" 

     It would be difficult to watch the NBA and believe otherwise. 

     The first thing anyone sees when they look at these players is their size, but the most striking part about today's big men is their collection of skills. The mobility, nimbleness and versatility they flaunt on a nightly basis is nothing less than mind-boggling to the few people on the planet who see eye-to-eye with them. 

     ""I come from an era where that was unheard of,"" said Alaa Abdelnaby, an NBA player in the 1990s who now has a front-row seat to Embiid's theatrics as a Philadelphia 76ers broadcaster. ""That package was beyond anyone's comprehension when I was in the league."" 

     Even basketball stats these days are subject to inflation, but their numbers this season were staggering. Jokic registered the highest player-efficiency rating of all time, surpassing the mark previously set by Antetokounmpo, who also broke his own record. Embiid, meanwhile, became the first center since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 to win the scoring title. 

     Which one of these international stars deserves the MVP award is the battleground of NBA podcasts, but far more interesting than the marginal discrepancies in their statistical cases are the massive differences in the way they do their jobs. 

     Their ancestors might lament big men today, but the game has never demanded more from their breed. They have to cover more ground. They have to guard more positions. Like so many jobs in the modern economy, they have to do more of just about everything. 

     ""There's nobody in my group who's going to like this style of basketball, "" says Bill Cartwright, the 7-foot-1 center who won three championships with Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. ""But it is what it is right now. And it's going to keep evolving into something else later."" 

     Embiid is the closest approximation to a traditional big man, but there is nothing traditional about anyone his size who is graceful handling the ball, comfortable behind the 3-point arc and productive at the free-throw line. The only 7-footers ever to average more foul shots than Embiid this season were Wilt Chamberlain and O'Neal, but Chamberlain's career-high at the line was 61% and O'Neal made 51% in the year he took the most foul shots. Embiid is an 81% shooter. 

     There's someone else a few thousand miles away doing things nobody has seen before. Jokic led the Nuggets in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks while functioning as Denver's center, point guard and basically every position in between. The whole team would fall apart without him. In fact, it does. The Nuggets won Jokic's minutes by 8.4 points per 100 possessions and managed to lose the minutes he was on the bench by 7.9 points. That gap in net rating was easily the widest margin in the league. 

     Jokic and Embiid will likely finish atop MVP ballots for the second year in a row, and most NBA general managers would still prefer to have Antetokounmpo attacking the hoop or Durant doing anything he wants in the playoffs, but they can't go wrong with any of them. What makes them so dangerous is they don't just score over people. They also create ways to score around them. They can beat you vertically and horizontally. 

     ""They're basketball players who happen to be big,"" Walton says, ""as opposed to big guys who are trying to play basketball."" 

     How to stop these seemingly unstoppable talents is a question that will help determine the playoffs this spring and contract negotiations this summer. Some big men will have to play smaller to stay on the court. Other teams will ask smaller guys to play bigger. Their performance will be one of the driving factors behind deal talks and the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in salary as soon as the season is over. 

     But the great irony of big men reasserting their supremacy is that the 3-point line was designed to blunt their genetic advantages. 

     The NBA was looking for ways to electrify the game and diversify its talent pool when it dropped a strip of paint on the court that would change basketball forever. Before the existence of this arc, it didn't make sense for them to drift from the paint, the most efficient part of the court. Now they had a powerful mathematical incentive. In every season between 1965 and 1980, the MVP of the league was a center. But in the four decades since the line was introduced, especially the last one, the game shifted away from the basket and out of their control. 

     This could have been an event of mass extinction for the giants roaming the basketball earth unless they adapted in order to survive. The players who were already in the NBA when the 3-point line joined them wouldn't get that opportunity. Even the ones in college and high school would struggle to adjust to a game that fundamentally changed overnight. It would take a generation or two for big men to have the freedom to be anyone they wanted. 

     ""For guys of my era, I always think: What would it have been like if you grew up and were told you could do everything?"" says former NBA center Chris Dudley. 

     One of the bizarre things about the way basketball talent is recognized, developed and rewarded is that despite all the money, resources and data poured into valuations, even the brightest minds can get the best players wrong. It's a humbling business that requires making predictions based on projecting how teenagers might behave a decade later. The market that exists to identify future talent is deeply inefficient almost by definition. 

     But it's especially tricky to figure out how any big man might fit into today's NBA because their job requirements keep shifting. 

     They are no longer confined by their position. They're redefining it. 

     ""These guys don't live under those restrictions or limitations,"" Walton said. ""One of the endlessly beautiful things about basketball is that it's an extension of the creativity and imagination that comes from a fertile mind. We are witnessing that right now in the way these guys play.""

440,"Battle for Materials Slows Drillers -- WSJ

  A scarcity of equipment, raw materials, workers and investment capital is raising costs and causing delays for some producers in the Permian Basin 

By Collin Eaton 

     MIDLAND, Texas -- America's most prolific oil field is running out of the workers, cash and equipment needed to produce more oil. 

     In the Permian Basin, the sprawling oil-rich region in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, drillers are facing long delays and steep competition for everything from roughnecks to steel to fracking pumps. 

     The region is the only place where U.S. crude production is expected to grow significantly this year, and the Biden administration is hoping production there can help alleviate high prices at the pump. But mounting supply-chain crunches are putting a ceiling on how much more frackers can produce there, said energy executives and analysts, despite the highest oil prices in roughly seven years. 

     Unlike the last time oil fetched about $100 a barrel, the vast service industry of steel suppliers, drilling-rig operators and fracking companies that develop shale producers' wells is coming into the current price cycle malnourished. Service companies mothballed large fleets of equipment during the pandemic and investors remain wary of the industry, leaving companies short of capital and reluctant to invest in new fracking fleets and drilling rigs. 

     U.S. drillers are expected to raise domestic oil output by about 8% from last year to about 12.6 million barrels a day by December, according to the Energy Information Administration, and analysts say most of that growth will come from the Permian. By contrast, in 2014, the last time oil prices topped $100 a barrel, U.S. production grew by 1.6 million barrels a day, nearly 20% over the year, according to the EIA. 

     Several factors are holding back production, including publicly listed producers' decision to return more cash to investors and limit spending on growth as well as the rapid depletion of some of the best shale wells. Now, supply-chain snarls mean that shale companies that want to grow production will be hard-pressed to do so. 

     The bottlenecks have forced some shale producers to pause operations for days, weeks or even months while they wait for steel casing, for which there is currently far less inventory than usual in the Permian, or to replace workers, many of whom haven't returned to the industry since the pandemic. In some cases, entire crews have left projects before completion in search of bigger paychecks, executives said. 

     ""If somebody walked in and put a pile of money on the table and said, 'Drill me a well next week,' it isn't going to happen,"" said Jamie Small, president of private-equity-backed oil producer Element Petroleum III. ""You just can't get the stuff to do it."" 

     It took Element a month to replace a crew that walked away from a job fracking several of the company's wells, in favor of a higher-paying gig, Mr. Small said. Most of the fracking companies Element tried to hire asked it to source its own sand, a key ingredient used to prop open fissures in fossil fuel-bearing rocks, which was too expensive to do. It eventually hired two smaller entrants to begin work next month, he said. 

     Mr. Small said his company is looking to drill 10 to 12 wells this year, but even with high oil prices, it would be difficult to find the resources to increase that to 15 or 18 wells. 

     Steve Burleson, president of Burleson Petroleum, said he may have to wait at least nine months for an underground electric cable for parts of his oil-field operations, after a plant that makes the equipment shut down. Meanwhile, he said his other option is to incur an additional $35,000 per month energy bill to run a generator that will have to consume 500 gallons of diesel a day. 

     Mr. Burleson said he is concerned the supply-chain problems will raise costs beyond his estimated $11 million budget for a new well he is planning to drill next month. It is already 35% more expensive than the last well his company drilled in December, he said. 

     In the past three years, capital spending by the oil-field services sector has fallen roughly 70% compared with the three-year period 2017-2019, said Ann Fox, chief executive officer of Nine Energy Service. Deep budget cuts during the pandemic meant companies predominantly spent money on maintaining existing equipment rather than building new tools, she said. That left the Permian short on fracking equipment and drilling rigs. 

     Executives said daily rates for drilling rigs have run as high as $30,000, almost double the cost of last year's prices. Walking through a Permian rig yard last week, Kurt Bailey, operations manager at rig company Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., said his company has virtually all of its locally available 56 top-end drilling rigs deployed in different parts of the Permian, and has just a handful of older models sitting idle. 

     Likewise, the price of steel pipe used in drilling and bringing oil wells online has climbed substantially in the past few months. Steel distributors in the Permian have little inventory, typically sending their steel pipe to oil companies soon after it reaches their yards, executives said. 

     Diamondback Energy Inc., one of the largest Permian oil producers, has seen costs for steel casing shoot up, with U.S. steel prices up nearly 40% since the end of 2020. Diamondback plans to keep oil production roughly flat this year, but if it tried to increase production, it would have to steer equipment away from smaller rivals by paying higher prices, Chief Operating Officer Daniel Wesson said. 

     The dynamic creates a zero-sum game in the Permian, where one producer's decision to grow comes at the expense of a competitor and would be unlikely to lift the Permian's net output, Mr. Wesson said. 

     ""If we were going to change to growth mode right now, anything we'd do would be inflationary,"" he said. 

     American shale companies have deployed some 250 fracking fleets into the nation's oil patches, with only about 15 to 25 more available on the sidelines, said Robert Drummond, CEO of NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc., a large fracking company. 

     Mr. Drummond said his company believes that until companies build more fracking equipment, U.S. oil-production growth will top out at less than 1 million barrels a day annually. 

     The shortfalls could persist into 2023 if oil-field service companies continue to keep capital investments low and relegate spending to maintaining, rather than building, equipment, according to executives in the industry, including at Halliburton Co., the largest U.S. service company. 

     ""When you look at the capital that's available to oil-field services, it's not enough to make a meaningful difference,"" in the oil-field-supply chain, said Casey Maxwell, vice president of the Permian Basin for Halliburton.

441,"Companies May Speed Up Refinancing Plans as Higher Rates Loom -- WSJ

By Nina Trentmann 

     Companies looking to tap the debt markets will likely accelerate those plans after Federal Reserve minutes revealed that half-percentage point rises in interest rates might be in the offing to curb inflation. 

     Interest rates remain low, even after the Fed's quarter-point rate rise last month. But the hawkish outlook at the U.S. central bank may be sharpening financing plans at major corporations. 

     ""A lot of the supply in the second quarter will be companies that say, with the Fed signaling higher rates, it's better to get capital now,"" said James Shepard, head of the investment-grade-debt capital-markets business at Mizuho Americas. 

     Released Wednesday, minutes of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee showed members considered raising rates by 50 basis points at their March 15-16 meeting. 

     ""Many participants noted that one or more [half-percentage-point] increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified,"" the minutes said. 

     Instead, U.S. central bank officials agreed to a more modest rise in the benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5%. They also penciled in a series of increases for later this year, moving rates closer to 2%. 

     In the current quarter, $242.65 billion in U.S. corporate debt will be coming due, followed by $199.64 billion in the next and $197.26 billion in the fourth, according to data provider Dealogic. 

     Some businesses could opt to just pay down their debt, but many are expected to refinance, corporate bankers said. 

     According to Dealogic, AT&T Inc., AbbVie Inc., Ford Motor Co. and Phillips 66 are among businesses with more than $1 billion in debt maturing in the second quarter -- in AT&T's case, more than $20 billion. 

     All four companies declined to comment. But bankers think the current market's appeal will be fading over time. 

     ""There is still that mentality of taking advantage of healthy market conditions and locking in rates with the concern that we might see rates continue to rise from here,"" said Dan Mead, head of the investment grade syndicate at Bank of America Corp. 

     ""Even with the increase in interest rates, financing costs are still attractive,"" noted Marc Fratepietro, global co-head of the investment-grade debt capital markets business at Deutsche Bank AG. 

     After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, finance executives suddenly found themselves plying choppier markets. But the turmoil seemed to have little effect on bond sales. According to data provider Refinitiv, companies sold $458.06 billion in U.S. investment grade-rated corporate bonds in the first quarter, roughly in line with the prior-year period. 

     Some companies are locking in interest rates as they prepare to hedge coming maturities. 

     Johnson Controls International PLC, a building products and energy services company, has just under $1 billion in debt coming due in the next 12 months. The company is hedging rates for most of the debt it plans to refinance, Finance Chief Olivier Leonetti said. 

     Many businesses in recent months took advantage of still-low rates to bring down their financing costs. Boston Scientific Corp., a maker of medical devices, in March priced $3 billion in senior notes in Europe and tendered a similar amount, $2.85 billion, in the U.S. 

     The transaction was meant to diversify the company's debt portfolio, adding more debt in Europe to better balance its exposure to the U.S., CFO Dan Brennan said. ""We were able to bring down our overall debt cost by 80 basis points,"" he said. 

     Businesses planning to issue debt over the coming weeks will have to be flexible on timing, bankers said. 

     ""It's a combination of thoughtful consideration and luck,"" said Aaron Alt, chief financial officer at Sysco Corp., referring to finding the right moment to go to market. The Houston-based food-service company refinanced $1.25 billion in debt late last year and plans to pay down about $450 million in debt this year. 

     ""We are constantly assessing opportunities that the banks are bringing to us,"" Mr. Alt added, speaking of the company's liability management. 

     The FOMC next meets in early May.

442,"Dow Falls for Fourth Straight Day -- WSJ

  By Justin Baer,Will Horner and Dave Sebastian 

 

     U.S. stocks swung between gains and losses on Tuesday as uncertainty over inflation, interest rates and the economy continued to weigh on the market. 

     All three major indexes opened higher, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite up 2.8% at one point. By late morning, stocks had mostly erased those gains and appeared on track to extend a brutal three-day slide. But as the afternoon wore on, investors turned their attention to Wednesday's report on consumer prices and the possibility that inflation may be peaking -- and stocks rebounded again. 

     The S&P 500 closed up 9.81 points, 0.2%, at 4001.05, a day after the broad index slumped 3.2% to its lowest level for the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 114.42 points, or 1%, to 11737.67. 

     ""The market was taking too negative of a read on the consumer-price index, leading to the afternoon recovery,"" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. 

     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight trading session, hitting a 52-week low. It closed down 84.96 points, or 0.3%, at 32160.74. 

     A cocktail of geopolitical risks and economic headwinds is posing the biggest threat to global growth in years and rattling markets. In the U.S., soaring inflation has prompted the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates and investors fear the move could tip the economy into recession. 

     Global markets are looking equally troubled. In China, resurgent Covid-19 outbreaks and Beijing's strict approach to fighting them threaten to revive the supply chain bottlenecks that first drove inflation higher. In Europe, the war in Ukraine threatens to keep energy prices elevated and is weighing on the region's growth. 

     ""People came in this morning expecting a relief rally after being hammered the last few days,"" said Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. ""But with inflation in the U.S., the Covid challenges in China and the war in Ukraine, rarely have we seen three major market-moving catalysts converge."" 

     Early Tuesday, some investors snapped up shares that had been battered by those headwinds. 

     ""Everyone at this point is looking to see if we've bottomed,"" said Quincy Krosby, Chief Equity Strategist for LPL Financial. ""The instincts are that we haven't bottomed yet."" 

     Wednesday's report on fresh consumer-price index data is expected to show inflation rose at a slower pace in April than the previous month, Ms. Krosby said. 

     Investor sentiment can turn on a dime, she added. In January 2019, a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank would be patient with rate increases -- reversing a steep market selloff. 

     The market has entered a new era, Mr. Quinlan said, and investors are more inclined to wait for solid evidence that those challenges have subsided before betting the stocks have reached a bottom. 

     ""Investors are very skeptical now,"" he said. ""They want to see the data. They don't want to listen to policy makers. Any improvements build the scaffolding for the bottom. But we're not there yet."" 

     Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Tuesday that he believes the Fed can achieve a ""softish landing"" for the U.S. economy while raising rates, though the unemployment rate could rise. 

     ""By 2023 you are very likely to see growth slowing very significantly, and the specter of recessions is really starting to loom,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""What we are seeing is the realization that it is going to be very tough for the Fed to get that soft landing just right."" 

     Investors on Tuesday were welcoming signs that the conflict in Ukraine wasn't escalating and a planned EU embargo on Russian oil could face delays, Ms. Shah said. 

     Peloton Interactive fell $1.23, or 8.7%, to $12.90 after reporting declining sales and mounting losses as the stationary-bike maker struggles with the return to prepandemic consumer habits. 

     Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. surged by $56.86, or 68%, to $140 after Pfizer said it would buy the rest of the company for around $11.6 billion. 

     Duke Realty rose $1.87, or 3.9%, to $49.58 after Prologis said it had made an offer to buy the real-estate investment trust for about $23.7 billion. Prologis fell $6.96, or 5.3%, to $125.41. 

     The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.990% from 3.080% on Monday. 

     Brent crude oil fell $3.48, or 3.3%, to $102.46 a barrel. Oil prices had been rising for the past few months, but concerns that China's lockdowns will sap demand for commodities have taken some steam off the rally. 

     Demand for oil in China is likely to rebound sharply when restrictions start to ease, though the European Union's proposed ban on imports of Russian oil remains an overhang, said Daniel Hynes, a senior commodity strategist at ANZ in Sydney. 

     ""The fundamentals are still very tilted toward an extremely tight market with certainly risks skewed to further declines in supply over the next three to six months,"" Mr. Hynes said. 

     Bitcoin prices edged lower after a steep selloff. The world's largest cryptocurrency on Tuesday traded at $30,959.99 as of 5 p.m. ET, down 0.4% from $31,075.70 at the same time a day earlier. 

     Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.6% lower, the Shanghai Composite rose 1.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 1.8%.

443,"EUROPEAN MIDDAY BRIEFING - Shares Waver on Powell&apos;s Hawkish Pivot

  MARKET WRAPS 

  Stocks: 

  European equities mostly drifted lower Wednesday as investors continued to weigh the Federal Reserve's commitment to fight inflation after the latest hawkish comments from Jerome Powell. 

  Mining shares retreated on weaker base metals while the oil sector gained as crude futures rose. 

  On the economic front, U.K. annual inflation reached a four-decade high of 9% in April as higher energy prices fed through households' utility bills, exacerbating a cost-of-living crisis that is squeezing consumers' real incomes. 

  The consumer price index--which measures what consumers pay for some goods and services--increased at its fastest pace since 1982, a sharp pickup from the 7% inflation rate registered in March.

  Economic Insight: 

  Citi's rates strategists expect the market to likely gravitate toward a 50% chance of a 50 basis point interest rate rise by the European Central Bank at the July monetary policy meeting. 

  They consider a 25bp rate hike in July ""as close to a 'done deal' as it can be,"" adding that there appears to be little opposition across the ECB's Governing Council to ending negative rates. The strategists expect the ""hawks"" to become worried about recession closing the window for raising rates. 

  U.S. Markets: 

  Stock futures traded modestly lower on Powell's hawkish pivot. 

  Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that while Powell's sentiment was not ""necessarily new, his explicit comment that neutral rates are 'not a stopping point' garnered focus"" on Wall Street. 

  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.964% from 2.969% Tuesday. 

  Shares on the move premarket: 

  Lowe's was up slightly ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report. Home-improvement rival Home Depot finished with a gain of 1.7% Tuesday after earnings topped analysts' expectations and it raised guidance for 2022. 

  --- 

  Target gained 0.4%. It reports earnings Wednesday. Shares of the retailer fell 1.4% Tuesday after Walmart missed first-quarter earnings expectations and forecast a decline in full-year per-share earnings. 

  Forex: 

  The scope for the euro to rise against the dollar looks limited as the market's expectations for interest-rate rises from the ECB seem too aggressive, said ING. 

  Markets are pricing in too much tightening for the ECB but not for the Fed, while the U.S.-eurozone growth divergence will become more relevant into the summer, exacerbated by the EU-Russia standoff on commodities, said ING. 

  ""With this in mind, we suspect that any further rally in EUR/USD may start to lose steam around the 1.0650-1.0700 area, with risks of a return below 1.0500 in the near term being quite material."" 

  --- 

  Sterling fell after data showed U.K. inflation accelerated further in April, hitting 9%, and adding pressure on already strained household incomes. Economists polled by the WSJ expected inflation to reach 9.1%. 

  ""Inflation in the U.K. is completely out of control, and there is no doubt that soaring inflation is having a negative influence on disposable incomes,"" said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam. 

  The Bank of England is under pressure to do more to control inflation but it is walking a fine line and can only do so much, he said. 

  Bonds: 

  Eurozone government bonds steadied in early European trading following a selloff Tuesday triggered by a risk-on mood in global markets. 

  --- 

  Citi estimates the fair value of France's new 0.75% February 2028 government bond 8 basis points above the yield of the 0% February 2027 OAT. 

  The French Treasury Agency will launch the new bond as part of a EUR10 billion-EUR11.5 billion auction Thursday where it will also reopen the 0% February 2025 OAT and the 0% February 2026 OAT. Citi said they see relative value in the February 2025 and February 2026 OAT on the French bond curve. 

  --- 

  The green premium on Denmark's 0% November 2031 green bond, which will be reopened at auction on Wednesday, has narrowed to 1 basis point versus its conventional twin bond from around 5 bps at the launching auction in January, said Danske Bank. However, the green premium rarely goes below 1 bp and thus the 10-year Danish green bond looks cheap relative to EU peers such as Germany and the Netherlands. 

  The green premium, or ""greenium"", on the Danish green government bond is exactly measurable because the Danish debt management office issues green bonds in a twin-bond structure, first applied by Germany, with conventional and green bonds having identical maturity and coupons. 

  Energy: 

  Oil futures were more than 1% higher on easing Covid curbs in China and expectations for new sanctions on Russia, with DNB Markets forecasting prices will rise as high as $130 by the end of the year before easing to $115 next year. 

  A combination of increased demand as China eases its Covid-19 lockdowns and declining Russian oil production is likely to completely exhaust global capacity by the end of the year, said DNB Markets. 

  Macquarie said that while the near-term outlook for oil is strong, it expects prices to fade in the second half. 

  Brent crude has averaged $107 in the second quarter so far but a likely increase in supply from OPEC and other countries, potentially including Iran, should weigh on prices in the second half, Macquarie said. 

  ""We maintain our long-term assumption of $65 but defer this to the first quarter of 2024 [from 1Q of 2023],"" Macquarie said. 

  Metals: 

  Industrial metals weakened on gloomy signs for the global economy following Powell's comments Tuesday. And weak Chinese data in recent days caused by lockdowns have raised concerns about demand.

444,"Metal Prices Set to Rise Amid Energy Transition, World Bank Says

 

  By Yusuf Khan 

 

  Demand for metals involved in the energy transition is set to surge over the coming decades, which is likely to push prices much higher, according to a new report from the World Bank. 

  During the energy transition, demand for fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas is likely to remain flat or even decline, but metals and minerals demand is likely to rise amid the development of green energy resources like electric vehicles, renewable energy and other low carbon technologies, the report said. 

  ""Prices for these metals could remain elevated for a prolonged period. This will depend on the speed and direction of the energy transition, the volume of mining capital investment, environmental constraints on these industries, and policy measures and incentives,"" the bank said. 

  Both copper and aluminum were highlighted as key beneficiaries of the energy transition, with the red metal used in wind turbines, solar panels, grid connections, electric vehicles, and battery charging infrastructure, according to the bank. Meanwhile, aluminum is used in battery packaging, hydrogen fuel cells, and solar photovoltaics. 

  Other key metals will be steel alloys like chromium and iron ore, battery metals like nickel, lithium and cobalt as well as rare earth and platinum group metals. 

  One of the key risks the bank noted was that mineral availability can often be centralized to certain key regions within the world, something that isn't seen as much in other commodity sectors. 

  ""Global metal production and consumption are considerably more concentrated geographically than oil production. China, in particular, is the single largest consumer and producer of all refined base metals. It accounts for roughly 50 percent of global consumption of metals, while it consumes just 15 percent of global crude oil output."" 

  Meanwhile more than 70% of cobalt production, key for electric-vehicle batteries, is limited to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while more than 90% of chemical processing takes place in China, according to industry body the Cobalt Institute. 

  This could result in supply risks and price volatility, while also bringing windfall revenues for countries that host the minerals and their processing, the report said. 

  The bank also called for policy makers to ""provide a conducive policy environment that ensures sufficient investment goes into metals production to avoid future shortfalls."" This would involve ensuring projects can be expanded quickly if a resource is found while implementing subsidies, raising recycling rates and using carbon pricing. 

  The World Bank added that an organization similar to the International Energy Agency should be established, with a focus on metals and minerals to assist with data collection and analysis.

445,"Apple Boosting Pay Budget for Workers Amid Tight Labor Market -- Update

  By Tim Higgins 

 

     Apple Inc. is boosting pay for workers amid rising inflation, a tight labor market and unionization pushes among hourly store employees. 

     The iPhone maker on Wednesday told employees in an email that the company is increasing its overall compensation budget. Starting pay for hourly workers in the U.S. will rise to $22 an hour, or higher based upon the market, a 45% increase from 2018. Starting salaries in the U.S. are also expected to increase. 

     ""Supporting and retaining the best team members in the world enables us to deliver the best, most innovative, products and services for our customers,"" an Apple spokesman said in a statement. ""This year as part of our annual performance review process, we're increasing our overall compensation budget."" 

     Apple's plans are just the latest by companies fighting to keep talent. Microsoft Corp. told workers this month that the company would almost double its global budget for merit-based salary raises. 

     In recent months, Apple has been facing unusual labor unrest. That discontent has spanned from front-line store retail workers agitating for unionization to salaried engineers unhappy with the company's plans to return to the office. 

     Some workers, including those hourly employees in its stores and AppleCare, were told their annual reviews would be moved up three months and that their pay increases would take effect in early July, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The normal review process coincides with the end of Apple's fiscal year in the fall. 

     Those workers were told the company's increased compensation budget would be in addition to pay increases and special awards already received within the past year. 

     Facing a war for talent, tech companies have also seen their biggest compensation tools -- stock awards -- hindered by a downturn in company valuations. Apple shares have fallen 21% this year through Tuesday's close.

   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. 

  0934 GMT - The strength of the dollar, high commodities prices and U.S. interest rates are ""inextricably linked,"" says Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for core investments at AXA Investment Managers, in a note. Speculators are buying the dollar due to interest-rate differentials, which is unlikely to change until commodity prices reverse, signaling a peak in inflation, and/or when the Federal Reserve slows down interest-rate rises, he says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0922 GMT - Risk-on market sentiment could lead to a modest move tighter in euro corporate bonds, says UniCredit's research team. ""We expect only a cautious reversal of yesterday's spread widening, which largely reflected the decline in European government bond yields and took place across credit market segments,"" analysts at the Italian bank say. Spreads of riskier euro debt widened lately, ""confirming that investors are more concerned about credit risk than duration risk,"" they say. Duration risk refers to the risk of central banks raising interest rates, causing the value of bonds to fall. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

  0903 GMT - Risk premiums on euro corporate bonds should stabilize Friday, though the environment remains fragile, says UniCredit's research team. ""The absence of pivotal data releases and the positive opening in equity futures, together with stable Bund futures this morning, argues in favor of a stabilization in corporate credit risk premiums today,"" analysts at the Italian bank say in a note. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gains 1.2% and S&P 500 futures rise by 1%. (lorena.ruibal@wsj.com) 

  0850 GMT - The euro has recovered slightly overnight following steep losses on Thursday against the dollar but there is ""no sign of recovery"" as it continues to hover around $1.04, says Dorothea Huttanus, analyst at DZ Bank, in a note. On Thursday, the euro fell to a multi-year low of 1.0358, according to FactSet, and concerns about the European energy supply were likely to have spoiled the mood. This offset signals from the European Central Bank that leave little room for doubt about an interest rate rise in July, she says. EUR/USD trades at 1.0406%, up 0.2% on the day. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0832 GMT - The FTSE 100 index rises 1.4% to 7334.16, recovering after sharp losses on Thursday and a volatile week. ""Comments from [U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman] Jerome Powell to the effect that it might be difficult to avoid a 'hard landing' in the U.S. economy dented sentiment, but overall it looks like equities are still trying to build a base,"" IG analysts say in a note. Heavyweight mining and oil stocks rise as the price of a barrel of Brent crude gains 0.8% to $108.35. Coca-Cola HBC gains 3.5% after Jefferies upgraded the stock to buy from hold.

  0752 GMT - Malaysia's economic recovery should gain further momentum for the remainder of the year, after a better-than-expected 5.0% growth for 1Q GDP, says Capital Economics Asia economist Alex Holmes in a note. With a lower number of Covid-19 cases and the further easing of domestic restrictions, consumer spending is likely to rebound further in 2Q, and another tailwind will come from the reopening to international travel, he says. While the tourism recovery is still in its infancy, the reopening of borders has allowed companies to fill labor shortages and for day workers to resume crossing to Singapore to work in higher-paid jobs, he adds. The economist raises his 2022 GDP growth forecast to 8.5% from 6.5%. (chester.tay@wsj.com) 

  0747 GMT - Singapore's non-oil domestic exports likely rose 6.8% on year in April, according to the median estimate of six economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. In March, non-oil domestic exports rose 7.7% from a year earlier. NODX growth likely moderated in April despite a favorable base effect, as Covid-19 lockdowns in China may have disrupted external demand and supply chains, Barclays economists say in a research report. On a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis, non-oil domestic exports likely fell 4.1% in April, according to the median estimate of five economists, after the 2.3% on-month decline in March. The data are due on May 17. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com) 

  0739 GMT - The selloff in German Bunds may have run out of steam for now, Citi's rates strategist Jamie Searle says in a note. ""Markets are twitchy, but we are gaining confidence that the Bund selloff may have peaked for now, not least given the sharp correction lower in inflation forwards and with neutral rate pricing likely understating periphery risk,"" he says. He finds that Bunds no longer look that ""rich"" vs. inflation forwards on a simple long-term projection. The 10-year Bund yield is trading 1.5 bps higher at 0.896%, trading at significantly lower levels compared to last Friday's close at 1.150%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0736 GMT - The U.S. dollar edges lower, trimming some of its recent steep gains after the DXY dollar index hit a 19-year high of 104.9250 on Thursday, but any falls should be temporary, says Derek Halpenny, MUFG's head of research for Europe, Middle East and Africa. ""The U.S. dollar softness so far today looks more like a temporary respite with risks high that general financial market volatility will remain high,"" he says in a note. The euro could also be vulnerable, with focus on energy supply from Russia to Europe after a 12% rise in natural gas prices Thursday, Halpenny says. EUR/USD rises 0.2% to 1.0397, having hit a multi-year low of 1.0358 on Thursday. The DXY falls 0.2% to 104.62. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com) 

  0728 GMT - SGD strengthens slightly against USD in the afternoon Asian session amid a risk-on mood. With Asian markets having opened with a calmer tone this morning, there's some chance for risk appetite in Asia ex-Japan currencies to improve slightly, say Maybank analysts in a research report. While USD/SGD's momentum on the daily technical chart is mildly bullish, its relative strength index is in overbought territory, says Maybank, pegging initial support at 1.3800 and initial resistance at 1.3990. USD/SGD is down 0.1% at 1.3952. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com) 

  0723 GMT - Gold prices slide in early trading in New York as headwinds over economic uncertainty continue to push investors toward other safe-haven assets over the precious metal. Prices are down 0.2% to $1,821.50 a troy ounce, marking a three-month low for the metal. The U.S. dollar strengthened to its highest level since March 2020 on Thursday, providing further pressure for gold. ""Gold's status as an inflation hedge is waning, as the risk of more aggressive monetary tightening rises,"" ANZ Research says in a note. ""That said, the darkening economic backdrop and subsequent sell-off in equity markets should provide some support."" (yusuf.khan@wsj.com) 

  0715 GMT - The U.S. dollar's gains are unstoppable, say LBBW's analysts in a note. ""For the time being, we expect the dollar strength to prevail."" On Thursday, the dollar benefited from market nervousness and technical factors as the euro dropped out of the $1.05-$1.06 range it's been in since late April, they say. EUR/USD is last at 1.0401, having hit a multi-year low of 1.0358 on Thursday. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

448,"Funds: Investing in Growth With Less Drama -- Barron&apos;s

By Lewis Braham 

     It has been a brutal year for growth investing. The average growth-focused mutual fund is down by more than 30% in 2022 as of June 13, according to fund tracker Morningstar. 

     Yet growth stocks could well be worth buying now. The growth-stock universe is priced at about a 20% discount to estimates of fair value by Morningstar analysts. But that doesn't mean stocks can't get cheaper. In today's volatile markets, investors should remain wary of super-aggressive funds like ARK Innovation (ticker: ARKK), which was up 152% in 2020 and is down more than 50% in 2022. 

     For investors who can't stomach gut-wrenching volatility, a more cautious approach toward growth is warranted. One way to find lower-risk growth funds is to look at their volatility stats. 

     A fund like MFS Massachusetts Investors Growth Stock (MIGFX) could fit the bill. It has a standard deviation -- a volatility measure -- of 17.8%, while the average fund in Morningstar's Large Growth category sits at 20.9%. The MFS fund's beta -- a measure of market sensitivity -- is 0.96, indicating if the market rises or falls 10%, it rises and falls 9.6%. The average large-growth fund rises and falls 5% more than the market with a beta of 1.05. By comparison, ARK Innovation has a 1.73 beta and a 43% standard deviation -- way more volatile. The MFS fund is down 21.8% in 2022, besting 90% of its peers, which average minus 30%. 

     Yet volatility stats are all in the rearview mirror. It's important to understand why a fund has been less volatile, and whether its risk profile is sustainable. That requires digging into the manager's strategy. ""We focus on owning high-quality, durable [earnings] growth compounders that we believe will have relatively resilient fundamentals even through challenging times,"" Jeff Constantino, Massachusetts Investors Growth's co-manager, tells Barron's. ""This leads us to favor companies with strong sustainable competitive advantages, or wide economic moats, typically with high profit margins, [product] pricing power, strong balance sheets, and significant cash-flow generation."" 

     Quality, admittedly an ambiguous term, is a recurrent theme for many defensive growth-stock funds. Typically, a high-quality company has a dominant market position in its industry and high barriers to entry for competitors -- as Warren Buffett calls it, an ""economic moat."" Such dominance gives it price control over its products, a valuable advantage in today's inflationary environment. 

     ""Our companies, for the most part, should be able to increase pricing to offset [their increased] costs,"" says Brett Reiner, co-manager of Neuberger Berman Genesis (NBGNX). He points to one of his largest holdings -- Pool Corp. (POOL), a pool equipment supplier: ""They're the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies in the U.S., with a 35 to 40% market share, multiples higher than the next biggest player in the industry."" Despite a dramatic 34.5% decline in Pool's stock price in 2022, Reiner thinks the company's dominance can enable it to pass on higher costs to its customers via price hikes. 

     The Neuberger fund is interesting, as it is one of the few low-risk small-cap growth funds. It's easier to find dominant blue-chip growth companies with wide moats, such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT). There aren't many search engines that can compete with Google. 

     Reiner searches for small companies in a niche business they can dominate. Yet he still has a healthy 26.8% weighting in technology, a sector ruled by behemoths. ""We stay away from businesses that have to compete directly with those 800-pound gorillas,"" he says. Instead, he invests in companies like Manhattan Associates (MANH), which provides reasonably priced but difficult to replace ""mission critical"" supply-chain software to businesses. 

     There are low-cost index exchange-traded funds that focus on wide-moat companies, but many lack another important ingredient to risk control -- a focus on valuation. Most defensive actively managed mutual funds employ a growth-at-a-reasonable price, or GARP, strategy -- not a growth-at-any-price one. This is especially important now, as rising bond interest rates hurt expensive stocks the most. That's because bonds pay their yields up front, while expensive stocks promise profits in the distant future. The higher the average bond's yield, the less willing stock investors are to wait on a pricey stock's promised growth. 

     For this reason, in the ETF space it might make more sense to buy a blended fund that incorporates growth and value factors in its selection process -- such as VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat (MOAT) or Franklin LibertyQ US Equity (FLQL) -- than a pure growth one like Vanguard Mega Cap Growth (MGK). The VanEck and Franklin ETFs are each down about 17% to 18% this year, versus Vanguard Mega Cap Growth's minus 32%. 

     In the mutual fund space, Massachusetts Investors Growth, Neuberger Berman Genesis, Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), Calvert Equity (CSIEX), and Janus Henderson Enterprise (JAENX) all employ valuation disciplines to keep risk in line. 

     Morningstar's director of manager research, Russ Kinnel, is particularly fond of Jensen Quality Growth. While it can still get hurt in market downturns or recessions, its strict quality and valuation discipline protect it, he says: ""If I'm wrong, and the recession has another leg down, or the market is down, I'm still going to make [my investment] back because there's some good defense characteristics here."" 

     There are other ways to control risk. In addition to seeking high-quality companies, Capital Advisors Growth (CIAOX) typically holds some cash -- 11% of its portfolio as of March 31 -- for defensive reasons. It's down 19.9% in 2022. Pacer Trendpilot 100 (PTNQ) can go to 100% cash if market conditions are rough. 

     Of course, holding cash at a market bottom could cause you to lose significant upside in a recovery. If you're going to play growth stocks today, you have to be willing to accept the potential for some pain, albeit hopefully not too much.

449,"Japan Central Bank Chief Apologizes Over Inflation Comment -- WSJ

  By Megumi Fujikawa 

 

     TOKYO -- The Japanese central bank's governor apologized Wednesday for a comment suggesting he liked the way consumers were going along with higher prices, highlighting the political sensitivities of the yen's fall to a 20-year low. 

     The yen touched 134 yen to the dollar Wednesday, the lowest level since February 2002. The yen's value in dollar terms has fallen 16% since the beginning of the year, accelerating inflationary pressures because it takes more yen to buy imported goods denominated in dollars. Energy is a particular concern because Japan imports almost all of its oil and gas and needs dollars to pay for it. 

     In a speech Monday, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda pointed to data suggesting Japanese consumers have developed more tolerance for price rises. He seemed to welcome the trend as a sign the nation was getting away from a decadeslong deflationary mind-set that the central bank has blamed for keeping the economy in the doldrums. 

     But with parliamentary elections coming up in July, opposition parties seized on the comments to accuse Mr. Kuroda of cheering on high inflation. A Twitter hashtag that translates as ""we do not accept higher prices"" was trending. 

     Summoned to a parliamentary committee, Mr. Kuroda issued an apology. 

     ""The expression that households are tolerating price increases was completely inappropriate, and I take it back,"" Mr. Kuroda said. He said he recognized that paying more at the store was a painful choice for consumers and not something they welcomed. 

     Japan's consumer prices are rising at the fastest pace in three decades, although the inflation rate of 2.5% in April was well below 8.3% in the U.S. 

     The development is awkward for the Bank of Japan because it has long sought to achieve inflation of around 2%, but not in the way it is happening now. In the central bank's preferred scenario, modest price rises would come in tandem with wage increases and help generate a virtuous cycle of corporate investment and economic growth. Japan's ultralow interest rates would provide greater stimulus if wages and prices were rising steadily. 

     The only part of the scenario coming to fruition, at least for now, is the rise in prices. 

     Mr. Kuroda tried to make the best of the situation in his Monday remarks, saying more-entrenched inflation could ""lead to a full-fledged rise in wages"" next year. 

     He referred in the speech to a recent survey by Tsutomu Watanabe, a University of Tokyo professor and former Bank of Japan official, that asked consumers in several countries how they would react if the price of a product they always buy in the supermarket went up by 10%. 

     The survey found 56% of Japanese consumers would stick to their buying habits, compared with 43% in August 2021 -- a shift Mr. Kuroda called an improvement. The latest figure in the U.S. was 64%. 

     Social-media commentators said they didn't see anything improving. A Twitter user said people had no choice when buying daily essentials. ""Everyone is in trouble. We do not accept it. Don't be foolish,"" she wrote. 

     Fast Retailing Co., which operates Uniqlo clothing stores, said this week it planned to raise prices in Japan on some items in its autumn and winter collection, such as a fleece jacket that will cost Yen2,990, equivalent to $22, up from Yen1,990 previously. It named the weak yen as one reason. 

     Opposition parties are seizing on such cases to attack Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose ruling party is expected to cruise to victory in elections for Parliament's less-powerful upper chamber in July. Polls show Mr. Kishida enjoys widespread support, but inflation is one of his few weak points. 

     The opposition Constitutional Democratic Party has named inflation as its top campaign issue. It accused the Bank of Japan of ignoring the yen's fall and suggested it would look at raising interest rates to prop up the yen. 

     Mr. Kuroda has repeatedly rejected that idea, saying the economy still needs the stimulus provided by low interest rates. By contrast, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates quickly to fight inflation, helping push up the dollar.

450,"Growth Fears Challenge Soaring Oil Prices -- WSJ

  By Matt Grossman 

 

     War, the pandemic and world-wide supply problems held oil prices near their highest levels in almost a decade this past quarter. Slowing growth may be the biggest threat to the rally. 

     Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, finished June not far from where it came into April, rising 7.7% to $116.26 since the start of the quarter through Wednesday. That was little consolation to drivers at the gas station or truckers and airlines buying diesel and jet fuel as they adjusted to record prices during the first lasting stretch of over-$100-a-barrel crude in almost 10 years. Not since 2013 has a quarter brought a higher average daily closing price for Brent-crude contracts, according to Dow Jones data. 

     Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, anxiety about global oil supplies ha s collided with growing demand as the world emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. That tension accelerated in early June after China eased its latest round of lockdowns, boosting demand and helping send Brent futures briefly spiking above $120 a barrel. 

     Meanwhile, oil producers have responded with only limited new investments in pumping more oil, chastened by environmentalist scrutiny of fossil fuels and by their record of overinvestment during previous price surges. That has kept supply forecasts tight. 

     ""The big picture is that global demand for oil is back to, if not exceeding, pre-Covid levels, but global supply is not,"" said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Kansas-based investment firm TortoiseEcofin. ""We're continuing to have this persistently undersupplied oil market."" 

     Pricier crude hits U.S. consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices, which reached an average of $5 a gallon nationally for the first time this month. By raising costs for companies, higher fuel prices also contribute to faster inflation in a broad set of goods and services. 

     Meanwhile, prices for diesel, the fuel of choice for many commercial vehicles, are up about 78% from last year at $5.780 a gallon, according to AAA, further raising companies' fuel costs. Jet fuel prices have also rocketed higher. 

     That has made crude oil a key driver of the soaring inflation that has rattled financial markets this spring. Central banks' mounting response, which this month brought the biggest Federal Reserve interest-rate increase since 1994, have fueled fears of a potential recession. 

     Those concerns, investors say, are one of the few factors working to keep a lid on oil prices. As growth fears have mounted, crude prices through Wednesday were on track in June to record their first down month since November 2021. 

     ""There is a growth slowdown happening, and if you enter into that situation, there's going to be a demand drop for oil,"" said Maneesh Deshpande, a Barclays analyst. ""That's part of the reason why oil has sold off a bit."" 

     Mr. Deshpande's analysis notes that energy-company stocks -- still the only S&P 500 sector that has posted a gain so far this year -- have also fallen sharply in recent weeks. That could be a sign traders are concerned about how a future recession might hit demand. 

     The same trend shows up in futures markets, where far-off contracts are trading at a discount to near-term deliveries. Brent crude for delivery at the end of December costs $101.27 a barrel, somewhat lower than the near-term price, according to FactSet. The price drops to less than $93 a barrel for December 2023 deliveries. 

     As geopolitics roil commodity markets, governments have stepped in to try to ease conditions for drivers and other energy consumers. Western leaders are struggling to balance two goals: inflicting economic pain on Russia, a major exporter, while stanching the runaway fuel prices that have battered their citizens' wallets. 

     This week, the Group of Seven club of wealthy democracies was working toward a global price cap on Russian oil, aimed at cutting revenue for Russian producers while keeping the country's crude exports flowing to willing buyers in Asia. The European Union earlier moved to ban seaborne imports of Russian oil by December. 

     Meanwhile, the Biden administration and allies of the U.S. have laid out plans to release hundreds of millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves this year to boost supply and ease prices. 

     Even so, moves like those haven't brought relief to fuel prices, in part because many refiners don't have the spare capacity to turn more oil into gasoline. Instead, U.S. producers are sending more crude abroad than ever before. Oil exports from the Gulf Coast likely hit a record 3.3 million barrels a day in the three months through June, research firm Rystad Energy estimated. 

     As supply concerns persist, there is little sign of easing prices for fuel consumers barring a recession that would ease demand for crude, Pimco analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. 

     ""Many commodity markets face a very fine balance this summer,"" the Pimco team said. ""Our concern now is that additional energy supply disruptions...will require demand rationing, since there is so little capacity to increase supply in the short term.""

451,"EMEA Morning Briefing: Hot Inflation Print Triggers Market Shock Waves as Next Fed Move Eyed

  MARKET WRAPS 

  Watch For: 

  EU Long term interest rates statistics; UK Index of Production, Trade, Index of Services, Monthly GDP Estimates, Business Finance Review, NIESR Monthly GDP Tracker; Italy Labour Cost Index; OECD Composite Leading Indicators; no major corporate updates expected 

  Opening Call: 

  European shares face further steep losses as investors price a more aggressive Fed tightening path. In Asia, stocks tumbled, the dollar and Treasury yields added to gains while commodities weakened across the board. 

  Equities: 

  European and U.S. stock futures sold off Monday as investors remained nervous following the hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation print and ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting 

  Fed policy-makers are expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points this, though some economists think that after Friday's data, there may be support for a more aggressive 75-basis-point hike. 

  Read: 'Doves Don't Exist on the FOMC Right Now': Economists Expect Hawkish Fed Meeting This Week 

  ""U.S. CPI for May was a nightmare for risk markets,"" wrote Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. ""The market is now thinking much more about the Fed driving rates sharply higher to get on top of inflation and then having to cut back as growth drops."" 

  That will leave traders and investors ""deliberating how much further tightening central banks' will be able to deliver and, therefore, how much higher yields can go from here. And we all know nothing ever good happens when interest rate volatility spikes in capital markets,"" he said. 

  Forex: 

  The dollar strengthened further against a basket of major currencies on heightened fears over the Fed's tightening path. 

  In Asian trading, the greenback climbed 0.4% to 134.89 yen after earlier touching Y134.99, the highest intraday level since October 1, 1988. 

  Read: Yen Takes Beating in Global Market Rout 

  Karl Schamotta at Corpay said Friday that consumer prices rising by more than expected in May has lifted the odds on a 50 basis-point increase at the Fed's September meeting...He noted that a 50 bp increase was already widely expected for June and July but now the market prices a similar sized move in September at nearly 100%. 

  ""The federal funds rate is now seen hitting 3 percent by year end, tilting interest differentials further in the greenback's favor."" 

  --- 

  Sterling could fall as the Bank of England is unlikely to deliver on the market's interest rate rise expectations, said Unicredit Research. ""Markets continue to price in an aggressive tightening by the BOE, despite signs of deterioration already emerging in the U.K. economy."" 

  The BOE will probably lift its key rate 25 basis points to 1.25% Thursday followed by a hike to 1.50% in August but will keep rates steady thereafter, whereas the market expects at least four more 25bp rises after June, said forex strategist Roberto Mialich. 

  Unicredit expects GBP/USD to fall below 1.20 and EUR/GBP to rise above 0.95 over the medium-term. 

  Bonds: 

  Treasury yields continued to rise in Asia after yields on 2- and 10-year notes hit their highest levels in years Friday, while part of the curve inverted, following the U.S. inflation data. 

  ""Friday's inflation data suggests the 'peak inflation' debate may be premature,"" said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management. 

  ""Investors remain too confident that the Federal Reserve will be able to control inflation. We should not take the Fed's ability to control inflation as a given."" 

  Energy: 

  Oil futures extended their recent retreat as recession concerns mount, sparked by the latest U.S. inflation print. 

  Expectations for more aggressive Fed policy tightening have hit fresh highs, driving recession fears to ""multi-storey levels"" and compounded by clouds forming again over China's reopening from its Covid-19 outbreak, said SPI's Stephen Innes. 

  Weakness for crude, however, was relatively subdued, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA. 

  ""Some traders are entering de-risking mode as prospects for the economy continue to dim, but no one really wants to abandon the best trade of the year, which is oil and energy stocks,"" he said. 

  Metals: 

  Gold futures edged lower as the dollar continued to climb on the Fed's tightening path and growing economic risks. However, Phillip Securities said demand for safe haven assets like gold may be supported in the near term. 

  --- 

  Base metals weakened on the slump in risk appetite following the U.S. CPI data. ING said the market now expects not just more frontloading of the Fed's rate increases, but a higher peak as well. 

  Iron ore futures also fell sharply, although analysts said prices may be supported by hopes for stimulus measures from China. 

  The Chinese government is now looking to ramp up monetary and fiscal support, said Citi analysts, adding that the infrastructure construction pipeline still looks robust, although this is subject to Covid-19 lockdowns. 

   
 
 

  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES 

  Earnings Are Under Threat, Another Blow to Sagging Stock Market 

  Stocks have fallen this year in the face of rising interest rates. With inflation showing little sign of cooling, many investors fear corporate earnings could be the market's next support to fall. 

  The S&P 500 has dropped 18% in 2022, its worst start to a year since 1962, as the Federal Reserve embarks on a rate-rising campaign to bring down four-decade-high inflation. The tightening of monetary policy has trampled on the rich valuations stocks carried at the start of the year, leaving earnings growth as a key pillar for the market to regain its footing. 

   
 
 

  Food Prices to Keep Going Up, as Costs Surge 

  Some of the nation's biggest food suppliers and restaurants, including Kraft Heinz Co. and some McDonald's Corp. franchisees, said they would continue to raise prices as they face starkly higher costs. 

  Kraft Heinz notified retailer customers this past Monday that it would raise prices in August on items ranging from Miracle Whip and Classico pasta sauce to Maxwell House coffee products and some deli meat. 

   
 
 

  Japan's Yen Usually Benefits When Markets Get Ugly. Not This Time 

  A surge of U.S. inflation is hammering the Japanese yen, a currency that typically strengthens on bad economic news. 

  The yen is approaching its weakest point since 2002, stuck between a strong U.S. dollar and Japan's easy-money policy. The dollar rose as the global economy's prospects dimmed, hurt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a jump in U.S. inflation and an economic slowdown in China. An index that measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies is up more than 12% over the past year. The dollar has advanced 22% against the yen during that time. 

   
 
 

  Pandemic, War in Ukraine Create New Challenges for Struggling WTO 

  WASHINGTON-Fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine are creating new challenges for the World Trade Organization, which has struggled in recent years to play its role as the regulator and arbiter of global trade. 

  Trade ministers gathering in Geneva this week for the first meeting of top officials from WTO member countries since 2017 face a mountain of pressing issues, including increasing food security amid war-induced shortages and responding to the continuing pandemic, as well as resolving long-running issues such as depletion of global fishing stocks. 

   
 
 

  Gasoline Prices Reach $5 a Gallon Nationwide for the First Time 

  The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas in the U.S. hit $5 Friday night, and the rise in fuel costs is expected to persist throughout the busy summer driving season. 

  The record high, according to OPIS, an energy-data and analytics provider, comes as U.S. consumer inflation hit its highest level in 40 years and crude oil prices remain high. 

   
 
 

  Abandon Stocks for Bonds? If Only Life Were So Simple. 

  The good news: At last, there is a worthwhile alternative to stocks. Bonds sport far more attractive yields than they have in years. 

  The bad news: Benchmark U.S. Treasurys have been crushed this year alongside stocks. Both the 10-year bond and the S&P 500 were down an unlucky 13% for the year up to the middle of this week, although stocks were then hit much harder by Friday's bad inflation figures than bonds were. Meanwhile junk bonds, the highest-yielding corporate bonds, bring similar exposure to a potential worsening of corporate fundamentals as shares. 

   
 
 

  Macron's Majority in French Parliament at Risk in Neck-and-Neck Races 

  PARIS-President Emmanuel Macron was at risk of losing his majority in the National Assembly after projections based on early ballot counts of the first round of France's parliamentary elections Sunday showed his candidates running neck and neck with leftist rivals, complicating the French leader's efforts to press ahead with his pro-business agenda. 

  A projection by polling firm Harris Interactive estimated that Mr. Macron's candidates and those of far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon each garnered 25% of the nationwide tally. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally won 19% of the first-round vote while the conservative Les Républicains and its allies garnered 11.5%, according to Harris Interactive. 

   
 
 

  Three-Dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine Works Safely in Young Children, Review Says 

  Three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE were effective at preventing symptomatic disease in children ages 6 months through 4 years in studies, according to U.S. health regulators. 

  The FDA staff also said, in a review of study data posted online Sunday, that there were no new safety concerns using the vaccine in young children compared with older age groups.

452,"Turkey Annual Inflation Rate Neared 80% in June

 

  By Nihad Ahmed 

 

  Turkey's annual rate of inflation surged even further in June, recording its highest print since September 1998, the country's statistics office Turkstat said Monday. 

  The consumer price index rose 78.6% in June compared with the same month of 2021. The annual inflation rate in May was 73.5%. A FactSet poll showed economists had expected the annual inflation rate to reach 79.1% in June. 

  Transportation registered the biggest on-year increase, followed by food and non-alcoholic beverages and furnishings and household equipment, Turkstat data showed. 

  A notable jump in global commodity prices due to the war in Ukraine, energy tariff hikes at the start of 2022 and sharp falls in the lira in late-2021 have underpinned the inflation surge. 

  Consumer prices were up 4.95% on month in June after rising 2.98% the previous month, the data showed.

453,"America&apos;s New Energy Crisis -- WSJ -2-

     One renewable-energy developer, Recurrent Energy, filed more than 20 of these grid-connection requests last year in California, a state that needs more clean power to replace several gas-fired power plants as well as a nuclear plant slated for retirement in the coming years. It took the company seven years to get approval and construct a separate battery storage project in that state. 

     ""It's only getting harder and harder to get things done in California, specifically, but in every market,"" said President and General Manager Michael Arndt. 

     Wait times can be years for other projects that could also help alleviate energy shortages, such as high-voltage power lines to carry electricity between regions, natural gas pipelines and offshore wind farms capable of generating large amounts of clean power. These require land and ecological studies that many stakeholders say are critical to protecting wildlife, nearby industries and other interests. 

     The strain is already evident in the Midwest, where Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc. operates a regional grid across multiple states. One of its biggest challenges, said Chief Executive John Bear, is how to replace coal- and gas-fired power plants that can produce power on demand with wind and solar farms where output fluctuates with weather and time of day. 

     When electricity supplies get tight, MISO calls on every available generator to produce power in what's known as a ""MaxGen"" event, something that rarely occurred before 2016. Since then, MISO has had more than 40 MaxGen events, a number of which occurred outside the summer months, when demand is typically highest. 

     MISO this past week approved a sweeping plan to build high-voltage power lines to help balance supplies, though the projects aren't expected to be complete until 2030. It is also considering how to better compensate power plants for operating on standby to slow the pace of closures. ""The transition may require some scaffolding, and that scaffolding may be some gas plants,"" Mr. Bear said. 

     Project delays -- coupled with higher gas prices -- present new challenges for utilities, too. They are paying more to produce or purchase electricity while planning big spending increases to upgrade aging infrastructure and prepare for new energy demands. 

     Xcel Energy Inc., a Minneapolis-based utility company serving parts of eight Western and Midwestern states, is wrestling with slowdowns on solar projects. Those include contracts with solar farms in Colorado that were scheduled to be online in late 2022 and early 2023. 

     Xcel, through one of its subsidiaries, is now working on contingency plans to ensure adequate supplies for next summer. It plans to invest $26 billion between 2022 and 2026 partly so it can build more high-voltage power lines to carry more power from new wind and solar farms. 

     Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said higher energy prices pose near-term challenges for the company and its customers, but he expects they will fall with time. The war in Ukraine, the pandemic and supply chain snarls, he added, would have been easier to manage if they didn't converge. 

     ""You put those three factors in a mixing bowl, and you come up with a bigger challenge,"" Mr. Frenzel said. 

     'No one knows what to do' 

     The actions of the U.S. government also contributed to this current crisis. Federal decisions made over the last three decades to encourage competition, lower costs for consumers, sell oil and gas to foreign buyers and encourage the development of more renewable sources are having unintended consequences now that the energy market is in turmoil. 

     It began with the decision to deregulate the electricity industry, a movement that first gained support following the energy shortages of the 1970s and gathered more momentum with the 1992 passage of the Energy Policy Act, which encouraged competition among wholesale electricity suppliers. The federal government also lifted price caps on natural gas and created incentives for more renewable energy sources to take root in markets around the country, hoping to prop up technologies that didn't rely on oil and gas. 

     What this new system created in the subsequent decades was a patchwork of markets across much of the country with different regional operators, leaving state regulators and power grid managers to do much of the planning. Coordination across regions became more challenging as states set different goals to reduce carbon emissions. 

     Consider what happened in California when the state experienced rolling blackouts in 2020 after temperatures rose across the West. The state had substantially reduced its reliance on gas-fired power plants in recent years in favor of renewable energy, giving way to evening supply crunches on hot days when solar production tapers off. California has historically imported a lot of power from neighboring states in times of need, but it was constrained in its ability to do so during the 2020 heat wave because neighboring states also had numerous plants close and thus had less power to spare. 

     ""You had too much capacity come off the market too quickly and now all the markets are scrambling for reliability,"" said John Arnold, a former natural gas trader who now is a billionaire philanthropist. 

     Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden all encouraged U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas. The U.S. became the world's top LNG exporter this year as it sent huge volumes to Europe to help replace Russian supplies. But those same exports are now driving up domestic gas prices because U.S. consumers are effectively competing for supplies with foreign buyers, say analysts, and will keep prices elevated for years to come due to long-term supply contracts signed by exporters. 

     The U.S. government has more recently taken steps to help with the nation's transition to renewable energy sources. For example, it expanded its authority to intervene in state-level permitting processes for high-voltage power lines as a way of helping balance electricity supply and demand across regions. Mr. Biden is also trying to lower high energy prices by asking Saudi Arabia, which he had vowed to treat as a ""pariah"" after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to pump more crude. He traveled there earlier this month. 

     One former regulator said the current situation reminds him of a period five decades ago when an Arab oil embargo and revolution in Iran led to a rethinking of energy policy in the U.S. and Europe. But it is also different, he said. 

     ""The crisis now is much worse than it was in the 70s,"" said Bernard McNamee, a Republican former member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ""Everyone is looking around, and no one seems to know what to do.""

Ville Iho, CEO: Demand is strong, but supply challenges limit growth and 
weigh on profitability 
 
Strong continuous demand supported Terveystalo's growth in the second 
quarter of the year. Revenue increased by almost 16 % year-on-year, of 
which Sweden's share was approximately 9%-points. Acquisitions 
contributed about a half of the revenue growth in Finland. Booking rates 
for health services remained very high and supply limited organic sales 
growth in most services. The supply that fell short of the targets, the 
weakened sales mix and the personnel costs raised by acquisitions, among 
other things, weighed on profitability despite strong demand and growth. 
Adjusted EBITA decreased by 18.2 percent to 24.1 million euros and was 
7.6 percent of the revenue. 
 
The supply grew modestly compared to a year ago, still focusing on 
digital services. However, we succeeded in recruiting new professionals 
during the period and the number of private practitioners increased by 
more than 10 percent. This positive development will be reflected in the 
actual supply figures with a delay. To strengthen the supply, we are 
moving even more of our development efforts into solutions that help our 
professionals work more efficiently. Job satisfaction at Terveystalo 
continues at high level with Employee Net Promoter Score, eNPS reaching 
30 in the latest survey. 
 
The number of Covid-19 tests decreased according to our assumptions, 
while other diagnostics are yet to return to the pre-pandemic levels. 
The sales mix was also negatively affected by the supply falling short 
of the targets, as the appointments of contracted customers took 
capacity from higher-margin private customer care chains. Personnel 
costs increased because of acquisitions, growth investments in new 
businesses, and proactive recruitment. 
 
The Swedish business continued to develop according to our plans. In the 
second quarter, we continued with complementary acquisitions and 
expanded the range of services for new payer groups. 
 
The number of digital appointments continued to grow strongly, 28 
percent year-on-year. Outside of our own services, Terveystalo's digital 
solutions are being piloted for the first time by public sector 
customers. Our goal is to continue to lead the renewal of our industry 
in Finland, Sweden and in the future in new markets. With more efficient 
use of health data, better care management and the use of digital 
appointments it is possible to improve access to care, job satisfaction, 
as well as productivity . During the fall, in addition to developing 
digital partnerships in the public healthcare, we will take the 
occupational health digital suite to Sweden. 
 
Terveystalo's market position and competitiveness are strong. We have 
grown rapidly, especially in digital services, new businesses, and the 
Swedish market, and have exceeded our growth targets many times over. In 
a strong demand environment, our focus has been on growth and customer 
experience, which is also reflected in relatively faster growing 
personnel costs. In an environment where inflationary pressures are 
combined with a tight labor market and general economic uncertainty, we 
will emphasize profitability in relation to growth. We continue to 
invest in the long-term competitiveness of our business, but the 
changing environment will be reflected in investment priorities, 
criteria for acquisitions in new business areas and timing of 
recruitments. We also need to review the pricing of our services so that 
it is in line with the general cost level increase. 
 
The megatrends driving demand for health services have intensified 
during the pandemic, and despite economic uncertainty, demand is very 
high. Our mission to fight for a healthier life is more relevant than 
ever, and as the leading private healthcare service provider in our core 
market, we play a key role in the lives of people and work communities. 
We are committed to our vision of creating a world with fewer sick days 
and more healthy, happy years. 
 
Towards a better tomorrow, 
 
Ville Iho 
 
Outlook 
 
  · Demand for health services is very strong and broad based. However, 
growth is restricted by supply. Tight labour market and rising inflation 
create growing pressure on operating costs, including wages. 
  · The demand for services related to COVID-19 is expected to decrease. 
However, predicting the volume is difficult. The overall demand for 
health services is expected to remain at a high level. The demand for 
digital services is expected to continue to grow. 
  · Demand from corporate customers for preventive and statutory 
occupational health services is expected to develop favourably. Demand 
for medical care is expected to continue strong. Significant changes in 
the employment rate may be reflected in the underlying demand. 
  · Overall demand is expected to remain strong in the private customer 
segment. Significant decline in general consumer confidence may, 
however, be reflected in the demand. 
  · Demand from the public sector is expected to remain strong in 
occupational health, service sales, and staffing services. Revenue from 
the outsourcing business is expected to remain stable. Tight labour 
market creates pressure especially on the salary costs of new and 
replacement recruitments in staffing and outsourcing services. 
  · Demand in the Swedish occupational health market is expected to 
develop favourably due to pent-up demand in the wake of the pandemic. 
 
These views are based on the expected development of demand for 
Terveystalo' s services within the next six months, compared with the 
past six months. 
 
The impacts of COVID-19 and the measures taken by Terveystalo 
 
During the second quarter of 2022, in Terveystalo' s service production 
the share of various COVID-19-related services decreased year-on-year. 
Well-being and digital services continued to grow. 
 
The impacts of the war in Ukraine 
 
The indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine on Terveystalo are assessed 
to be minimal, as Terveystalo does not have business operations in, or 
with, countries that are subject to sanctions. Indirect impacts of the 
war may arise from supply chain disruptions, rising inflation, or 
potential disruptions in the financial markets. The war may also have a 
delayed economic impact through declining consumer purchasing power and 
employment. If the situation were to be prolonged, this could have a 
negative impact on the demand for Terveystalo's services. In 
procurement, higher prices have been reflected in the prices of certain 
supplies (material purchasing accounts for approximately 3% of operating 
expenditure), but the most significant purchasing agreements for 2022 
have already been concluded.  The rising price of electricity affects 
operating expenditure, but its impact at the Group level is relatively 
minor. Delivery times have become longer in certain categories of 
products and materials, such as healthcare equipment, due to component 
shortages. 
 
Rising inflation creates growing pressure to increase wages. Wage 
increases are determined by collective bargaining in the Finnish 
healthcare industry regarding nurses, for example (approximately 43% of 
employees). Wage inflation is also visible in other professionals' 
recruitments. Most of the physicians who work for Terveystalo are 
private practitioners (approximately 96%). The financial risk associated 
with inflation is mitigated by Terveystalo's ability to price its 
services.

455,"England&apos;s Coastal Villages Are Quaint and Charming. Second Home-Owners Are Taking the Bait. -- WSJ

  By Ruth Bloomfield | Photographs and Videos by Adj Brown for The Wall Street Journal 

 

     The pandemic was a tipping point in the lives of Jilly and Alex Scott. 

     The couple lived in the affluent country town of Cheltenham, 95 miles west of London, and since 2016 owned a small cottage they used for vacations and weekends in St Mawes, a picturesque coastal fishing village in Cornwall, England's westernmost county. 

     But, while locked down in 2020, they decided that, rather than spend a few weeks a year by the sea, they would like to decamp permanently to Cornwall. Instead of moving into the four-bedroom house they already owned, they traded up to a larger property: a 1930s house overlooking the estuary of the Percuil River for which the Scotts, both 53, paid $1.15 million in 2020. The couple, founders and directors of Boo Homes, a boutique property developer, completed a $1.2 million renovation and moved in during August 2021. 

     The couple extended their new house from about 2,000 square feet to about 3,000 square feet, and estimate it is now worth around $3.6 million. This price growth is partly because, according to research from estate agent Hamptons, average prices in St Mawes have climbed 26% in the past two years, to $573,168. Mrs. Scott reports that the welcome from the local community has been warm, and the St Mawes lifestyle is everything she and her family had hoped for. Their downtime is spent on their boat, fishing, or at the beach. 

     The Scotts' experience is being replicated in small coastal enclaves around the UK. Capital-rich buyers from out-of-town, often Londoners, many of whom aren't expecting to return to the office, are relocating to charming, coastal communities. The result has been a series of housing booms in resort towns and villages that were already disproportionately expensive before two years of sustained growth. 

     While exponential price growth may be good news for owners, it is bad news for local people with average incomes who have been frozen out of the property market altogether. Danny O'Flynn was born and raised in Padstow, one of Cornwall's most fashionable resorts thanks to its fine restaurants and beautiful scenery. Prices in Padstow were among the highest in Cornwall prepandemic and have grown an additional 3% in the last two years, to hit $551,576. 

     Mr. O'Flynn, 42, is a master baker at The Chough Bakery and earns around $36,000 a year. In 2016, he and his wife, Paige, 30, had to move to the less expensive village of Trevone, two miles inland. Using a subsidized affordable housing scheme, they bought a two-bedroom house, which they live in with their three daughters, aged 7, 4 and 1. 

     ""We couldn't afford to live in Padstow, and the house we have got is too small for us,"" he said. ""I don't know what we are going to do. A lot of my friends have moved right away from Cornwall because of this problem. Because unless somebody in your family dies and leaves you some money or a house, you can't afford to buy a house in Padstow."" 

     Mr. O'Flynn said his hometown has changed dramatically during his lifetime. ""Years ago nobody wanted to live in the little cottages along the quay,"" he said. ""Now they cost GBP750,000 [$898,650]. ""I remember when you knew everybody in the pubs and in the street in Padstow but they have all gone. The community is not what it was. It's sad, really."" 

     Mr. O'Flynn recognizes the irony of his plight. Without tourism, he said, businesses like the bakery he works at would struggle. But he also knows that the influx of second-home owners and investors buying vacation rentals has driven up real-estate values. ""We need more of a happy medium,"" he said. 

     This phenomenon isn't confined to the west of England. In Wells-next-the-Sea, a tiny, pretty fishing village in the east coast county of Norfolk, average sale prices have jumped 69% in the past decade to $556,397, around 50% more than the county average of $352,331.Competition for homes is fierce. Johnny Lane, residential sales manager at William H Brown estate agents, recently sold a four-bedroom, roughly 1,300-square-foot house without a sea view for $144,000 above its $569,287 asking price after 26 buyers viewed it in a single day. 

     ""To be honest, most buyers are from outside the area because local people have been priced out,"" he said. ""I would say that around 85% of buyers are from outside Norfolk, certainly outside Wells."" 

     In Mumbles, a fishing village in south Wales turned property gold mine, Hamptons found that its average sale prices jumped 24% in the past two years to $468,454. Chris Hope, senior partner at the village's Fine & Country estate agents, said that with the sea on one side and a stretch of protected countryside on the other, there are few opportunities for new-home construction and demand vastly exceeds supply. 

     This means that a three-bedroom cottage with a sea view would sell for around $599,000. ""If you moved that same property 4 miles inland it would probably cost about GBP150,000 [$180,000],"" said Mr. Hope. 

     One of the most extreme examples of how coastal prices have spiraled is to be found in Salcombe, a chic sailing village in Cornwall's neighboring county, Devon. Hamptons found that average sale prices have grown 60% in a decade to hit close to $1 million. 

     Competitive bidding has become the norm in Salcombe rather than a rarity, said Victoria Lambden, manager of Marchand Petit estate agents. She recently sold a roughly 700-square-foot apartment, listed with a guide price of $898,000, for just under $1.2 million after eight bidders made offers. A four-bedroom house on the outskirts of the town, with a guide price of $952,000, sold for $1.265 million after 18 bids were received. 

     Back in St Mawes, Mark Willson, managing director of H Tiddy estate agents, reports that his firm has sold double the number of homes a year during the pandemic than it did in previous years, with prices hitting $1,557 to $1,677 per square foot for homes with a sea view. 

     Mr. Willson has sold two three- to four-bedroom cottages overlooking St Mawes harbor in the past two years for in excess of $2.4 million. But despite these stiff prices, Mr. Willson's list of prospective buyers has grown from 1,500 people to more than 4,000 during the pandemic. 

     While business is brisk for real-estate agents, many local people share Mr. O'Flynn's concerns. In summer 2021, Cath Navin was inspired to co-found the group First Not Second Homes to help the longtime residents of communities around the U.K. who feel they are being engulfed by new arrivals. 

     ""It is impossible for young people to buy, and expensive to rent, so they are being driven away,"" said Mrs. Navin, 51, who has lived in Cornwall most of her life and runs a catering company. She is particularly concerned by people who buy holiday homes that are only used for a few weeks a year, or who outbid locals to buy properties to rent out to tourists. ""We have 21,000 homeless people in Cornwall, so I think that is a legitimate gripe,"" she said. 

     Ms. Navin would like to see tough government action, including a ban on selling newly built homes to vacation-home owners, restrictions on the number of owners allowed to offer short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb, and greater investment in social housing, including, controversially, the forced purchase of vacation properties left empty for most of the year. 

     To date, political response has been muted. The Queen's Speech, an annual announcement of forthcoming legislation planned by the British Government, delivered this year by Prince Charles, unveiled plans to give towns and villages powers to double the local taxes payable by owners of second homes left empty. 

     Mr. Lane is doubtful a bill for around $1,000 to $2,000 a year will make much difference to buyers able to pay a typical $720,000 for a two-bedroom apartment with sea views.""You can rent a two-bedroom cottage out for up to GBP1,500 ($1,800) a week in high season, so that will cover your extra tax bill in just a week,"" he said. 

     Angus Lugsdin, 45, and his wife, Andrea Lugsdin, 44, moved to Devon in 2011. In 2020, the couple, who have daughters aged 3 and 6, needed a larger home and spent $503,000 on what they call a ""neglected"" three-bedroom Victorian cottage just outside Salcombe's borders which they plan to renovate. He suspects rising prices mean it would cost more like $743,000 today. 

     Although most locals would still class the family as newcomers, Mr. Lugsdin said he feels he has added value to the local community over the past 11 years. In 2014, he and a friend from his teenage years, Howard Davies, set up Salcombe Distilling Co., which produces Salcombe Gin and employs around 55 local people. Similarly, the Scotts said their property firm has begun building and renovating homes in St Mawes, employing local people. 

     Mr. Lugsdin said he sympathizes with staff members who complain they can't afford a home because wealthy second-home owners can easily outbid them. 

     ""If you drive into Salcombe in the winter, it is very dark in the evenings because they are all second homes and nobody is there,"" he said.

456,"Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks End Mixed After Strong Jobs Data

  MARKET SNAPSHOT 

  U.S. stocks ended mixed as jobs growth data remained strong. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note advanced to 3.08% versus 3.01% on Thursday. The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.09% to 98.76. Oil prices finished higher but logged a weekly loss as recession fears swirled. And gold futures ended slightly higher, but lower for the week. 

  MARKET WRAPS 

  EQUITIES 

  The S&P 500 inched lower, avoiding a fifth consecutive session of gains after the latest monthly jobs report beat expectations. 

  The S&P 500 was down 0.1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index inched up around 0.1%. The Labor Department's June jobs report showed that rising interest rates and high inflation are so far not affecting hiring, which remains strong. The U.S. economy added 372,000 jobs in June, well above the 250,000 expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. 

  ""On one hand, it's great to see durable demand for jobs, but pressure on the (Federal Reserve) to hike rates will depress the bulls,"" said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. 

  Earlier, in Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average ended 0.1% higher after paring some earlier gains following news that former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot during a speech. Energy and financial stocks led the gains. Oil explorer Inpex advanced 2.7% and Resona Holdings climbed 2.3%. 

  Chinese stocks ended ended lower as the auto sector retreated slightly from its recent gains amid Beijing's continued policy support for the industry. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index edged down 0.2% and the Shenzhen Composite Index was 0.3% lower. The tech-heavy ChiNext Price Index was the top loser with a 1.1% drop. Passenger car makers, car dealers and auto service providers led the downturn, after the sector jumped on Thursday on the back of officials' plan for more consumption stimulus in the industry. 

  Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX-50 closed 0.5% higher and gained 3.9% for the week, its largest weekly percentage gain since January 2021, as recession fears ebbed in world markets. Growth stocks were the best performers for the week, highlighting the increase in risk appetite -- transport tech company Eroad soared nearly 50% and online travel-booking company Serko added 11%. Beaten-down blue chips also did well. Fisher & Paykel Healthcare climbed 9.5% this week. 

  And Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.45% higher, completing its biggest weekly gain since mid-March. Commodity, tech and industrial stocks led local gains, with shares of coal, oil, gold, lithium and iron-ore companies all rising. Lithium miners Lynas, Mineral Resources, Pilbara Minerals and Liontown put on between 4.5% and 7.4%. Gold miner St Barbara jumped 9.6% after hitting its fiscal-year output guidance. The ASX 200 added 2.1% for the week. 

  COMMODITIES 

  Oil futures finished higher, but logged a weekly loss as fears of recession outweighed tight global supplies of crude. 

  West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery climbed 2% to settle at $104.79 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the front-month contract posting a 3.4% weekly fall. September Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 2.3% to $107.02 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, but suffered a 4.1% weekly decline. 

  Oil prices extended their gains for the day in the wake of a stronger-than-expected reading on U.S. job creation in June, which helped to ease worries about a possible recession that would hurt energy demand. 

  Gold prices settled higher, after briefly slipping back in the wake of better-than-expected U.S. jobs data, but posted a fourth-consecutive weekly loss as overall strength in the U.S. dollar pressured commodity prices. 

  August gold August tacked on nearly 0.2% to $1,742.30 per ounce. Prices for the most-active contract, which settled Wednesday at their lowest since late September 2021, marked a weekly loss of 3.3%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

  Fed Officials Flag Tight Jobs Market, Tout Need to Control Inflation 

  Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Friday that the U.S. central bank must bring ""sky high"" inflation under control, and predicted that a notable slowdown in growth and rising unemployment are coming to the economy. 

  ""The economy experienced a rapid recovery from the pandemic last year, but I expect growth to slow considerably this year as the waning effects of fiscal stimulus, less favorable financial conditions, and slower growth abroad all weigh on our economy,"" Mr. Williams said in the text of a speech. 

  The policy maker sees U.S. gross-domestic-product growth moderating to a less than 1% rise this year with the current 3.6% unemployment rate rising to ""somewhat above"" 4% by next year. 

   
 
 

  U.S. Added 372,000 Jobs in June 

  Employers continued to snap up workers in June-though at a slower pace than earlier in the year-in an economy that is otherwise cooling rapidly under the weight of high inflation and rising interest rates. 

  The U.S. economy added 372,000 jobs in June, the Labor Department said Friday. Hiring gains last month held near the previous three months, when companies added an average of nearly 400,000 workers, but slipped from higher totals early in the year. 

  ""The labor market is cooling from a red-hot pace, but it's far from going into a freeze,"" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. ""It's hard to get a broad retrenchment in activity when you have 372,000 more individuals receiving paychecks."" 

   
 
 

  Housing-Affordability Index Drops to Lowest Level Since 2006 

  Record home prices and higher mortgage rates in May made it the most expensive month since 2006 to buy a home, prompting more buyers to give up and pressuring sellers to cut asking prices. 

  The National Association of Realtors' housing-affordability index fell to 102.5 in May, the association said Friday, the lowest level since the index fell to 100.5 in July 2006. It was close to the lowest level since July 1990, when the index stood at 100.2. The affordability index incorporates median existing-home prices, median family incomes and average mortgage rates. 

  On a national basis, homebuying was relatively affordable in 2020 and last year, thanks to record-low mortgage rates even as strong demand sent home prices skyrocketing. But this year, mortgage rates have moved up sharply and house prices have climbed to new highs nationwide. 

   
 
 

  Japan's Shinzo Abe Championed Economy's Revival, Bolstered National Defense 

  TOKYO-Shinzo Abe, who served longer than anyone as Japan's prime minister and bolstered the nation's defense while struggling to lift its economy, died Friday at the hands of an assassin's bullet. He was 67. 

  Mr. Abe served as prime minister from December 2012 to September 2020, the longest consecutive reign since Japan created a European-style government led by a prime minister in the late 19th century. He also occupied the job in an earlier stint from 2006 to 2007 and held the record for most total days in office. 

  The heir to a political dynasty, Mr. Abe championed a revival in the economic and military strength of a country that began to stagnate in the 1990s after its meteoric rise from defeat in World War II.

  Calls for TikTok Probe Widen, Adding to Pressure on Biden to Weigh In 

  WASHINGTON-Calls for an investigation into the security risks posed by the video app TikTok are widening, adding to pressure on President Biden to make good on his year-old promise to get tough on apps that could share Americans' personal data with foreign adversaries. 

  The Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the panel's top Republican sent a joint letter to the Federal Trade Commission this week urging an investigation of TikTok's data-handling and other practices. TikTok's parent, ByteDance Ltd., has its headquarters in Beijing. 

  The letter from Sens. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) followed reports by BuzzFeed that ByteDance's employees in China have repeatedly accessed U.S. users' personal data.

457,"Latin America&apos;s New Leaders Are Embracing State Authority -- Barrons.com

By Eric Farnsworth 

     About the author: Eric Farnsworth heads the Council of the Americas in Washington. Previously he served in the White House, State Department, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. 

     Latin America just suffered a lost decade. Again. And now, after an initial post-Covid burst, economies have slowed and projections for future growth remain sluggish. Exasperated voters are demanding change, both in the streets and the voting booths, punishing leaders unwilling or unable to deliver the improving quality of life they have repeatedly promised but never quite delivered. Election after election, when offered the chance, voters are selecting untried, nontraditional leaders -- sometimes even risky political outsiders -- who promise big results and easy solutions. 

     Hand wringing in Washington about a leftward lurch, or the counternarrative of an anti-incumbency wave, both miss the point. Rather, the new crop of leaders is defined by a common desire to increase state-led economic and social intervention, in some cases without a moderating political give and take or adherence to democratic niceties. 

     Leaders don't actually articulate the vision this way, of course. They talk about fairness and reducing inequality and increasing individual rights (but not property rights) and strengthening favored constituencies and sectors of the economy. Several of these are appropriate, even necessary, ambitions. Latin America, after all, really does have the world's worst income inequality profile, which shamefully persists. Indigenous rights have routinely been trampled. Quality education and true economic opportunity are not widely shared. 

     To make matters substantially worse, the Covid pandemic both deepened and highlighted regional inefficiencies and inequalities, making them unavoidable to all but those wearing blinkers, forcing the current political reckoning. Citizens are now, understandingly, seeking solutions. In Chile, that means efforts to rewrite the constitution and social contract. In Colombia, income redistribution and rural development are high priorities of the new government, as well as greater control of the energy and mining sectors. In El Salvador, it's a radical effort by the president to bring gangs under control. In Mexico, even before the pandemic began, the president embarked on a classic strategy of state-led development, including unnecessary and inefficient infrastructure projects, a recapture of the heretofore liberalized energy sector, and the militarization and recentralization of the security forces. In Brazil, when the two leading candidates for the October presidential elections aren't comparing each other to Satan, they are attempting to outcompete each other on populist promises. 

     While seemingly unrelated, what these priorities all have in common is that, if fully implemented, they would dramatically increase the role of the state in each respective economy. And they are popular. But the path to get there is fraught with politics, personal ambition, and untrained officials, exacerbated by judiciaries that may lack impartiality. 

     Success relies on qualified, public-spirited, uncorrupted officials to put public rather than private interests first. To put it diplomatically, such a scenario has not always been in evidence across the region. As a result, an expanded state role is often more likely to exacerbate pre-existing economic and social problems rather than to improve them. Scarce resources are inefficiently allocated as the weight of the state is placed on the scales of normal political and economic discourse. Private interests work to capture greater rents rather than innovating and investing according to economic signals, seeking favorable tax and regulatory treatment, contracts, and market protections while squeezing out competition, squelching entrepreneurialism, and harming consumers. History shows that growing authoritarianism and corruption generally follow unless counterbalancing institutions including the judiciary, legislature, and the press remain vibrant and independent. 

     In fact, despite recent political diagnoses, Latin America's economic problems are not the result of too little state involvement in economies, but rather too much. The idea of the ""lost decade"" was first coined in the 1980s to describe a persistent lack of regional growth engendered by sclerotic economies and over-centralization. It midwifed an urgent effort to institute democratic governance, relatively orthodox economic management including opening markets, and a conscious effort to limit the heavy hand of the state in economic affairs leading to a more efficient and fairer distribution of rents. Growth returned and poverty decreased as high inflation retreated, currencies stabilized, and investment increased. Business cycles continued, but wild swings appeared to be in the past, making longer-term planning possible. 

     But the reform effort was short-circuited by the commodities super cycle earlier this century, driven by China, that flooded the region with easy money. It masked the deep economic and social imbalances that continued to persist while reducing incentives for leaders to adhere to previous policy commitments. Growth was real but ephemeral, as resources were squandered on current spending, giveaways to favored groups, and corruption rather than strategic investment or the creation of space for needed reforms. Special interests weakened reforms. 

     Leaders benefited handsomely until the money ran out. When it did, a new wave of leaders beginning in 2015 was elected to clean up the mess, but they had limited resources to work with after the excesses of their predecessors. Indeed, some were themselves corrupted, further reducing public trust and increasing the attractiveness of outsider candidates. The region now faces higher debt loads, increasing inflation and interest rates, and continued pandemic overhang, in large measure with leaders who lack the benefit of traditional political experience and who may not feel bound by democratic best practices. Meanwhile, the United States continues to lose standing across the hemisphere by exhibiting scant interest in regional trade expansion or meaningful economic engagement including debt relief. The temptation to turn to China for relief is real, despite the many political, security, and economic drawbacks of closer association with Beijing. 

     Ultimately, the best way to unlock broad based, sustainable economic development across the region is to reduce, rather than expand, the levers of state influence and control. Attracting and keeping constructive capital, both domestic and foreign, is the key. A sense of urgency is critical as the world looks for greater supply chain efficiencies stemming from the Covid pandemic, Russia's assault on Ukraine, and potential instability in the South China Sea. 

     Desirable actions are as prosaic as they are powerful. Reduction of burdensome, ineffective, and obsolete regulations including restrictive labor codes. Market-led infrastructure development. True commitment to broad based education and health sectors reform. Active steps toward trade liberalization. Privatization of state assets. Improved citizen security and rule of law. 

     None of these are secrets or magic bullets. But all are required for Latin America to achieve its highest potential. And each of these is within the capacity and competence of states to achieve. It's when governments overstretch, as they have done since colonial days and are tempted to do again, that problems deepen. 

     Equality of opportunity has never really existed across most of Latin America. It is now central to voters' demands. Governments must begin to pay attention. We will know that they are when, instead of working to expand their own influence and authority, they work assiduously to create a level, transparent playing field for their citizens and then back intentionally away. It may be the triumph of hope over experience, to quote Samuel Johnson, but the high chances of future lost decades suggest it's time to try.

CEO comments 
 
Organic growth and strengthened position in northern Europe 
 
MEKO stands strong and is reporting positive organic growth for the 
Group as a whole, despite changes in market conditions and turbulence in 
our business environment. It is also very satisfying that, during the 
quarter, we took an important step and strengthened our position through 
the acquisition of Koivunen, affording us a market-leading position in 
Finland and Estonia. The acquisition also expands our operations to 
Latvia and Lithuania. At the same time, generally rising inflation has 
created a cautious trend in several of our markets, which, combined with 
unfavorable currency fluctuations, impacted our profitability during the 
quarter. We now put full focus on using our insights, by acting 
decisively and methodically to ensure continued profitable growth. 
 
Acquisition of Koivunen - a key step 
For many years, MEKO has had a successful strategy for creating value 
through carefully selected acquisitions. On July 1 when Koivunen became 
a part of MEKO, we have established ourselves as the leading player in 
Finland, where we previously had limited operations, and in Estonia, 
where we were not represented at all. The acquisition also expands our 
operations to Latvia and Lithuania. The company had 1,740 MSEK in net 
sales and an EBIT margin of 5.6 percent in 2021. The distribution 
channels include concept-affiliated and independent workshops 
anddistributors, industrial customers and export. Koivunen is a 
prosperous company with strong brands that will continue to be developed 
in their existing form as a separate business area. This important step 
eastward means that we are closing in on our goal of becoming the best 
and most comprehensive partner for everyone that services and maintains 
vehicles in Northern Europe. 
 
Cautious trend in several markets while Poland reports strong growth 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a humanitarian crisis with 
many other knock-on effects, such as challenges related to sourcing of 
materials and increased prices, combined with currency fluctuations and 
rising inflation. This, combined with high energy and fuel prices, 
resulted in reduced consumer purchasing power and, consequently as 
cautious trend in several of our markets during the quarter. The 
Norwegian and, to a certain extent, the Danish market were affected to a 
greater extent. For the Group as a whole, net sales increased by 5 
percent to SEK 3,357 M (3,210) during the second quarter, which is 
confirmation of the stability of our underlying business. Organic growth 
amounted to slightly more than 2 percent, with Inter-Team in Poland 
standing out in a positive sense with its organic growth of more than 8 
percent. 
 
Currency fluctuations and cost increases impacted profitability 
Profitability for the second quarter was impacted by the changes in the 
market. EBIT amounted to SEK 185 M (280) and the EBIT margin to 5 
percent (9). A total of SEK -26 M (-) in items affecting comparability 
related to the acquisition of Koivunen was charged to earnings for the 
quarter. Adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 240 M (314) and the adjusted EBIT 
margin to 7 percent (10). The gross margin rose to 46.3 percent (45.5), 
largely thanks to previously implemented price adjustments. The change 
in earnings compared with the corresponding quarter of the preceding 
year was due in full to cost increases resulting from generally higher 
inflationary pressure combined with unfavorable currency fluctuations. 
The situation is being managed resolutely and methodically, and we are 
drawing on our tried-and-tested ability to transform. We launched 
several targeted activities in various parts of the operations to reduce 
our cost base and secure long-term profitable growth. Our flexibility, 
together with our underlying stable business, makes me confident that 
the efforts are having the intended effect. 
 
Solid financial position enables accessibility and continued growth 
Our financial position remains solid. After the end of the quarter, we 
signed a new credit facility agreement of SEK 1,965 M, which replaces 
earlier financing of EUR 178 M. This provides us with both flexibility 
and strong resilience. Net debt amounted to SEK 2,649 M (2,549) at the 
end of the second quarter and net debt/EBITDA excluding effects of IFRS 
16 amounted to 2.4 times (2.0), which is in the lower end of our target 
range. Cash flow from operating activities was positive during the 
quarter and amounted to SEK 387 M (406). We can see major opportunities 
to increase sales and market shares going forward through responsible 
investment in increased availability for our customers. Our strategic 
decision to strengthen our stocks of attractive components and spare 
parts stands firm and we are now at approximately the same levels as at 
the close of the first quarter. 
 
Well equipped to continue our journey 
I can confirm that we have a fundamentally stable business and that we 
have demonstrated that we can manage difficulties and challenging market 
conditions. Today, MEKO has many established brands, covering various 
wishes and needs, which together with our proven ability to balance our 
cost base and extract synergies, will enable continued long-term, 
sustainable growth and profitability. We stand well equipped to now 
further strengthen our position in all of our markets through 
transformation toward an even more sustainable and profitable company. 
We aim to be the best and most complete partner for everyone that 
services and maintains vehicles in our markets - today and in the 
future.

459,"Treasury Yields Edge Higher Ahead of Jackson Hole Fed Conference -- WSJ

  By Matt Grossman 

 

  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose for a fourth straight session on Wednesday as traders leaned further into bets that persistent inflation could send the Fed's target interest rate higher for longer. 

  Just before the bond market's 3 p.m. settlement, the 10-year was yielding around 3.111%, up from 3.053% on Tuesday. The yield on the two-year note--even more sensitive to near-term Fed policy expectations--was at 3.367%, up from 3.304% a day earlier. 

  In another show of caution around future Fed moves, investors' demand for fresh five-year notes was relatively weak in Wednesday's Treasury auction that offered $45 billion of debt. As traders await Friday remarks from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a Jackson, Wyo. Fed conference, auction pricing was some of the weakest, relative to pre-auction levels, since May 2020, Jeffries analysts noted. 

  ""Investors appear to be reluctant to buy the belly ahead of Friday's Jackson Hole speeches which will likely argue for a higher terminal rate, "" Jeffries wrote, referring to intermediate-term debt.

460,"Bonds Rally on Encouraging Inflation Data -- WSJ

  By Sam Goldfarb 

 

     U.S. stocks and government bonds rallied Wednesday after new data raised investors' hopes that the pandemic era's stubbornly high inflation might finally be easing. 

     The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6%, the S&P 500 added 2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7%. 

     Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, slid after the Labor Department said that overall consumer prices were roughly unchanged in July from the previous month and that core prices, excluding volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.3% from June. 

     Tracker: How Prices Changed in July 

     Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.2% increase in overall prices and a 0.5% increase in core prices. 

     The better-than-expected data caused investors to immediately bet that the Federal Reserve won't have to raise short-term interest rates as high -- or at least as fast -- as they had previously anticipated. That in turn pulled down Treasury yields, which largely reflect the expected path of short-term rates. 

     In recent trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was 2.756%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 2.797% Tuesday. 

     The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to changes in the near-term interest rate outlook, dropped to 3.132% from 3.284% Tuesday. 

     Blake Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said after the report that it is still ""way too early"" for the Fed, or investors, to declare victory over inflation. Still, he said, ""the softer print takes some of the pressure"" off the Fed to raise rates by another 0.75 percentage point in September and sets the stage for a more robust debate among officials about the proper way forward. 

     Even before Wednesday's data, longer-term Treasury yields in particular had come a long way off of their highs reached in mid-June, when the 10-year yield nearly touched 3.5%. 

     After ratcheting up their interest-rate expectations for most of the year, investors in recent weeks have started betting more heavily that the U.S. economy will soon enter a recession -- if it isn't in one already -- forcing the Fed to eventually start cutting interest rates in order to stimulate growth. 

     The trend toward lower yields was interrupted on Friday when investors were confronted with a surprisingly strong jobs report. But longer-term yields had already started to edge down again earlier this week. 

     Wednesday's rally in bonds was particularly evident among shorter-term Treasurys. 

     The 10-year yield initially fell as low as 2.673% after the inflation report but then retraced a large portion of that decline. 

     That reversal reflected a basic calculation among investors that what the Fed does in the near term could alter its course over the longer term, analysts said. 

     Many investors believe that if the Fed raises rates aggressively now, it is more likely to cause a severe recession that would lead to more rate cuts later. As a result, shorter-term yields have climbed above longer-term yields -- a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve that has often been a harbinger of recessions. 

     Wednesday's move, though, made the yield curve slightly less inverted, reflecting bets that the Fed might have a better chance of avoiding a damaging economic slowdown.

462,"One Upside to High Inflation: Lower Tax Bills -- WSJ

  By Ashlea Ebeling 

 

     One of the few benefits of high inflation may be a tax cut for millions of Americans.Many workers will get bigger paychecks in January and be able to stash more money in their retirement accounts when the Internal Revenue Service makes its annual inflation adjustments to dozens of tax provisions. Normally these are minimal modifications, but given August's persistently high inflation data, tax experts estimate a significant impact on 2023 taxes.More of Americans' income will be taxed at lower rates next year, when the thresholds for income-tax brackets and the standard deduction are raised, thanks to automatic inflation adjustments built into the tax code, tax professionals say. A single taxpayer with $100,000 of adjusted gross income in 2023, could see a tax savings of about $500 compared to someone with the same income this year, according to Jim Young, an accounting professor at Northern Illinois University.Estate- and gift-tax thresholds are expected to go up, too, allowing a couple to shelter nearly $2 million more from these taxes. And the contribution limits will likely be raised for retirement plans, meaning more tax-advantaged savings.""Over the last decade, inflation has been moderate, so we only saw minor increases in tax parameters each year,"" said Kyle Pomerleau, a federal tax policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ""This year, we will see a much larger adjustment as prices have risen much faster.""The IRS makes the adjustments based on formulas set out in federal law that are somewhat different from headline inflation numbers. The Labor Department on Tuesday reported its consumer-price index was 8.3% higher in August than the same month a year ago.The tax-provision adjustments are tied to an alternate inflation measure called the chained consumer-price index, which takes into account the substitutions shoppers make as costs rise. The average of the chained CPI from September 2021 to August 2022 is used to calculate the 2023 adjustments, which the IRS will announce in October or November. These ultimately affect tax returns for the 2023 tax year filed in early 2024.""Adjusting tax-return data for inflation was a purposeful decision by Congress intended to shield taxpayers from annual inflation,"" said Mr. Young. ""This will hopefully help taxpayers cope with rising prices."" The benefits of these changes could be offset by inflation in other ways. If your wages have gone up, your total tax bill may not go down, Mr. Young said.Here are the estimates, for the IRS adjustments, according to the American Enterprise Institute:The threshold for the top federal income-tax bracket in 2023 is expected to climb by nearly $50,000 next year for married couples, and that 37% rate will apply to income above $693,750. For individuals, that top tax bracket will start at $578,125.Those levels and the other tax-bracket break points will all rise about 7% from tax year 2022, compared with about 3% last year, which was the largest increase in four years. This year's increase is the largest in the past 35 years, said Mr. Young.The Social Security wage base tax level is estimated to increase 5.5% from $147,000 to $155,100 in 2023, according to the 2022 Social Security Trustees Report.The standard deduction for married couples is expected to be $27,700 for 2023, up from $25,900 this year, and $13,850 for individuals, up from $12,950. This is the amount those who don't itemize deductions on their returns can subtract from their total earnings subject to income taxes.The federal estate-tax exclusion amount, what an individual can shelter from estate taxes, is $12.06 million this year. It is expected to increase to $12.92 million for 2023, meaning a married couple could shelter nearly $26 million from estate tax with little planning.The annual limit on tax-free gifts is expected to climb from $16,000 this year to $17,000 for 2023. The taxpayers who benefit from this are high-wealth individuals, said Mr. Young. They can give away more without estate- or gift-tax consequences.The maximum contribution amount for an individual retirement account is expected to jump to $6,500 for 2023, up from $6,000, where it has been stuck since 2019. The maximum contribution allowed for a healthcare flexible spending account is expected to increase to $3,050 in 2023, up from $2,850 this year. The maximum contribution amount for a 401(k) or similar workplace retirement plan is governed by yet another formula, using inflation data through September. Actuaries at Milliman, a benefits firm, estimate that the contribution limit will rise from $20,500 this year to $22,500 in 2023, and the catch-up amount for workers aged 50-plus will rise from $6,500 to at least $7,500.The child tax credit is even more complicated. Under current law, the total tax credit of $2,000 per child isn't adjusted for inflation, Mr. Pomerleau said. But the additional child tax credit that is refundable and available even to taxpayers who have no tax liability, is adjusted for inflation. It is expected to rise from $1,500 to $1,600 in 2023. The income limits related to the CTC aren't adjusted for inflation.Write to Ashlea Ebeling at ashlea.ebeling@wsj.com

464,"Stocks Fall, Bond Yields Scale New Multiyear Highs Ahead of Fed -- WSJ

  By Joe Wallace and Matt Grossman 

 

     U.S. stock indexes fell and Treasury yields rose to fresh multiyear highs Tuesday on expectations the Federal Reserve will continue its forceful monetary tightening to curb inflation. 

     The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials both lost 0.8% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite declined 0.3%. 

     Government bond prices kept falling, pushing yields higher. Ten-year Treasury yields rose to 3.569% from 3.489% Monday, which was the highest closing level since April 2011. Yields on two-year notes, which are sensitive to the interest-rate outlook, rose to 3.969% from 3.946% Monday, the highest end-of-day level since 2007. 

     All eyes are on the Fed, which is beginning a two-day policy meeting. At the end of the gathering Wednesday, the central bank is expected to raise its interest-rate target by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3% to 3.25%. Traders in fed-fund futures put a roughly 20% probability on a full percentage-point increase. 

     Higher rates have pummeled markets in 2022, putting stock and bond prices into reverse after a multiyear run-up driven in part by low interest rates. Many investors are concerned that tighter central-bank policy, together with disruptions stemming from Chinese Covid-19 lockdowns and the war in Ukraine, will push the U.S. economy into a recession next year. 

     Stock losses were broad into Tuesday afternoon, hitting all 11 S&P sectors. Ford shares dropped 10% a day after the auto maker warned that parts shortages and higher costs will hit earnings. Gap fell 2.2%. The Wall Street Journal reported that the apparel retailer will trim about 500 corporate jobs to cut costs. 

     Casino operators were among the few stocks that notched gains on signs that loosening Covid-19 restrictions could improve tourism in Macau, an Asian gambling mecca. Wynn Resorts rose 5% and Las Vegas Sands gained 3.3%. 

     Fed officials have made clear they are willing to accept a recession if it is the price of slowing the pace of inflation. Data last week showed inflation remained strong, cementing expectations the central bank will keep raising rates. 

     ""Markets remain convinced that the Fed would continue to act in a one-way fashion to any sort of inflation surprise,"" said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. 

     The rise in yields has picked up pace in part because investors burned by previous climbs in yields have grown less willing to step in and buy Treasurys, he said, adding that money managers have lost confidence in where yields might peak. The Fed ""has over the last few months reinforced just how much focus it has on short-term inflation,"" Mr. Roe said. 

     The surge in Treasury yields was echoed in foreign-government bonds as other major central banks step up their own efforts to control rising prices. 

     Sweden's Riksbank on Tuesday raised its benchmark rate by a full percentage point and signaled that it would end asset purchases by the end of the year to remove another leg of monetary stimulus. The Bank of England is expected to raise rates Thursday, following a similar move by the European Central Bank in early September. 

     ""What we're seeing from global central banks is a recognition that inflation is a more difficult issue for them to tackle than they may have thought a month ago or a year ago,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup. 

     Overseas stocks were mixed. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.1%, but in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 0.4% higher and the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2%. 

     Oil prices edged down, with Brent-crude futures trading falling 2% to trade at $90.15 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency's value against a basket of foreign money, ticked higher to 110.01, adding to the greenback's significant year-to-date gains.

  Goldman Sachs Plans to Cut Hundreds of Jobs 

  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is preparing to lay off hundreds of staffers as soon as next week. 

  The job cuts are part of the bank's annual performance reviews that had been suspended during the pandemic, according to a person familiar with the matter. Goldman reinstated those reviews earlier this year following a slump in Wall Street deal-making activity. Goldman had 47,000 employees on staff at the end of June, up from 41,000 a year earlier. 

  The New York Times earlier reported on the impending layoffs. 

  Freight Railroads Propose Limiting Sensitive Cargo as Strike Threat Looms 

  Freight railroads said they are planning to halt the transport of hazardous materials and sensitive cargoes, such as chemicals used in fertilizer and chlorine for water purification, as they continue negotiations with two labor unions. 

  Railroads have informed customers that they may stop accepting certain types of freight, including bulk shipments, beginning Monday to avoid materials being unattended or unsecured in case of a work stoppage. 

  The railroads have already reached new labor deals or are completing tentative agreements with 10 unions, and are in continuing talks with two groups representing about 66,000 workers. The two remaining unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and SMART-Transportation Division, said Sunday that the railroads' plans to restrict cargo is a move to ""extort a contract settlement"" and that they remain at the bargaining table.

  Wells Fargo & Co. agreed to pay about $145 million to resolve U.S. Labor Department allegations that the bank's retirement plan overpaid for its own stock. 

  The Labor Department found that the bank's 401(k) plan and its trustee paid between $1,033 and $1,090 per share for preferred stock, which later converted to $1,000 in common stock when it was allocated to plan participants, the government agency said Monday. 

  Wells Fargo and GreatBanc Trust Co., the trustee, also used the dividends paid on the preferred shares to repay stock-purchase loans, thereby offsetting their own obligations to contribute to the 401(k) plan, the Labor Department said. 

  GE Chief Says Supply Chain Is a Daily Challenge

Mr. Culp will be nonexecutive chairman of the new board, and GE Healthcare CEO Peter Arduini will also be a director. The Boston conglomerate plans to split into three separate public companies over the next two years while it navigates the pandemic's impact on its aviation business and supply-chain problems. 

  ""Supply chains, broadly defined, are still challenging,"" Mr. Culp said in an interview Monday, highlighting challenges at both the aerospace and healthcare divisions. ""You might have success here. You might make progress there, but I don't think we're anywhere close to declaring victory."" 

  NY Fed Says Consumers Saw in August Steep Declines in Future Inflation 

  American consumers said in August that they are expecting notable declines in future levels of inflation, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Monday. 

  The bank said in its August Survey of Consumer Expectations that one year from now, households see inflation at 5.7%, down from the 6.2% they predicted in the July survey. Three years from now, survey respondents expect to see inflation at 2.8%, down from the 3.2% seen in July. 

  The expected level of inflation over the longer run also eased. The report said five years from now, survey respondents see inflation at 2% as of August, down from July's 2.3% forecast. In July, inflation was up by 6.3% from the same month a year ago, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index.

  Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is betting the social-media giant's near-term future on Instagram Reels, the short-video feature he is touting as the company's answer to TikTok. 

  The company's internal research shows that Meta has a lot of catching up to do. 

  Instagram users cumulatively are spending 17.6 million hours a day watching Reels, less than one-tenth of the 197.8 million hours TikTok users spend each day on that platform, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that summarizes internal Meta research. 

  California Offshore Wind Projects Face Hurdles as Pressure Groups, Industry Interests Weigh In 

  WASHINGTON-As the Biden administration plans for the country's first West Coast offshore wind turbines, interests ranging from commercial fishing fleets to powerful environmental groups are complicating the road ahead for the California projects. 

  The Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management expects to hold a lease sale for two offshore regions by the end of the year, one north of Santa Barbara near Morro Bay and another more remote site off Humboldt County just south of the Oregon border. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said the state ""is home to one of the world's best offshore wind resources in the world."" 

  The floating turbines in both regions would likely be more than 20 miles offshore, making them hard to see from the coast and resolving the common complaint that turbines are an eyesore. Together, the projects are aimed at augmenting California's power supply, generating enough to run more than 1.5 million homes with more than 4.5 gigawatts of electricity, U.S. officials estimate. That input could help the state reach its goal of 100% zero-emission power sources by 2045. 

   
 
 

  TALKING POINTS A Bad Year for Crypto Is a Really Bad One for Crypto Miners By Caitlin Ostroff and Vicky Ge Huang 

  Last year was harvest time for crypto miners. Now, they're getting hit on all sides. 

  Crypto prices are plunging. Miners' electricity bills are surging. Practically no one wants to buy their equipment. 

  It is a sharp turnaround from 2021, when crypto prices were soaring and many mining firms went on a mostly debt-funded buying spree of mining machines. But this year, crypto prices have been dropping and major crypto projects and companies have been wiped out. That has reduced the profits that miners can make from harvesting digital coins-and from selling their equipment in a pinch. 

  Meanwhile, prices for electricity-needed to keep the miners' powerful computers running-are soaring. Russia's war with Ukraine has hamstrung global energy supplies, while an extreme heat wave has bolstered energy demand from families that need to cool their homes. 

  Shares of crypto miners Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., Riot Blockchain Inc. and Core Scientific Inc. are all down 55% or more this year. 

  ""I don't think we are at the max pain yet in mining,"" said Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital. 

  Bitcoin miners set up and run the powerful computers that process bitcoin transactions. Those computers generate random numbers in hopes of finding the right combination to unlock formulas; the first to do so are rewarded with newly created bitcoins. 

  This makes it most profitable to mine bitcoin when the cryptocurrency's value is rising. Near bitcoin's 2021 peak, miners earned more than $60 million a day, according to data from Blockchain.com. Now, that number is around $19 million a day.

466,"Japan Jumps Into Market to Buy Yen for First Time in 24 Years; Currency Rallies -- Update

  By Megumi Fujikawa 

 

     TOKYO -- Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market by buying yen for the first time in 24 years, shortly after the Bank of Japan accelerated a fall in the currency by confirming it would maintain ultralow interest rates. 

     The rare intervention was the latest example of global concern triggered by the strong dollar, which has gained ground on the back of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases. 

     One nation hit by the fallout is Japan, the world's third-largest economy, which has to pay more for essential imports of oil, natural gas and food. These imports are generally denominated in dollars and now are costing more in yen terms. 

     The dollar rose near 146 yen after Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda hinted Thursday afternoon that interest rates in the country were likely to stay near zero for the next couple of years. 

     Less than an hour after Mr. Kuroda stopped talking, the government stepped in. It said it intervened in the market to sell dollars and buy yen -- the first such operation since 1998. 

     The move resulted in an initial success. Within minutes, the yen rose so that it took only around 141 yen to buy a dollar. Still, that is far below a level set earlier this year when the dollar was trading at around 115 yen. As of Thursday evening Tokyo time, the yen was trading at around 142.65 yen to the dollar. 

     The core cause of the dollar's strength, particularly against the yen, is the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and Japan, traders have said. 

     On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point and signaled additional large increases to come. A half-day later in Japan on Thursday, the central bank decided to maintain short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and its target for the 10-year Japanese government bond yield at around zero. 

     Mr. Kuroda said the bank had no plan to raise interest rates and repeated the bank's guidance that it would maintain easy monetary policy for the time being, which he defined as two to three years. The reason, he said, was that he didn't see Japan's inflation -- which hit 3% in August -- as likely to last. 

     ""It is almost certain that the pace of price increases will fall below 2% next fiscal year and beyond,"" Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference on Thursday. The next fiscal year in Japan begins in April 2023. Inflation in Japan is much milder than in the U.S., where prices have been rising at a pace exceeding 8%. 

     Mr. Kuroda said the yen's recent fall is ""one-sided and affected by speculative trading"" but reiterated that the bank would continue monetary easing because he said the nation's economy was still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. 

     In recent months, traders have generally brushed off statements by Japanese officials expressing concern about the yen's fall, assuming Tokyo wasn't ready to put its money where its mouth was. That could change now, analysts said. 

     ""Speculative traders may become more cautious over verbal intervention, thinking that any comments by the finance minister could mean something, "" said Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities strategist Naomi Muguruma. 

     ""But the effects could be temporary as long as fundamental factors behind a weak yen remain, such as Japan's trade deficit and an interest-rate gap between Japan and abroad,"" Ms. Muguruma said.

467,"Capital Journal Special Edition: How Economic Concerns Are Shaping the Midterm Elections

  Welcome to a special edition of WSJ's politics newsletter looking at the impact of recent economic developments on the November midterm elections. To receive our weekday edition and future special editions, sign up here. 

  By Miguel Gonzalez 

  Catch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions. Sign up for What's News , free in your inbox on weekday evenings and Sunday afternoons.  Three Questions for WSJ's John McCormick 

  WSJ: What economic issues are voters watching most closely? 

  John McCormick: With most workers feeling relatively secure in their jobs because of the tight labor market, inflation has been the dominant economic issue for voters this entire year. It's something many younger voters have never dealt with before, or at least not at these levels that represent the highest inflation in four decades. Economists and pollsters say Americans feel it at a very personal level because rising prices are noticeable at almost every turn in their daily lives. For those on fixed incomes, like some seniors, it can be especially painful. And just a quick reminder on that slice of the electorate: those 65 and older typically vote at higher rates than everyone else. In the 2018 midterm election, 66.1% of seniors cast ballots, compared with a national average of 53.4% for the voting-age population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. 

  WSJ: You wrote about the political impact of inflation in March, finding that voters were losing patience then with rising prices. Have economic developments since then-with fuel prices easing but many consumer prices still elevated-likely shifted voters' views? 

  John McCormick: Asking voters how they're feeling about inflation was relatively new back then. We reported the story from the Phoenix area because it was recording the nation's biggest inflationary increases among the largest metropolitan areas, a dubious distinction it's continued to hold for much of 2022. Inflation hasn't gotten better in any significant way since then, although lower gasoline prices have helped ease some pain for those who drive a lot. I watch a lot of political ads-probably not the healthiest thing to do-and images of gas pumps and grocery-store aisles have dominated this year's Republican messaging. So, even if voters are feeling a little better because of lower pump prices, they're constantly being reminded about what feels like a hole in their pocketbooks. 

  WSJ: Are voters in some parts of the country more likely to make their decisions based on economic concerns than on social issues that have surfaced ahead of the election? 

  John McCormick: That's difficult to answer. The Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion and returned the issue to the states is certainly motivating some voters and Democrats have made abortion access an issue to try to counteract what polling shows is a perceived weakness on their handling of the economy. One thing we know is that inflation isn't the same everywhere. The national number -up 8.3% in August compared with a year ago-gets most of the attention. But food and fuel prices vary significantly across the nation and inflation will likely be a bigger issue in some congressional races than in others. In Nevada, host to one of the most competitive Senate races, gas prices are still averaging around $5.50 a gallon. In Pennsylvania, where there's another top Senate contest, they're below $4 a gallon on average. Few things are certain in politics, but I'd guess we'll see more ads featuring gas pumps in Nevada than Pennsylvania in the home stretch. 

  John McCormick is a national political reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Write to him at [mccormick.john@wsj.com]. 

  The Wall Street Journal is tracking the impact that inflation and rising interest rates are having on the economy ahead of the November elections. Here is a closer look at some of the issues. Voters have cited a range of issues likely to motivate them at the polls, including abortion, border security and gun violence, and in the weeks ahead we will examine some of those. 

   The jobs market continued its gradual cooling in September as high inflation and rising interest rates weighed on the economy. 

  U.S. employers added 263,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said Friday, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% from 3.7% in August, matching a half-century low that was last reached in July. The report keeps the Federal Reserve on track to approve another large interest-rate increase at its meeting next month as officials seek to lift borrowing costs high enough to soften the labor market and ease inflation pressures.  Fears of a recession aren't keeping employers burned during the pandemic from hoarding staff now. 

  Some large companies, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wayfair Inc. and Snap Inc., have recently announced or signaled layoffs, but they are outnumbered by companies saying that labor shortages are crimping sales and production, reports Sarah Chaney Cambon. 

   U.S. consumers are digging deeper into their wallets to cover rising costs of essentials. 

  Household spending rose 0.4% in August after dropping a revised 0.2% in July, according to the Commerce Department, but the August rise was just 0.1% after accounting for inflation, reports Harriet Torry. The Labor Department is set to release the September consumer-price report on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. 

   There are signs that inflation, already close to a four-decade high, has become increasingly entrenched. 

  Overall inflation slowed in August, measured by the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, but underlying price pressures strengthened during the month, reports Gwynn Guilford. Consumer prices rose 6.2% in August from a year earlier, easing from a revised 6.4% in July, as measured by the Commerce Department's personal-consumption expenditures price index. 

   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will stop at nothing to bring down inflation-even if his campaign prompts a recession. 

  During the pandemic's early days, Mr. Powell had followed the model that former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke set in the 2008 financial crisis, enacting policies to avoid market meltdowns. But with prices holding at elevated levels, Mr. Powell is using an aggressive playbook drawn up by former Fed chief Paul Volcker, reports Nick Timiraos. 

  A United Nations agency said last week that the Fed and other central banks risked pushing the global economy into recession followed by prolonged stagnation if they kept raising interest rates. Some economists fear the central banks might go too far if they don't take into account their collective impact on global demand.

468,"Treasury Overloaded With I Bond Orders -- 3rd Update

  By Veronica Dagher 

 

     Oct. 28 is investors' last chance to buy I Bonds that earn a 9.62% interest rate. Yet a surge in demand for the inflation-adjusted bonds has overwhelmed the TreasuryDirect site and the Treasury Department said it cannot guarantee orders will be completed in time. 

     Many investors managed to beat the clock and the tech issues. As of 12 p.m. ET, about 52,000 accounts had been created and more than $500 million in I Bond purchased on Friday alone, Treasury said. Thursday, about 82,000 accounts were created totaling roughly $750 million in I Bond sales. That brings this week's I Bonds sales to about $3.2 billion so far, Treasury said. 

     Michael Erat and his wife, Linda Erat, were among the thousands of people who had success. 

     After eight hours of wrestling with the TreasuryDirect website, Mr. Erat purchased his $10,000 I Bond allotment. 

     ""It was an eight-hour struggle,"" said Mr. Erat, who lives in northeast Pennsylvania. 

     Mrs. Erat managed to make the purchase in about half the time of her husband. 

     Others have still not been able to access the TreasuryDirect site or log on to their account to buy I Bonds. 

     Safe, staid inflation-adjusted Series I savings bonds don't capture much of the investing spotlight in most years. They became breakout stars of 2022 as inflation reached a four-decade high, markets plunged, and investors searched for a safe place to park their money. 

     As the deadline to get the 9.62% rate approached this week, the government's TreasuryDirect site, the only place investors can directly purchase I Bonds, became one of the most visited federal websites, officials said, and has experienced intermittent outages for several days this week. 

     Still, many investors continue to run into difficulties accessing and logging on to the site. 

     Todd Miller, who lives in Camarillo, Calif., hasn't been able to unlock his TreasuryDirect account. He has been trying for several days to get assistance, calling the site's help number and waiting over two hours. He was told Friday by a customer service representative that due to system outages, he wouldn't be able to get his account unlocked in time to snag the 9.62% I Bond rate. 

     ""I think the government should extend the deadline on this sale,"" said Mr. Miller. 

     ""We have tripled TreasuryDirect's capacity in the last day and continue to see customers successfully create accounts and purchase bonds at record levels. Any additional updates to TreasuryDirect during the final days of the rate window, such as a delay to the Nov. 1 rate change, would pose significant risk to the operational integrity of the system,"" said a Treasury spokesman. 

     ""Due to unprecedented requests for new accounts, we can't guarantee customers will be able to complete a purchase at the current 9.62% rate by the Oct. 28 deadline. The TreasuryDirect system has been and continues to process the payments that have been completed,"" a spokesman said. 

     If a customer receives a confirmation that their purchase has been made or completed by Oct. 28 11:59:59 p.m. ET, then the payment will be processed, a spokesman said. 

     Users regularly take to social media to complain about the TreasuryDirect website and sometimes go to great lengths to make their I Bond purchases. 

     ""The TreasuryDirect website isn't known for its user friendliness,"" said Elliot Pepper, a financial planner in Baltimore. 

     It isn't just people trying to buy I Bonds who are frustrated with the site's outages. 

     Investors can't buy or redeem T-Bonds, Treasury notes, or T-bills through TreasuryDirect if they can't access the site or log in due to the high demand.

469,"Brazil&apos;s Central Bank Leaves Key Rate Unchanged at 13.75%

 

  By Jeffrey T. Lewis 

 

  SÃO PAULO--The Central Bank of Brazil left its benchmark lending rate unchanged, but warned again that it is prepared to resume hikes if the country's inflation doesn't keep slowing as expected. 

  The bank's monetary policy committee, known as the Copom, left its key Selic rate at 13.75% for the second consecutive meeting. The committee had raised the rate at 12 meetings in a row before the September conclave, lifting the Selic from a record low of 2%. The Copom said it is ready to raise rates again if the situation changes. 

  ""The committee reinforces that future monetary policy steps can be adjusted and will not hesitate to resume the tightening cycle if the disinflationary process does not proceed as expected,"" the bank said. 

  Brazil's headline inflation rate has slowed in recent months, helped by tax cuts for fuels and certain other products and by lower oil prices. The 12-month rate fell to 7.17% in September, the lowest level since April of last year, after reaching an almost 19-year high of 12.13% in April 2022. 

  But underlying inflation is still a concern. Copom members are right to insist that they are ready to react if inflation heats up again, but with economic growth expected to slow and other central banks raising rates, the expectation is that consumer price increases will continue to moderate, said Pedro Paulo Silveira, chief economist at Nova Futura Investimentos. 

  ""Inflation should continue to fall, but it's still at a high level,"" he said. ""Pressure from oil prices, for example, has diminished and slower economic growth next year should help. But the scenario for next year suggests that the Selic will stay higher for longer until the remaining sources of pressure ease."" 

  Brazil's economy should grow 2.76% this year, with the pace of expansion slowing to 0.63% next year, according to the central bank's weekly survey of economists. Some economic indicators are already showing weaker demand for credit-sensitive items, a sign that the central bank's string of rate increases is having the intended effect.

470,"OPEC+ to Weigh Production Cut to Bolster Oil Prices -- Update

  By Benoit Faucon and Summer Said 

 

     OPEC+ is set to consider Wednesday its most drastic reduction of production since the pandemic began in order to help prop up falling oil prices, a move that could put pressure on global economic growth. 

     The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Moscow-led allies, collectively known as OPEC+, is considering a cut of more than 1 million barrels a day, delegates in the group said. 

     Concerns about a slowing global economy have dragged oil prices down at their fastest pace since the Covid-19 outbreak began in early 2020, prompting OPEC+ to consider ways to prop up the price of oil. Any move by OPEC+ to raise oil prices could put further pressure on Western consumers already hurting from high energy costs while also helping Russia -- one of the biggest energy producers in the world -- fill its state coffers as it wages war against Ukraine. 

     Oil prices had shot up over $100 a barrel and stayed there for months but Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, is now down 23% this quarter, falling to $87.96 a barrel last week, and its swiftest decline since 2020. 

     Falling oil prices are often a pressure-release valve for the global economy, reducing costs as demand falls in a cycle that repeats itself. OPEC+ often holds itself out as a regulator of the oil market, aiming to keep supply and demand balanced, but a production cut would support prices at a time when they are at historically high levels. 

     Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions caused energy prices to soar, raising the price of gasoline in the U.S. and around the world. While prices have started coming down, a cut to production comes amid rising inflation, slowing growth and fears of recession. 

     Adel Hamaizia, a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, said the move could play a role in making recessions worse in some countries. He explained that the production cut could push inflation higher and hurt oil demand further. 

     The U.S. has asked OPEC+ to pump more oil to help bring down the price of gasoline. OPEC+ accelerated some production increases over the summer ahead of President Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia and made a small increase in August but has since worked to reverse those moves. 

     In the past months, the U.S. has responded to rising oil prices by tapping into its strategic stockpiles. Christyan Malek, global head of energy strategy at JP Morgan, said Saudi Arabia's support for a cut to production could partly be a response to the U.S. decision to release stockpiled oil, which has helped lower the price of gas for American consumers. 

     The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

     The production cut could also accelerate the world's changing flows of oil sales since the Ukraine invasion. China, which is seeing slowing economic growth, is turning to Russia for cheaper oil. At the same time, Europe is being forced to buy more expensive oil from Middle Eastern countries since it stopped buying oil from Russia over the Ukraine invasion. 

     Oil prices have been falling in part due to slowing growth in China, which has been hit by persistent Covid-prevention measures. The World Bank has said it expects China's economy to expand 2.8% in 2022, down from a 4.3% forecast in June. 

     Because the ultimate decision about a production cut will be hotly debated, the group decided to meet in person in Vienna on Wednesday for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, the delegates said. Other options being considered include a smaller reduction of 500,000 barrels a day or as much as 1.5 million barrels a day, the delegates said. 

     Russia and Saudi energy ministries didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. 

     The option to cut more than 1 million barrels a day is backed by Russia, the group's biggest non-OPEC partner. 

     A costly war, lower energy prices and a new round of Western sanctions threaten to bear down on Russia's already embattled economy. The country is trying to maximize its windfall from soaring energy prices -- Russia's main economic strength -- after the government's budget reported a deficit due to diminished energy revenue. 

     ""Cuts and higher prices would certainly be at least a short term win for Russia as we approach winter,"" said Mr. Hamaizia. 

     But the cartel's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, has some reservations on the size of the cut, the delegates said. 

     OPEC+ agreed last month to cut oil production for the first time in over a year, saying it would cut about 100,000 barrels a day amid fears of a global recession. 

     The move ended an 18-month era of production increases for OPEC+. The group slowly brought crude back onto the market after a dramatic cut during the pandemic when demand plunged. 

     The Saudis have pursued a more aggressive oil policy this year as oil prices rose during the Ukraine war. Higher oil prices have helped Saudi Arabia become one of the world's fastest-growing economies this year and infused with cash an ambitious economic overhaul launched by the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 

     In one way, an OPEC+ cut won't make much meaningful difference in the day-to-day oil market. The group has been undershooting its targets by more than 3 million barrels a day for much of the year, with Russian production falling and big producers like Nigeria and Angola struggling to invest enough to raise output.

471,"IMF Urges Faster Debt Relief -- WSJ

By Alexander Saeedy 

     Officials from the International Monetary Fund said the governments of poorer countries need better ways to restructure their debt loads totaling billions of dollars to survive a cost-of-living and hunger crisis that is quickly taking root around the world. 

     ""The world has seen extraordinary upheaval,"" Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF's managing director, said Friday, speaking at the closing session of the international financial institution's annual meetings in Washington. 

     With government finances battered by the extraordinary impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and high global inflation, ""More than 60% of low-income countries are in debt distress or near it. An effective debt-resolution mechanism is desperately needed,"" Ms. Georgieva said. 

     Her call to action comes as governments worldwide are reckoning with debt loads not seen in nearly 20 years, a burden that is draining resources when they are needed most. 

     To help support governments, the IMF has launched a one-year program to extend credit to countries struggling to afford high food and energy costs. Fund officials and global policy makers have also suggested that richer countries could reallocate billions of dollars in emergency reserves they received from the IMF during the Covid-19 pandemic to countries facing a budget crunch. 

     However, the IMF urged creditors to do more to help overindebted countries avoid choosing between paying their debts and paying for food. 

     ""Financing resources are scarce, but it is in the nature of trade-offs that policy makers face that food security and nutrition have to be given priority,"" said Vitor Gaspar, director of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, adding that struggling countries ""need to have an orderly debt-restructuring mechanism and forms of debt relief to help put their public finances on a more sustainable path."" 

     One such mechanism for sovereign debt relief, the G-20 Common Framework, has faced a number of criticisms for its shortfalls since launching in 2020. 

     The framework was designed as a one-size-fits-all approach for poorer countries to receive debt relief, and it was meant to improve cooperation among large creditors, including China, which has become the largest lender to the developing world over the past decade. 

     But the framework has produced mixed results for countries that have applied to their creditors for debt relief. Delays by the creditors to reach agreements have held up bailout funds and so far, no country has completed a debt restructuring under the framework. 

     ""We don't yet see other countries knocking on the door of the common framework,"" Ms. Georgieva said in a Wednesday meeting. ""The process is not very predictable."" 

     Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday the G-20's common framework has so far been ""very disappointing,"" blaming China for not fully participating in the effort. 

     ""We've really called on China to step up. The situation is becoming very serious,"" she said. 

     Countries that aren't eligible for common framework debt restructurings are also seeking swift relief from creditors, despite their steadily worsening economic crises. 

     Sri Lanka, which this year became the first government in the Asia-Pacific region to default on its foreign debts since 1999, has struggled to organize its creditors and receive necessary assurances on debt relief that would unlock the IMF's planned $3 billion bailout. 

     China, Sri Lanka's largest creditor, didn't support the country's move to seek an IMF bailout and hasn't agreed to chair a committee that would help coordinate a renegotiation of its debts, according to people familiar with the matter. 

     Overall, the IMF warned that the path out of the global debt overhang won't be easy, as governments tighten their belts when they need to spend more to provide for citizens' basic needs. 

     After decades of reduction, ""extreme poverty has increased in the world, and it is projected to stay well above the pre-pandemic expected path going forward,"" Mr. Gaspar said. ""Emergency support is necessary.""

   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. 

  0947 GMT - Price pressures are becoming even more broad-based in the eurozone, Capital Economics' senior Europe economist Jack Allen-Reynolds says in a note. Nearly 90% of the items in the inflation basket now have an inflation rate above 2%, and more than a quarter have one above 10%, according to the economist. Furthermore, unlike in the U.S. and U.K., core goods inflation doesn't seem to have topped out yet, Allen-Reynolds says. The easing of global supply-chain problems seems likely to bring goods inflation down next year, the economist says. However, Capital Economics suspects that wage growth will accelerate, preventing core inflation from falling sharply. The economic research firm forecasts the eurozone core inflation rate will remain above 2% for the next couple of years. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) 

  0943 GMT - Sterling could return to stability in 2023 as the U.K.'s economic fundamentals improve, Liberum says. ""That is, boosting controls on inflation, cutting public debt and the development of commercial long-term trade relationships,"" Liberum analyst Susana Cruz says in a note. This year sterling was hurt by interest-rate differentials in favor of the dollar, a deterioration of the U.K.'s post-Brexit current account and a spike in fiscal policy uncertainty but the currency should remain a major investment vehicle over the longer term, she says. If sterling does stabilize, companies that will benefit include domestic earners with a high degree of operating leverage such as housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, kitchen supplier Howden Joinery Group and retailer Next, she says. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0926 GMT - Inflation is set to remain elevated in 2023, albeit likely peaking in the first half of next year, says Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse. Inflation is now ""obviously materially too high,"" he says in a webinar. Credit Suisse expects inflation to decline after the anticipated peak in 1H 2023 but not to previous levels, Strobaek says. Credit Suisse sees a return to 2% inflation--that central banks are targeting--as unlikely anytime soon. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0921 GMT - Core bonds will play a more relevant role in bond portfolios in 2023, says Philipp Lisibach, chief global strategist and head of global investment strategy at Credit Suisse, in a webinar. ""Yields have now reached levels that offer some protection against adverse market effects that are likely to occur as we enter a period of substantial economic uncertainty,"" he says in an outlook for next year. The current higher yield levels will allow portfolio diversification benefits to return and contribution from bonds to portfolio returns to start to rise, he says. ""Yields have made a comeback and offer investors an anchor in portfolios,"" Lisibach says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0910 GMT - Investors anticipating central banks to start cutting interest rates in 2023 might be disappointed, Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, says. ""We don't expect central banks to start to cut [interest rates] in 2023,"" he says in a webinar on 2023 outlook. This is very unlikely to happen, he says. Credit Suisse expects central banks to continue to tighten monetary policy in the first half of 2023 with inflation also peaking in 1H before starting to decline. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0841 GMT - Metals markets are mixed, with a lack of macro data points this week to drive prices. Three-month copper is up 0.5% to $7,937.50 a metric ton while aluminum is down 0.2% to $2,375.50 a ton. Meanwhile, gold is 0.3% higher $1,743.90 a troy ounce. ""It is looking increasingly likely the [Federal Reserve] will increase the funds rate by 50 basis points next month compared to the 75 basis-point increases delivered in the past four meetings,"" Joseph Capurso, analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note. A slower rate of hikes would be bullish for risk assets such as metals, as investors steer clear of the dollar. (yusuf.khan@wsj.com) 

  0839 GMT - Fixed-income assets will prove more attractive as monetary-policy tightening likely to slow in 2023, according to Credit Suisse's latest investment outlook. The Swiss bank sees recessions in the eurozone and U.K. and a slump in growth in the U.S. and China in 2023 after a 2022 that saw aggressive rate hikes from central banks and slowing economic growth. But with inflation likely to normalize in 2023, and interest-rate cuts unlikely, fixed-income assets should become more attractive to hold and offer renewed diversification benefits in portfolios, the research says. Long U.S. vs eurozone duration government bonds, emerging-market currency debt and investment-grade credit should offer interesting opportunities in 2023, the outlook says. (edward.frankl@dowjones.com) 

  0820 GMT - News on the Hungarian government's negotiations with the European Commission over the release of EU funding to Hungary may overshadow the National Bank of Hungary's policy decision Tuesday for the forint, ING says. ""From last week's hints, it is likely that we will hear more bad news before any good news comes, which may cause further volatility in the FX market,"" ING analyst Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. ""However, a happy ending to this saga should see the forint below 400 EUR/HUF."" Meanwhile, the NBH's rate decision at 1300 GMT is unlikely to offer any fireworks, Taborsky says. EUR/HUF trades flat at 408.760. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0816 GMT - The dollar's recent downward correction is likely to be limited as the Federal Reserve remains one of the driving forces among central banks in raising interest rates, Commerzbank says. Even if the Fed slows the pace of rate rises, the European Central Bank and other central banks are likely to follow suit, Commerzbank currency analyst Esther Reichelt says in a note. ""Sentiment towards the dollar is only likely to shift on a sustainable basis if we see clearer signs of a recession of the U.S. economy,"" she says.

  0743 GMT - The global economic expansion is expected to slow in 2023 as financial conditions tighten and the upcoming winter aggravates China's Covid-19 outbreaks and Europe's natural gas problems, JPMorgan economists say in a note. The global economy isn't at imminent risk of sliding into recession, as adverse supply-side shocks are fading fast and this is reflected in a slide in global inflation toward3.5% in early 2023, the U.S. bank says. ""We think it is a mistake to rule out a soft-landing scenario (20% probability) in which recession is avoided,"" JPM says. In this scenario, sluggish growth and the removal of supply-side constraints are sufficient to push inflation down toward 2% without a sharp deterioration in labor markets.

  0730 GMT - Germany's 1.30% October 2027 Bobl, which will be reopened for EUR3 billion at auction on Tuesday, is ""rich""--or expensive--on the domestic curve, say Citi's rates strategists in a note. However, this Bobl has cheapened 34 basis points versus swaps over the past six weeks, they add. The October 2027 Bobl is trading at a yield of 1.975%, according to Tradeweb, while the average yield came in at 2.11% at the previous auction on Oct. 25. The upcoming sale will be Germany's last five-year debt auction this year. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0739 GMT - Ethiopia's inflation rate will likely trend lower over the coming months, aided by the arrival of new harvests across one of Africa's top corn and wheat growers, says Oxford Economics Africa. Oxford expects Ethiopia's inflation rate, already at multi-year highs to slow to 31.2% on year in the final quarter of 2022 from 32.1% on year in the third quarter, amid improved food supplies. ""Authorities are seeking to combat food price inflation through initiatives aimed at increasing food supply, such as wheat irrigation schemes and the improvement of agricultural productivity,"" Oxford says in a note. ""Headline inflation is projected to ease from 33.2% in 2022 to 28.7% in 2023 as strong annual base effects suppress m-o-m figures."" (nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com; @Nicholasbariyo)

473,"Voters Approve Tens of Billions of Dollars in Muni Projects -- WSJ

  By Heather Gillers 

 

     U.S. voters said yes to tens of billions of dollars for road-paving, school-building and other local projects last Tuesday, promising a new wave of bonds for eager investors. 

     The voters approved $57 billion out of the $63 billion in ballot measures for which results are available, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. If that 90% approval rate holds steady, the total amount of new municipal debt authorized Tuesday will come to about $90 billion, the most from any election day in the data, which goes back to 2012. 

     State and local governments have pulled back on borrowing this year, issuing $257 billion in tax-exempt debt through October, down 7.5% from the same period last year. Higher interest rates and inflation are driving up construction costs, leaving some public officials wary of new projects. Others still have pandemic aid and elevated tax revenue from last year's stimulus-fueled economy to draw on. 

     That means the roughly $4 trillion market has fewer new bonds for investors to buy with the cash they get as old ones come due. About a fifth of outstanding muni debt matures every three years, according to research firm Municipal Market Analytics. 

     ""Managers need to take that money and plow it back into tax-exempt bonds, "" said Municipal Market Analytics partner Matt Fabian. ""That can be a challenge when rates are rising and product is scarce."" The additional bond issuance is unlikely to affect prices much, he said, because demand will still far outpace supply. 

     Many towns and school districts must seek voter approval to issue bonds for local projects because residents' taxes could rise in order to pay back the debt. 

     Much of the money will be spent in the nation's fast-growing South and West, with $35 billion in Texas alone, by far the most of any state. 

     Voters in the Austin school district approved issuing more than $2 billion in bonds, the largest school-bond package ever approved in central Texas, according to the district. The money will pay for roof repairs and plumbing fixes, help upgrade security and athletic facilities, and replace school buses without air conditioning, among other improvements. 

     Voters in Mesa, Ariz., approved borrowing $157 million to renovate the city's police headquarters and build two new fire stations, among other public safety projects. Mayor John Giles said the additions would help Mesa ""respond to the needs of our fast-growing city."" 

     Baltimore got permission to borrow $160 million for schools, infrastructure, economic development and affordable housing projects, according to the S&P data. And early results in New York state show voters there likely approved a $4.2 billion bond issue for water infrastructure and environmental and climate-change mitigation projects. 

     In the Clover, S.C., school district, 30 miles southwest of Charlotte, N.C., voters narrowly approved a referendum to borrow $156 million to build a second high school. A $197 million proposal that also included an elementary school failed 70% to 30% last year, according to Bryan Dillon, the district's public information officer. 

     ""Listening tours, public forums, reports back, going to people in school buildings, going to churches -- we did a lot,"" Mr. Dillon said. 

     To accommodate new students in the fast-growing Charlotte metro area, the 9,100-student district has converted one of its middle schools to a ninth-grade campus and created temporary classrooms for middle-schoolers in faculty work areas and mobile units. 

     Officials expect the new high school to be complete in time for the 2026-27 school year.

474,"Bakkafrost: Operational EBIT of DKK 325 Million for the Third Quarter of 2022

(Figures in parenthesis refer to the same period last year unless 
otherwise specified) 
 
The Bakkafrost Group delivered a total operating EBIT of DKK 325 million 
(DKK 71 million) in Q3 2022 and made a profit of DKK 249 million (DKK 
131 million). The combined FO farming and VAP segments made an 
operational EBIT of DKK 444 million (DKK 146 million). The FO farming 
segment made an operational EBIT of DKK 444 million (DKK 135 million). 
The SCT farming segment made an operational EBIT of DKK -137 million 
(DKK -81 million). The VAP segment made an operational EBIT of DKK 0 
million (DKK 11 million). The EBITDA for the FOF segment was DKK 120 
million (DKK 111 million). 
 
Commenting on the result, CEO Regin Jacobsen said: 
 
""Overall, we are satisfied with the results from the Faroe Islands in 
this quarter, however not with the results from the Scottish farming 
segment. 
 
We are pleased to see continuing strong biological performance in the 
Faroe Islands with strong growth, all-time low sea lice levels and 
increased average harvest weights. We are also pleased with the positive 
results from the implemented changes in the large-smolt production 
regime in the Faroe Islands. This has resulted in more robust smolt with 
better biological performance. Declining mortality levels in the farming 
operation from the smolt produced after the changes were implemented 
demonstrate the impact of these changes for our farming operation in 
general and large-smolt production in the Faroe Islands and Scotland. 
 
We are not satisfied with the biological performance in the Scottish 
farming segment, where mortality rates have been higher than expected in 
this quarter. This reminds us, that we still face challenges while we 
await larger and better quality smolt. In Q2 2023, we will reach an 
important milestone in Scotland as we expect to release the first batch 
of large smolt from our Applecross hatchery. In the meanwhile, good 
biological risk mitigation is important and freshwater treatment 
capacity plays an important role here. Unfortunately, our new wellboat 
for Scotland was delayed, but was finally in operation in late 
September. Hereby we have significantly upscaled our freshwater 
treatment capacity which is now finally at a sufficient level. The new 
4,000m3 well-boat can treat for gill health issues as well as remove sea 
lice in one gentle treatment and the results so far are promising. 
 
Regarding the market, Q3 has been a quarter with large variations. The 
tight supply and high prices in the beginning of the quarter was 
replaced by significantly higher volumes supplied to the market in the 
second half of the quarter and at lower prices, however still well above 
previous years. Despite high inflation on food the demand for salmon is 
still strong which is reflected in contract prices for next year. 
Looking ahead into 2023, the supply growth in the salmon market will be 
tight with low single-digit growth."" 
 
Total harvested volumes for Q3 2022 were 25,000 tonnes gutted weight 
(21,900 tgw): 
 
  · FO: 16,900 tgw (14,900 tgw), 
  · SCT: 8,100 tgw (6,900 tgw). 
 
Total harvested volumes for the first nine months of 2022 were 66,100 
tonnes gutted weight (71,100 tgw): 
 
  · FO: 47,400 tgw (46,500 tgw), 
  · SCT: 18,700 tgw (24,600 tgw). 
 
In total, 6.6 million (7.0 million) smolts were trans­ferred during Q3 
2022: 
 
  · FO: 4.1 million (3.8 million), 
  · SCT: 2.4 million (3.3 million). 
 
In total, 17.0 million (16.3 million) smolts were trans­ferred during 
the first nine months of 2022: 
 
  · FO: 9.4 million (9.4 million), 
  · SCT: 7.5 million (6.9 million). 
 
The combined FO farming and VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 
444 million (DKK 146 million) in Q3 2022. The operational EBIT per kg in 
Q3 2022 was DKK 26.36 (DKK 9.79), corresponding to NOK 35.62 (NOK 
13.59). The FO Farming segment achieved higher prices in Q3 2022 than in 
Q3 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, the combined FO farming and 
VAP segments made an operational EBIT of DKK 1,395 million (DKK 713 
million). 
 
The SCT farming segment made an operational EBIT of DKK -137 million 
(DKK -81 million). In Q3 2022, the SCT farming segment had incident 
-based costs of DKK 121 million (DKK 69 million). For the first nine 
months of 2022, the operational EBIT was DKK -149 million (DKK -36 
million). 
 
The FOF segment made an 18% (20%) EBITDA margin. Fish feed sales 
amounted to 37,800 tonnes (45,000 tonnes) in Q3 2022. During Q3 2022, 
Havsbrún sourced 76,200 tonnes (17,200 tonnes) of raw material. For the 
first nine months of 2022, the EBITDA was 20% (18%). During the first 
nine months of 2022, Havsbrún sourced 251,800 tonnes (125,100 tonnes) of 
raw material. 
 
The net interest-bearing debt amounted to DKK 2,427 million at the end 
of Q3 2022, compared to DKK 2,126 million at year-end 2021. Undrawn 
credit facilities amounted to DKK 2,762 million at the end of Q3 2022. 
 
The equity ratio was 64% on 30 Sep 2022, com­pared to 64% at the end of 
2021. 
 
OUTLOOK 
 
Market 
 
Supply increase of 4% 
 
The supply of salmon increased 4.1% in Q3 2022, compared to Q3 2021 
incl. inventory movements. Without inventory movements, the supply 
increase was 6.6%, according to the latest estimate from Kontali 
Analyse. 
 
27% higher salmon prices 
 
Salmon spot prices were 27% higher in this quarter compared to Q3 2021. 
Strong demand for salmon, moderate supply increase and general inflation 
have contributed to high salmon prices in this quarter. 
 
No growth in 2022 
 
In Q4 2022, the global supply growth is expected to be around 1%. For 
the full year of 2022, the supply is expected to be on the same level as 
in 2021, including inventory movements. In H1 2023, zero growth is 
expected. 
 
Bakkafrost has a strong focus on ensuring a well-balanced flow to the 
different markets to increase diversification and mitigate market risk. 
Bakkafrost operates in the main salmon markets, Eu¬rope, the USA, and 
the Far East. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Bakkafrost has 
stopped all trading with Russia. 
 
Farming 
 
The strong biological performance in the Faroese farming operation seen 
in previous quarters has continued also in this quarter. Sea lice levels 
have been maintained at all-time low levels for this quarter and the low 
mortality rates have also continued in this quarter. 
 
The delivery of Bakkafrost's new Life Fish Carrier, Bakkafossur, has 
been delayed until Q4 2022. With its 7,000m3 tank capacity for seawater, 
3,000m3 for freshwater and a reverse osmosis system onboard for 
freshwater generation, Bakkafossur will strengthen Bakkafrost's 
capabilities to maintain low biological risk in the Faroe Islands. 
 
The expansions of the hatcheries at Norðtoftir and Glyvradal are 
progressing well and will start operations in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 
respectively. Combined, these capacity expansions will increase the 
smolt production capacity in the Faroe Islands with around 6.5 million 
smolts of 500g and are important milestones to fulfil Bakkafrost's goal 
to build an annual smolt production capacity in the Faroe Islands of 
over 23 million smolts of 500g in 2026. 
 
In Scotland, farming conditions in Q3 2022 have followed the normal 
seasonal pattern with significant biological challenges and higher 
mortality. Especially the Loch Fyne and East Lewis & Harris areas have 
been affected and suffered increased mortality. The negative development 
in the quarter was a continuation of the increased mortality in late Q2 
2022, which in particular affected farming sites with fish previously 
compromised in H2 2021. The mortality levels in Q3 2022 have been higher 
than expected and caused by different reasons, such as gill-related 
issues. 
 
In late September 2022, the new 4,000m3 Life Fish Carrier with 
freshwater treatment capacity, as well as an innovative in-line 
freshwater-based sea lice removal system was introduced in the farming 
operation in Scotland. This vessel can efficiently do dual treatments 
for gill-related issues as well as sea lice removal in one operation, 
thereby improving fish welfare while applying minimum stress on the 
fish. The results have been successful and together with the second Life 
Fish Carrier in operation, Bakkafrost has secured proficient treatment 
vessel capacity in Scotland. 
 
The biological risk in Scotland is still higher than in the Faroe 
Islands but is expected to be transformed with the implementation of 
Bakkafrost's large-smolt strategy. As demonstrated in the Faroe Islands, 
large high-quality and robust smolt will have a lower risk exposure in 
the marine environment due to shorter production cycles in the sea. This 
is expected to significantly reduce the biological risk in Scotland and 
is the cornerstone of the turnaround of the farming operation in 
Scotland. Therefore, it is Bakkafrost's topmost priority in Scotland to 
build new modern hatcheries. The ongoing expansion of the Applecross 
hatchery is progressing well and will reach an important milestone by 
the end of this year when the Applecross 4 expansion is expected to be 
completed. The first batch of large smolt delivered from Applecross 4 is 
planned for Q2 2023 and will contribute to increasing the mean weights 
and quality of the smolt stocked in Scotland in 2023. 
 
The full capacity of the Applecross hatchery, including the next 
expansions, will be in operation in mid-2024 bringing the overall annual 
production capacity from Applecross to around 10 million high 
-qualitysmolts of around 500g. 
 
In Q3 2022, the average weight of released smolt in Scotland was 107g, 
which is 9% higher than in Q3 2021. 
 
Bakkafrost plans to build 3 large hatcheries in Scotland, which will 
increase the total annual production capacity up to around 18 million 
smolts of around 500g in 2026. 
 
Smolt release 
 
Bakkafrost expects to release around 14.5 million large smolts in 2022 
in the Faroe Islands and around 10.8 million smolts of around 110g in 
Scotland. The number and the average weight of smolts released are key

475,"Electric Vehicles Require Lots of Scarce Parts. Is the Supply Chain Up to It? -- Journal Report

  By Bart Ziegler 

 

     The car industry is staging a revolution -- a transition from the gasoline and diesel engines that have powered vehicles for over 130 years to a battery-propelled future. 

     But a key part of the reinvention remains unfinished and filled with risk: the supply chains for the parts needed to assemble fully electric vehicles. 

     The guts of EVs -- high-capacity batteries, electric motors and the sophisticated electronics that mesh them together -- are nothing like the engine blocks, transmissions and drive shafts that move internal-combustion cars and trucks. 

     ""This industry is going through a transformation like it hasn't seen since World War II,"" says Akshay Singh, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers's automotive practice. ""The whole supply structure is going to change."" 

     On the upside, EVs require vastly fewer parts: An electric-car motor typically has only about 20 moving parts, compared with 200 or more in an internal combustion engine, according to Assembly magazine. 

     Yet the industry is young, and finding reliable sources for EV parts is daunting. Vehicle makers are deciding which parts to make on their own, sometimes through joint ventures, and which to source from their traditional component makers -- which themselves are undergoing radical restructurings to support the new electric world. 

     ""You can't take anything that you learned through [internal-combustion engines] and apply it to the EV supply chain,"" says Arun Kumar, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners. 

     Some pinch points: The batteries and most of the EV motors rely on unusual metals that can be costly and hard to obtain. The vehicles' electronics require new chips from a semiconductor industry still working through pandemic-era backlogs. Even the long aluminum trays that hold batteries beneath the floors of electric vehicles could end up scarce, Mr. Singh says. 

     Here's a look at the status of EV components -- and the supply chains that feed them -- as the industry gears up to make tens of millions of electric vehicles a year around the world. 

     Batteries 

     The good news: The cost of the lithium-ion batteries used in most EVs has fallen by more than half over the past five years. That lets EV makers pack in more batteries to allow a vehicle to go farther on a charge, as well as introduce lower-priced models. 

     But demand is surging, and battery makers face a number of hurdles. For one, the complexity and global logistics of the battery-making process -- from procuring raw materials, to refining them, to making the battery cells, to assembling battery packs -- could lead to bottlenecks. 

     ""There are supply chains within supply chains,"" says Edgar Faler, a senior industry analyst at the Center for Automotive Research. ""There are a lot of things that have to go right."" 

     One of the biggest potential problems is finding sufficient and affordable supplies of key raw materials, including lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt. Much of the mining and processing of these metals is based in just a few countries. Two-thirds of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where some workers face dangerous conditions that have prompted protests from human-rights groups. Australia mines about half the lithium, while nickel is centered in Indonesia. 

     The refining of these materials for use in batteries is even more concentrated: China processes some 70% of the world's lithium and cobalt, and 99% of the manganese, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. China also dominates the market for the parts that go into batteries, such as cathodes and anodes, as well as the production of batteries themselves. 

     ""The issue is going to be around supply-chain risk,"" says AlixPartners' Mr. Kumar. ""Countries like China could decide they don't want to offer the latest and greatest highly purified nickel. That could put the U.S. industry at a disadvantage."" 

     Battery makers, in fact, have been using more nickel, which can boost a battery's energy density, as they seek to expand the driving range of EVs. Some analysts project that the high-grade nickel that batteries require could be in short supply as EV sales rise. 

     Already, prices for nickel and several other battery ingredients have been soaring. Battery-grade cobalt was up 53% from Jan. 1, 2020, through October 2022, nickel sulfate rose 56%, and lithium carbonate soared 979%, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The consulting firm says these increases mean battery prices could rise this year for the first time since at least the early 2000s. 

     Meanwhile, a few car makers are already predicting battery shortages. ""Put very simply, all the world's [battery] cell production combined represents well under 10% of what we will need in 10 years,"" RJ Scaringe, chief executive of EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc., said in April. He added that ""90% to 95% of the battery supply chain does not exist."" 

     Others don't believe there will be a battery shortage anytime soon. The expansion of EV manufacturing ""will start to put some strains on the [battery supply] system,"" says Ram Chandrasekaran, principal analyst of transport and mobility at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. But ""we don't forecast a deficit in battery packs for the next 10 years."" 

     Wood Mackenzie says car makers won't flood the market with EVs but instead pace their production to the availability of batteries and the minimum level of output needed to meet government greenhouse-gas mandates. 

     Mr. Chandrasekaran also says the recently passed federal Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits for producers of battery packs whose rechargeable cells are sourced domestically, ""will go a long way in stabilizing the United States battery supply over the next five to 10 years."" 

     More car makers plan to build new U.S. battery plants, many of them in joint ventures with Asian battery makers. Among them, Tesla Inc. is working with Panasonic Holdings Corp., General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co. have separately joined with LG Energy Solution Ltd., Ford Motor Co. is working with SK Innovation, and Stellantis NV has joined with Samsung SDI Co. 

     But these new factories can have hiccups. GM last month dialed back its EV sales target, citing startup issues with a new battery plant in Ohio. GM had expected to sell 400,000 EVs from early 2022 through the end of next year but pushed out the time frame until mid-2024. 

     Car makers also are signing long-term supply contracts for access to battery raw materials. Moreover, the recycling of batteries from EVs as they are scrapped at the end of their life will provide another source of the minerals. AlixPartners' Mr. Kumar says 20% to 40% of EV raw-material demand could be met through recycling by 2030. 

     Meanwhile, some EV makers, including Tesla and those in China, are using a different battery chemistry, lithium iron phosphate, for certain vehicles. These batteries don't require nickel or cobalt and so are less costly than lithium-ion ones, though they can't store as much power, says Mr. Kumar. 

     Electric motors 

     The majority of motors used in today's EVs rely on permanent magnets, which produce a constant magnetic field that helps spin a motor's rotor and, in turn, power the wheels. 

     But these magnets require costly rare-earth metals such as neodymium and dysprosium. As with battery ingredients, the dominant supplier is China, and producing the metals can cause pollution, which could raise issues for investors who shun companies linked to environmental damage. 

     EV makers have a recourse: alternating-current induction motors, which have no permanent magnets. Instead, they use coils of copper wire to create a magnetic field that drives the motor. 

     AC induction motors -- invented in the 19th century and widely used in household appliances and industrial applications -- are less expensive but also less efficient. That can reduce a vehicle's driving range unless battery storage is boosted. 

     Yet as battery capacity grows and many experts expect the cost of batteries to resume their decline, the industry will move away from motors that require rare-earth metals, Mr. Kumar predicts. Tesla has long used AC induction motors in some models and other car makers are now considering them. 

     On top of this, analysts expect more vehicle makers to outsource some of their motor needs -- which could expand industrywide capacity by increasing the number of sites making motors -- rather than making them in-house, as most currently do. Overall, analysts don't see the motor supply posing as big a hurdle as batteries. 

     Electronics 

     EVs are like rolling computers. Consulting firm P3 Group says they require more than twice as many semiconductor chips as internal-combustion vehicles -- some 1,300 versus 600. 

     Chips control everything from how EVs take electricity from their batteries to how that juice is applied to the motors to how the batteries are recharged. They convert the batteries' direct-current output to AC, which most motors need. And as with most vehicles, chips manage braking, climate control and safety features like air bags. 

     All that demands a robust supply chain, something made glaringly clear the past few years as car makers had to limit output due to a chip shortage. 

     Analysts don't foresee the EV industry facing chip shortfalls in the future. Mr. Kumar, for one, is optimistic that plans by several chip makers to build more U.S. plants, spurred in part by the $280 billion federal Chips and Science Act passed this year, will help boost supply to meet the EV ramp-up. 

     One wild card, he says, is how much vehicle makers continue to rely on Taiwan, the world's dominant semiconductor maker. Taiwan ""has its own geopolitical issues,"" Mr. Kumar says, referring to its fraught relationship with China, which claims the island nation as its own.

476,"Deckers Didn&apos;t Offer Great Black Friday Deals. That&apos;s Good News for the Stock. -- Barrons.com

Teresa Rivas 

     Consumers found plenty of good deals this Black Friday on everything from toys to T-shirts -- except Hoka sneakers. That might be bad news for runners, but good news for owner Decker Outdoors. 

     While shopping was the unofficial national pastime during the pandemic, when few other options were available, retailers have had a rougher 2022. With the world reopening, stores have to compete with experiences like travel and restaurants for Americans' entertainment budgets -- and those are smaller overall thanks to record inflation. 

     The upshot is stores began running holiday promotions in October, hoping to capture shoppers' discretionary dollars before they ran out entirely. That trend continued over the long holiday weekend: Shoppers turned out in force to take advantage of generous discounts. 

     However those steep sales often hurt retailers' margins, and in turn their bottom lines. Aggressive markdowns this summer in the face of overstocked inventory and falling demand led to a broad selloff in retail, as many companies slashed their profit outlooks. 

     That's what makes Deckers' (ticker: DECK) lack of discounting stand out, particularly a time when nearly all of its peers were running sales that were as or more generous than last year. 

     Jefferies analysts Randal Konik and his team found that nearly three-quarters of the 54 retailers they follow offered steeper discounts than 2021, while the rest at least matched last year. Moreover, he writes that the ""activewear retailers -- Lululemon Athletica (LULU), Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA) -- stood out as being more promotional."" 

     In fact, the Black Friday sales event was marked by a ""big escalation of promotional activity,"" writes Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic, so much so that the question remains whether or not this signals ""a race to the bottom between now and January."" 

     Yet he calls Deckers the one ""shining star,"" from the last week. Given that Ugg tends to generate about half its annual revenue from the holiday season, it's encouraging to hear that everything appears to be falling into place. 

     It was one of the only brands Nikic tracks that was less promotional over the last week than they were in 2021 at both its full-line and outlet stores, and discounts were also low at partner stores such as Nordstrom (JWN) and Macy's (M). Likewise online search activity remains robust, as does social media buzz around its high-demand styles. 

     That's a trend that Piper Sandler's Abbie Zvejnieks highlighted as well: ""Ugg promotions were limited on core classics, and we think momentum behind styles such as Platform, where Ugg may be unable to chase the current demand, is increasing demand for other classics."" 

     She also notes that when it comes to the ""broadly higher promotions across both apparel and footwear,"" online, Hoka and fellow ultra-cushioned sneaker maker On Holdings' (ONON) On Running ""did not participate."" 

     That tracks with what Barron's argued when we recommended Deckers stock in October. We noted that Uggs had become a more stable source of earnings at the same time that Hoka was making impressive inroads with both runners and fashionistas. The shares are up nearly 14% since. 

     If its two main brands do pull off another robust holiday season without resorting to the discounting that's plagued the sector, Deckers could add to those gains. Higher earnings would in turn make the stock's valuation, which isn't as compelling as it was when our article was published last month, more appealing. 

     For their parts, Nikic and Zvejnieks think the stock will be able to keep running. Nikic has an Outperform rating and $410 price target on the shares while Zvejnieks has a Buy rating and $440 price target. 

     NFJ Investment Group Chief Investment Officer John Mowrey, who owns Deckers and praised it in October, tells Barron's he still bullish on the stock, as he thinks it will benefit from structural tailwinds that will extend beyond the holiday season. ""The consistency of Deckers' earnings and margin profile are a major advantage relative to many other competitors."" 

     We agree, and even if the stock -- much like its shoes -- is no longer on sale, it should still be on investors' radars.

477,"Must Inflation Be Brought Down All the Way to 2%? -- Heard on the Street -- WSJ

  By Jon Sindreu 

 

     ""Why must inflation be around 2%?"" is a question that obsessed central bankers back when inflation was stubbornly below their favorite target. It makes more sense to ask it now. 

     This past week, a string of data has suggested that inflation is finally on a downward trend. The U.S. personal-consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy -- the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation -- recorded its second-smallest monthly increase for the year, even as consumer spending jumped and job growth continued. Meanwhile, eurozone inflation receded to 10% in November, suggesting that October's 10.6% was the peak. 

     Stocks have rallied, especially after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that interest rates will go up in smaller increments from now on. But he also indicated that the tightening is far from over. Indeed, central bankers don't ultimately care if inflation stops rising: They want it to go down, back to the 2% number they are mandated to hit. 

     It underscores the misalignment between their interests and everybody else's, which should worry investors. 

     Inflation in many rich countries has been decelerating since July, yet economists don't expect it to return to 2% until a distant 2025, based on median forecasts. Derivatives markets price in that the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will stop raising rates in 2023, cut them later in the year, and then sit on their laurels for two full years as inflation grinds down. 

     But what if inflation stabilizes at a higher rate -- say between 4% and 6%? In this plausible case, central banks may be compelled to start needlessly raising rates again, catching investors off guard. It would make a lot more sense to raise the inflation target instead, or define it as a wider range. 

     Yes, out-of-control inflation involves large disruption, as uncertainty about costs gives businesses a reason to cut production, and workers with diminishing purchasing power resort to strikes. But such problems stem from inflation accelerating, not its being high. 

     Inflation of 4% is perfectly compatible with a healthy economy that isn't overheating. A possible reason would be the fragmentation of global supply chains, which research suggests previously suppressed price pressures. 

     Some on Wall Street fear pay wouldn't keep up and hit consumption, as the commodity shock is doing now. But, in the long term, economies tend to grow, which means ""real"" incomes do too. And historical data shows no evidence that higher inflation diverts less of this income to wages relative to profits, or vice versa. 

     To be sure, problems arise when inflation is very high or, by contrast, when there is deflation. This is why most economists advocate a small but positive rate of price growth. 

     There is no reason it must be 2%, however. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which pioneered inflation targeting in 1989, arbitrarily chose a 0%-to-2% range simply because then-Minister of Finance Roger Douglas thought it sounded low. It probably helped that the historical median CPI growth in countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. was roughly 2%. 

     There could be trouble if raising the inflation target in itself triggered wage pressures that fed back into prices. Back when inflation stayed below 2%, economists such as Olivier Blanchard, Larry Summers and Jordi Galí insisted it was a problem in need of solving, and that a higher target could do it. This outcome is unlikely, though: Expectations of inflation are less important in price setting than whatever inflation has just done. 

     For the sake of workers, firms and investors, the time to rethink targets is neither when inflation is low nor when it is accelerating, but when it is high and stable.

478,"Income Investing: Bonds Have Been Awful. Now Is the Time to Buy Them. -- Barron&apos;s

By Lawrence C. Strauss 

     Bond investors will be glad to see 2022 in the rearview mirror before long. 

     ""It has been a long and quite painful year for sure, given that most parts of the market are down 10-plus percent or so,"" says Anders Persson, chief investment officer for global fixed income at Nuveen. 

     An aggressive dose of short-term rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tame inflation has weighed heavily on bond prices. 

     The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index is down about 11% year to date, including interest payments. Exchange-traded funds that track high-yield securities, long-term Treasuries, and investment-grade credits all have notched double-digit losses as well. 

     But that wretched performance could lead to better results in 2023, partly because ""we're starting with yield levels now that are much more interesting and appealing to investors,"" says Persson. 

     The 10-year U.S. Treasury note, for example, yields about 3.5%, up from around 1.5% at the end of 2021. (Bond prices and yields move inversely.) 

     ""The world had accepted lower yields and that there wasn't really a lot of income in fixed income,"" says Kay Herr, head of fixed-income research at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ""And we finally had a reset."" 

     A silver lining heading into the new year is that there's a lot more income available from bonds than there was a year ago. 

     With rates moving up so dramatically this year, many investors have piled into the short end of the curve. The two-year Treasury yields around 4.2%, for example. 

     Still, ""you can move a little bit out the curve from cash and from Treasuries into investment-grade bonds and pick up incremental yield,"" says Ashish Shah, chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. ""You don't have to take a lot of risk."" 

     The SPDR Portfolio Short Term Bond ETF (ticker: SPSB) recently had a yield to maturity of about 5%. 

     Steve Cianci, co-head of the global fixed-income team at MacKay Shields, says the yields on investment-grade bond strategies at his firm range from 5% to 7% -- a big contrast from what had been available until recently. Portfolio managers ""had to move well outside of public fixed income to private debt, to high yield, and to other, less-high-quality asset classes to get those kind of yields,"" he says. 

     Bond investors no doubt will be watching the Fed, in particular its rate policy. ""What the Fed is going to do, what's going to happen with inflation, and the likelihood of a recession -- that's what you really need to think about pricing in,"" says Herr. 

     A recession is considered likely, partly because of an inverted yield curve. But the magnitude of such an event remains uncertain, especially if the Fed can engineer a soft landing. 

     Matt Nest, global head of active fixed income at State Street Global Advisors, says his top investment idea for 2023 is long-term Treasuries. 

     The 10-year Treasury has rallied recently, a result Nest ascribes to the bond market anticipating a decline in inflation and economic growth. It was recently yielding 3.5%, down from around 4.25% in October. 

     Nest sees longer-term Treasuries as a good hedge against either a soft or hard economic landing. ""If you get a soft landing, inflation slows down, you don't go into recession, and everything turns out OK in fixed income,"" he says. But if there's a hard landing, he says, ""Treasuries do well and everything else does poorly."" Treasuries would be considered a haven in those circumstances. 

     Persson says Nuveen has ""a little bit more of an up-in-quality tilt in our investing"" and that ""diversification is incredibly important."" 

     Among his ideas are BBB corporate credits, which are at the low end of investment grade, and BB issues -- the upper range in terms of quality for high-yield bonds. 

     Municipal bonds have lost about 7% year to date, better than the broader bond market. Yields on high-quality munis are above 4%, about double their levels at the beginning of the year, according to John Miller, head of municipals at Nuveen. 

     He adds that this bond sector overall is well fortified to withstand an economic downturn, pointing to attractive valuations, strong credit quality, healthy government cash levels, and flat new bond supply. 

     Real estate investment trusts, a popular vehicle for income investors, have also struggled. The iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) has returned minus 20.5% this year. REITs, which are known for their attractive dividends, are seen as having some bondlike characteristics, making them vulnerable at times to rising rates and inflation. 

     ""REITs are now about fairly priced,"" says Cedrik Lachance, director of research at Green Street, which analyzes real estate. ""REITs haven't been close to that in a long time while rates were going up."" He adds, ""As an entry point, today is an OK day."" 

     One of the few bright spots for income investors this year has been dividend stocks. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes stalwarts such as Coca-Cola (KO) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), has returned minus 2.5% this year, well ahead of the minus 14% result for the S&P 500. 

     Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at BofA Securities, says that she expects S&P 500 earnings to shrink by about 10% in 2023. 

     ""That would normally be a risk for dividends,"" she says. ""But given how low the payout ratio is, there are very few sectors with dividends that look unsafe at this point."" 

     The S&P 500's dividend ratio -- the percentage of earnings that gets paid out in dividends -- is around 30%, far below its long-term average of 50%, according to BofA Global Research. 

     ""If you're buying high-quality companies that can maintain their dividend because their earnings don't collapse in a recession, then you will do well,"" says Michael Liss, a portfolio manager at American Century Investments. One example he cites: oil-services company Baker Hughes (BKR), which yields 2.6%.

479,"Lawmakers Boost Military, Domestic Spending in Bill Funding Government for Fiscal 2023 -- WSJ

  By Siobhan Hughes and Lindsay Wise 

 

     WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers early Tuesday unveiled a wide-ranging spending bill for fiscal 2023 with sharp increases in military and domestic funding, kicking off a sprint to pass the bill before Christmas in the last act of the Democratic-controlled Congress. 

     The bill, the product of months of behind-the-scenes haggling, also carries an additional $44.9 billion in aid to help Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, $40.6 billion for disasters such as drought and hurricanes, as well as funds earmarked for projects in lawmakers' home districts. It includes changes to the 1887 Electoral Count Act that would make it harder to block the certification of a presidential election, widens a ban on TikTok on government devices, and extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing Co. to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. 

     The bill includes $858 billion in military spending, $45 billion more than President Biden had requested and up about 10% from $782 billion the prior year. Senate negotiators said it also includes $772.5 billion in nondefense discretionary spending, up almost 6% from $730 billion from the prior year. 

     Congress must pass the spending package through both chambers before the expiration of an interim funding bill that runs through Dec. 23. Because of the delays built into the Senate's process, quick enactment will depend on whether all 100 senators can agree to forgo debate time and proceed to a final vote. The Senate is expected to vote first, followed by the House, where leaders have told lawmakers to expect a vote late Wednesday at the earliest. 

     The bill will require support of at least 10 Republicans in the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes are required for most legislation to advance. Many House Republicans have urged their Senate colleagues to reject the package and push talks into next year, when the GOP will control the House. But Republican senators have largely coalesced behind the plan. 

     The Biden administration said it supports the legislation. 

     ""Our bipartisan, bicameral, omnibus appropriations bill directly invests in providing relief from the burden of inflation on the American people, "" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Pat Leahy (D., Vt.). ""The choice is clear: We can either do our jobs and fund the government, or we can abandon our responsibilities without a real path forward."" 

     Senate Republicans said that the increases in military spending represented GOP victories, claiming that the deal broke a yearslong bargain to ensure parity between increases in defense and nondefense spending. That is because the annual inflation rate was 7.1% in November, and while the defense-spending increase exceeded that level, the nondefense discretionary spending increase fell short of the inflation rate. 

     ""Since day one, I have insisted on increasing defense funding well above the president's request without similar increases in wasteful liberal nondefense spending,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""This process was far from perfect, but ultimately it allowed Republican redlines to be adhered to and because of that I will urge my colleagues to support this package."" 

     The bill incorporates the Senate's version of the Electoral Count Reform Act, bipartisan legislation that overhauls an 1887 law governing how Congress counts and ratifies presidential elector votes. The bill was written in response to efforts by former President Donald Trump and his supporters to try to overturn the 2020 election results. It would make clear that Congress's role in ratifying states' Electoral College votes is ministerial only, and that the vice president's role is limited to counting the votes publicly. 

     It would dramatically raise the threshold to sustain an objection to a state's electors from one House member and one senator to one-fifth of both chambers, and establish a fast-tracked judicial review of disputes related to states' elector certificates, including a three-judge panel with a direct appeal to the Supreme Court. 

     Left out of the package were several initiatives pushed by lawmakers outside the spending negotiations. The bill didn't expand the child tax credit for low-income families, as some Democrats wanted, or reinstate the immediate deduction of research costs incurred by businesses, as some Republicans and companies sought. 

     A provision that would have offered green cards to evacuated Afghans in the U.S., known as the Afghan Adjustment Act, wasn't included. But lawmakers did include an extension of the special immigrant visa program for Afghans who worked alongside the American military through 2024. 

     The spending package kept annual funding for the Internal Revenue Service essentially flat. Republicans had sought cuts, complaining that Democrats already made the tax agency flush after approving $80 billion in the climate, healthcare and tax legislation that Mr. Biden signed in August. The less the IRS gets each year, the more that $80 billion will be used to backfill routine costs instead of IRS expansion. 

     Democrats highlighted the inclusion of $5 billion in mandatory funding for a toxic-exposures fund to cover healthcare for about two-dozen health conditions that the Department of Veterans Affairs now considers automatically related to military service, including diseases related to exposure to burn pits in combat zones. That was well above the $1.4 billion that the Congressional Budget Office estimated would be needed this year. 

     The bill also would ban the downloading of TikTok on government-issued smartphones and other devices, expanding to all government devices a ban currently imposed by the Pentagon and some other U.S. agencies. A separate bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent earlier this month but had not been brought up in the House. The legislation comes amid widening concerns over the Chinese-owned video app's security risks for the U.S. 

     One provision in the 4,155-page legislation gives Boeing more time to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. The Dec. 27 deadline had been set by Congress two years ago, but Federal Aviation Administration approvals have taken longer than expected. Without an extension, Boeing said in a securities filing that it might cancel both planes, exposing it to financial losses. Orders for the planes are valued at tens of billions of dollars in revenue. 

     House Republican leaders have urged their rank-and-file members to oppose the package arguing that negotiations should be pushed into next year, when GOP control of the chamber will give it more leverage. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) is leading the opposition as he seeks to cajole members to support his bid to be elected House speaker next year. 

     But because a majority of Democrats can pass the bill without Republican support, much of the focus is on the Senate. Top Senate Republicans are calling for passage, saying that they limited nondefense spending on domestic programs through their negotiations. The main question is whether Senate Republicans opposed to the bill will exercise their power to slow down the voting beyond Dec. 23, the last day of government funding. 

     ""I object to a budget that nobody will see to the very end, thousands of pages long, created by a few people basically in secret,"" Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) told reporters on Monday night, referring to the closed-door negotiations over the spending bill. ""I see no value to this process. We're ruining the country.""

480,"U.K. Sets Higher Corporate Tax Rate -- WSJ

  The change brings companies higher costs, but some much needed certainty 

By Jennifer Williams-Alvarez and Nina Trentmann 

     U.K. finance chiefs finally know what's coming: Higher taxes. 

     Faced with a weaker currency, rising financing costs and surging inflation, finance executives' already fraught budget planning was upended earlier this fall after the country's government announced sharp, debt-funded tax cuts, only to withdraw them after the pound tumbled to a 37-year low and financial markets gyrated. Now, under a new prime minister, the government is pledging fiscal austerity, accompanied by an increase in the corporate tax rate to 25%. 

     With the latest change, the corporate tax rate has flip-flopped four times in less than a year. The tax increase, from the current rate of 19%, will apply to companies with annual profit of more than GBP250,000, equivalent to more than $307,000. The higher rate is set to raise around GBP18 billion in additional tax income a year, the government said in October. 

     A few months before the levy is set to take effect in April, finance executives say they welcome the certainty -- if not the higher taxes -- as they prepare their budgets for 2023. With a host of other hurdles on the horizon, from rising financing costs to a tight labor market, it is one less wild card. 

     ""What I really disliked was, at one point it was going down, then it was going back again, then it was going down and now it is going back up again,"" said Associated British Foods PLC Finance Director John Bason, referring to the corporate tax rate. ""We can plan ahead now. We know it is increasing to 25%."" 

     The U.K. government's change brings the corporate tax rate in line with those of other large economies. Both China and France have the same rate, the U.S. is at 21% at the federal level while Germany's corporate levy effectively is at 30%, according to professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. 

     Associated British Foods, the owner of fast-fashion chain Primark and other businesses, will see its full-year tax bill increase by around GBP20 million from a total of roughly GBP300 million due to the tax change, Mr. Bason said. ABF, which reported a 22% increase in annual revenue to GBP17 billion and a 46% increase in operating profit to around GBP1.2 billion, said it would review its investment plans in the U.K. ""We certainly will look at our investments,"" Mr. Bason said. ""But at this point, it is not leading to a reappraisal of any of the investments that we're making."" 

     For London-based financial technology company Wise PLC, clarity around the corporate tax is helpful as the company looks to expand its business, Chief Financial Officer Matt Briers said. ""All we ask for in the U.K. is that it is predictable and stable,"" Mr. Briers said. 

     Wise, which reported a 55% increase in revenue to GBP397 million and saw total income rise 63% to GBP416 million for the six months ended Sept. 30, is working to maintain its profit margin and run its business more efficiently, Mr. Briers said. ""The tax rate we certainly can't control. ... Those are the controllables,"" Mr. Briers said, referring to Wise's profit and its plans to save capital. 

     U.K. companies planning for 2023 are weighing factors such as access to labor -- which is more limited after the U.K.'s exit from the European Union -- inflation, financing costs and future tax obligations, said Sharon Bell, European equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ""Of course, clarity is a very useful thing,"" Ms. Bell said about the increase in the corporate tax rate. 

     U.K. companies' costs are rising on multiple fronts. Interest rates have gone up to 3% and are expected to rise further, which is driving up borrowing costs. That is after a decade during which many companies were able to renew financing terms at cheaper rates than those that they previously had as the Bank of England loosened monetary policy, Ms. Bell said. Borrowing costs for all businesses have risen, she said, with European companies looking to refinance now facing rates of around 4% to 5%, up from 1% to 2% a year or two ago. 

     Inflation rose to a 41-year high in October, running at 11.1% as prices for energy and other items have surged. The pound remains down more than 7% from a year earlier at around $1.23. 

     The outlook for companies is getting darker. U.K. companies issued 86 profit warnings in the third quarter, up from 51 a year earlier and 64 in the previous quarter, according to EY-Parthenon, the strategy arm of professional services firm Ernst & Young. More companies in the third quarter issued their third or more warning in a 12-month period, according to Jo Robinson, a turnaround and restructuring strategy leader at EY-Parthenon. 

     ""Businesses are facing an unprecedented combination of headwinds, including rising costs, slowing demand and excess supply, making it increasingly difficult to balance competing priorities,"" Ms. Robinson said, according to a release. ""Increasing uncertainty means that events could move quickly for companies that show signs of stress."" 

     But compared with a few months ago, the economic outlook is more stable, said ABF's Mr. Bason. Interest rates are higher, but aren't rising as rapidly as before, and the U.S. dollar has lost some of its strength, he said. 

     ""Some of those moves, particularly interest rate moves and exchange rate moves, were so extreme,"" Mr. Bason said. ""We're in a better place.""

481,"The Computers Driving the Oil Market Get Fresh Scrutiny -- WSJ

  By Bob Henderson 

 

     It has been a tough year for oil traders. Even the computers haven't been able to get it right consistently. 

     Wall Street is closely tracking firms that use trend-following algorithms to trade oil futures, which profited mightily from betting on higher prices as crude climbed to more than $120 per barrel this spring. But with oil falling bumpily since June, the trend-followers have waffled between bullish and bearish wagers and given some of those profits back. 

     Analysts are blaming them for amplifying oil's wild price swings. Traders are monitoring them to steer clear of the waves they make in the market. Investors are mimicking them for profit. And this year's oil-price roller-coaster ride is putting their logic to the test. 

     Recent research from Goldman Sachs cited so-called commodity trading advisers for intensifying a recent five-week slide in which oil dropped nearly 23%. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, landed at a recent low around $79 a barrel, close to where it started the year. 

     Commodity trading adviser, or CTA, is industry jargon for a hedge fund that uses computer algorithms to divine and follow price trends, typically by comparing recent prices to their average over a previous period. Despite their name, CTAs trade futures on currencies, stocks, and bonds in addition to commodities such as oil. 

     Like previous ones, ""the most recent selloff, has also been associated with substantial CTA liquidations,"" says Daniel Ghali, senior commodities strategist at TD Securities. 

     While stocks and bonds have tumbled this year, CTAs have posted returns exceeding 18%. They have thrived by betting on gains in the U.S. dollar and in bond yields, which were propelled higher by the postpandemic recovery and the Fed's fight against inflation, and in commodity prices, which skyrocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

     But commodities may be particularly apt targets for trend-following due to their susceptibility to boom-and-bust price cycles -- and because their long-term appreciation may be threatened by innovation, substitution and conservation. 

     TD Securities estimates that 30% of commodities futures trading flow is from CTAs. Mr. Ghali said that number ""dramatically understates"" their influence on price changes taking place over days or weeks since, he estimates, another 50% comes from high-frequency trading algorithms that enter and exit trades too quickly to affect prices over those time scales. 

     CTAs and other investors provide beneficial liquidity and balance to the oil market, since far more oil is sold via futures and other derivatives by oil producers looking to hedge their exposure than is bought by consumers such as airlines doing the opposite. Investors bridge the divide. 

     ""Oil has been a very strong, positive contributor,"" to CTA performance, since the advent of fracking for shale oil hit prices hard in 2014, says Chad Martinson, CIO of Efficient Capital Management, which allocates $2.5 billion of investor assets to 25 CTAs. The energy subsector is the biggest contributor to his fund's 24% returns this year. 

     Oil traders who live by their wits in lieu of algorithms nonetheless pay companies such as Bridgeton Research Group for intel on CTAs that could lessen the likelihood they will buy just before CTAs sell and lower prices, or vice versa. 

     ""We look ahead, almost like a radar,"" says Stephen Roseme, Bridgeton's co-founder. ""If you're driving an F1 car, you want to know that there's some water ahead on the road."" 

     Bridgeton runs its own trend-following algorithm that imitates the CTAs. Their model estimates they sold about 85 million barrels worth of Brent futures during their recent five-week rout, and suggests that nearly 30% of those sales occurred the same day Brent took its biggest hit, of $3.33 on December 6. 

     ""When everybody is on the same side of the boat, it is a sizable position in the market,"" says Jerry Prior, COO and portfolio manager at Mount Lucas Management LP, a CTA that is up about 27% this year. 

     Prior's algorithm began buying crude in 2021, held a maximally long oil position going into the war in Ukraine, but didn't start selling until September, even though prices had been sinking since June. His fund is now short oil, consistent with Bridgeton's assessment of CTAs overall. 

     ""It's been a little interesting,"" on the way down, Mr. Prior says. But he also considers his algorithm's reluctance to cash out of winning trades more quickly a feature not a bug. 

     ""Human nature wants you to get out of that trade earlier,"" he said. Still, he added, it is the all-too-human propensity to cling to past gains that will ""eat your lunch"" by making you trade too much. 

     Algorithms ""don't care about headlines. They don't care about losing their year. They don't care about explaining to clients why they used to be long something and now they're short something,"" says Andrew Beer, managing member of Dynamic Beta Investments and co-portfolio manager of the iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy exchange-traded fund. 

     While some pros are surveilling CTA flows to trade around them, Beer's firm profits by piggybacking on them. Each day, it estimates the average positions of the 20 largest CTAs with a statistical model that compares their recent profits and losses to the price changes of 10 of the most highly traded futures contracts. The iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy ETF, which holds those estimated positions, is up about 20% this year. 

     But the fourth quarter hasn't been kind to the CTAs. The trends that powered their performance earlier this year have largely petered out resulting in a pullback in profits. Despite oil's outsize contribution to their bottom lines, Bridgeton's modeling suggests the CTAs have been losing on their oil trades since May, in part from holding on to bullish bets even as prices declined, and because severe volatility has tricked their algorithms into a few false starts. 

     ""We're now in a period of uncertainty,"" says Mr. Roseme. ""These funds are looking for direction, but not seeing it."" 

     A closer look at Bridgeton's estimates of CTA selling during oil's recent five-week slide suggests that the bulk of their sales occurred in the days following drops, rather than at the same time. So, while traders are eyeing the algorithms, the algorithms are looking right back. 

     ""It's called trend-following,"" says Mount Lucas's Mr. Prior. ""The key word there is 'follow'.""

482,"Biggest Pay Raises Went to Black Workers, Young People and Low-Wage Earners -- WSJ

  By Gabriel T. Rubin 

 

     Black workers, young workers and people on the bottom of the income scale were among those who saw the largest pay increases last year, when employers were readily handing out raises in a tight labor market and high inflation environment. 

     Median weekly earnings for all workers were 7.4% higher, year over year, at the end of 2022, according to an analysis of newly released Labor Department data. That outpaced the consumer inflation rate of 7.1% in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. 

     For some workers, the gains were even larger. The median raise for Black Americans employed full time was 11.3%, compared with the prior year. Weekly pay for workers between 16- and 24-years old rose more than 10%. The bottom 10th of wage earners -- those that make about $570 a week -- saw their pay increase by nearly 10%. 

     The pay increases were welcome relief for those groups who have experienced ""decades of pain"" in the labor market, said Aaron Sojourner, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. ""It's been a struggle for those folks to find a productive place in the community where they can contribute and earn and build families and success."" 

     While the labor market remains tight, both wage gains and broader inflation have begun to cool, along with consumer spending. That is the result of the Federal Reserve's efforts to stifle demand and bring down inflation. Workers' ability to continue to receive large pay increases this year is likely under pressure. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast job losses in 2023, after recent strong hiring. 

     Here is a look at which Americans saw the largest, and smallest, raises in 2022. 

     Better pay increases late last year went to workers who attended college, a reversal from earlier in the pandemic when those who hadn't completed high school saw outsize gains. 

     The annual rate of wage growth for workers with less than a high school diploma touched a recent peak in the second quarter of 2022, when it was up 11.1% over the prior year, higher than the 7.6% wage growth during that period for workers with a bachelor's degree or higher. 

     But by the end of 2022, the median worker without a high school diploma was making $675 a week, or 3.7% more than during the last quarter of 2021. Wage gains for the less educated plummeted as more low-skilled jobs were filled and economic growth cooled. 

     The median worker with at least a bachelor's degree, by contrast, saw 5.5% wage growth from a year earlier to $1,547 a week. Those who only finished high school saw a 5.3% annual raise. 

     Wage growth was uneven across racial groups. 

     The median Black worker's weekly pay increased at the fastest rate among those measured, growing to $896 from $805 a year earlier. The median Hispanic or Latino worker saw a 4.8% raise to $837 a week. White and Asian workers saw wage growth slightly higher than the overall workforce. 

     Still, white and Asian workers continued to earn far more than other racial groups. Median weekly earnings for full-time Asian workers was $1,496, and white workers earned $1,111. 

     By sex, weekly wages for the median woman rose 5% to $975 in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. The median man received a 6.6% raise to $1,176 a week. Women had median weekly earnings that were 82.9% of that for men. 

     The rate of raises between workers ages 16 to 24 and other age groups widened in 2022. 

     It isn't unusual for young workers to experience faster wage growth in percentage terms, largely because they typically start from the lowest base. A person making $15 an hour who gets a 10% raise is now making $16.50 an hour. 

     That youngest cohort, earning a median of $716 a week, ended the year with 10.8% annual wage growth, compared with 7.2% for the next-strongest group, aged 25 to 54. The median worker in those prime working years earned $1,134 a week. At the end of 2021, younger workers had 5.2% annual wage growth, and prime-age workers saw a 4.4% gain. 

     Older workers, those in the 55-64 bracket and those over 65 years old, who often start from higher bases compared with younger cohorts, saw the slowest wage growth last year, at 2.8% and 3.9%, respectively. 

     The lowest-paid workers saw larger raises last year than the top 10% of wage earners. 

     Those in the bottom 10% saw weekly pay grow 9.8% from a year earlier at the end of 2022, to $571 a week. The top 10% received a raise of 5.7%, to $2,584 a week. 

     Gains for low-income and low-skilled workers drove broader wage growth throughout the post-reopening period of the pandemic, as employers who shed workers in 2020 scrambled to hire, and retain, workers. Quit rates soared as workers found that they could jump to another job for higher wages, with the mismatch between job openings and available workers at an all-time high. 

     Those fast gains have cooled. Hiring in sectors such as leisure and hospitality and retail eased toward the end of last year.

483,"Global Forex and Fixed Income Roundup: Market Talk

   The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. 

  0859 GMT - After Malaysia's central bank unexpectedly held its benchmark interest rate at 2.75% this afternoon, MIDF Research reckons it will opt to hike the rate to 3.00% at its next meeting in March. MIDF also expects Bank Negara to raise the statutory reserve-requirement rate this year, bringing it back to the prepandemic level of 3.0% from 2.0% currently. Although Bank Negara's March decision will ultimately be based on macroeconomic conditions, the research house thinks that from a medium-term perspective, normalizing the policy rate is necessary to address risks like persistently high inflation and further increases in household debt that could destabilize the country's economic outlook. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com) 

  0847 GMT - Citi's rates strategists expect Fitch Ratings to raise the outlook to positive from stable on Ireland's 'AA-' rating on Friday, as downside risks to eurozone growth have somewhat receded since the last rating update in July, they write in a note. Fitch's rating of Ireland is at par with that of S&P Global Ratings and one notch higher than that of Moody's Investors Service, both of which are on a positive outlook, Citi strategists say. ""Fitch recently lauded Ireland for its per capita GDP being above AA-median, favourable government indicators, 'extraordinary' revenue performance and expectation of fiscal metrics to continually improve,"" Citi strategists write. The 10-year Irish bond yield is up 1.5 basis points at 2.400%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0846 GMT - The European Central Bank will still need to increase interest rates by 50 basis points on more than one occasion in order to tame price growth, Dutch central bank's governor Klaas Knot says in a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""Most of the ground we have to cover, we will cover at a constant base of multiple 50 basis-point hikes... It will not stop after a single 50 basis-point hike, that's for sure,"" he says. Core inflation--which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy--is still elevated and recent inflation developments aren't compatible with a timely return to the ECB's 2% target, Knot says. Eurozone inflation slowed to 9.2% in December, and recent declines have led markets to slightly scale back their interest-rate-rise expectations. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) 

  0837 GMT - Base-metal prices fall in early trade in London, with worries over inflation and possible further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Three-month copper prices are down 0.6% to $9,231.50 a metric ton while aluminum is 0.4% lower at $2,606 a ton. Gold, meanwhile, is 0.3% higher to $1,912 a troy ounce. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard backed rapidly raising the fed-funds rate above 5% to prevent a resurgence of inflationary pressures, believing inflation would not fall back as quickly as the market expects--something that is fueling pessimism, according to Marex's Ruishu Hong. The analyst says in a note that Chinese passenger sales growth may also struggle this year, though subsidies for electric vehicles may be introduced. (yusuf.khan@wsj.com) 

  0836 GMT - Thursday's auction of GBP1.1 billion in the 0.125% August 2031 index-linked gilt should go ""relatively well,"" RBC analysts say in a note. Demand should be supported given the cheapening of the bond and the lack of supply of index-linked gilts with a maturity of less than 20 years for at least another 11 weeks. Wednesday's data revealing U.K. inflation remained high provides another supportive dynamic for the auction, the analysts say. (jessica.fleetham@wsj.com) 

  0834 GMT - The tightening of the 10-year Italian BTP-German Bund yield spread below the key resistance level of 180 basis points reflects a favorable environment for carry and yield accumulation, RBC Capital Markets analysts say in a note. Inflation is declining, interest-rate rises by central banks look to be coming to an end, and ""political risk has so far proved contained with the Italian government refraining from any major confrontations with the EU,"" they say. The 10-year BTP-Bund spread trades about 1 basis point lower at 174bps, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0821 GMT - The eurozone economy is likely to avoid a recession this winter on the back of lower natural gas prices, economists at JPMorgan say in a note. ""[The fall in gas prices] is a big deal for an energy importing region like the euro area, reversing a significant part of the income shock and sharply reducing the risk of forced gas rationing,"" they say. The U.S. bank expects the eurozone's GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 1% in 1Q 2023, swinging from the 0.5% contraction previously expected, and sees slightly stronger growth also in late 2023 and 2024. Inflation is also expected to fall quicker than previously anticipated, JPM says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) 

  0815 GMT - A report that U.K. opposition leader Keir Starmer will say he wants to improve U.K.-EU relations in a speech at Davos Thursday could have positive long-term implications for sterling, ING says. Starmer told the Financial Times that the post-Brexit deal is damaging the U.K. economy and his Labour Party would address this through closer trade with the EU. ""The Labour Party is leading by a rather large margin in the latest opinion polls ahead of next year's general elections and evidence of a softer stance on Brexit should benefit the pound in the long run,"" ING analyst Francesco Pesole says in a note. GBP/USD falls 0.2% to 1.2330 and EUR/GBP rises 0.3% to 0.8770. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0806 GMT - The Norges Bank is likely to raise interest rates by 25 basis points in a policy decision at 0900 GMT and this could support the Norwegian krone, ING analysts say in a note. The consensus forecast is split between a 25 basis-point rate rise and unchanged rates, ING analyst Francesco Pesole says. Resilient underlying inflation, growth and employment suggests this is right time to deliver the last rate rise of the cycle, he says. ""In line with our call, we see upside risks for NOK today,"" he says. ""EUR/NOK could trade close to 10.60-10.65 again today, but idiosyncratic EUR strength suggests most NOK gains may be channelled against the dollar."" EUR/NOK rises 0.4% to 10.7288 and USD/NOK climbs 0.3% to 9.9233. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0758 GMT - Concerns about a weaker U.S. economic outlook leaves the dollar vulnerable to data as markets continue scaling back Federal Reserve interest rate expectations, ING says. The fact that the ongoing repricing of rate expectations lower is not only a consequence of slowing inflation but also of a worsening economic outlook has ""exacerbated the negative implications for the dollar, especially as a positive re-rating of growth expectations is happening in Europe and China,"" ING analyst Francesco Pesole says in a note. ""We see more downside risks for USD in the near term."" The DXY dollar index falls 0.1% to 102.287 after hitting a seven-and-a-half-month low of 101.528 on Wednesday following weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales and industrial production data. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) 

  0730 GMT - Two of the three French government bonds, or OATs, on offer at Thursday's auction have underperformed their peers and offer value, Citi rates strategists write in a note. The French Treasury Agency will auction EUR9 billion-EUR10 billion in 0% February 2025, 0.75% February 2028 and 0.50% May 2029 OATs. The February 2028 OAT has underperformed the Irish 0.90% May 2028 bond, while the May 2029 OAT has underperformed the Belgian 0.90% June 2029 OLO, Citi strategists say. The third French bond on offer, the February 2025 OAT, provides limited relative value on the domestic curve, they say. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) 

  0715 GMT - France and Spain are expected to embark on government bond syndications still in January, following their eurozone peers, Ninon Bachet, strategist at Societe Generale, writes in a note. Several countries have already kick-started the syndication season, ""but we expect other issuers to come to the market, especially France and Spain in January with 30y and 10y benchmarks, respectively,"" she says. Front-loading of issuance in the first quarter of the year and a wave of syndications is usual and Societe Generale expects this to be the case this year, too. ""Issuers will likely try to front-load issuance in 1Q to secure funding amid seasonal patterns, and will use syndicated transactions to achieve size,"" she says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

  Regional Fed Bank Presidents Stress Fight Against Inflation; U.S. to Report December Job Market Data By James Christie 

  Good day. The Federal Reserve's short-term benchmark rate should rise to a level this year that it slows the U.S. economy as the central bank tries to cool inflation, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Thursday. Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that, ""I appreciate recent reports that include signs of moderating price pressures, but there is still much work to do,"" and Kansas City Fed President Esther George said she raised her forecast for the fed-funds rate to above 5%. Their comments follow an essay by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari published online Wednesday in which he said he expects the Fed to pause rate rises after reaching a peak rate of 5.4%.

  Top News Fed Official Sees Progress on Inflation, Says More Rate Rises Needed 

  The Federal Reserve's short-term benchmark rate isn't yet at a level high enough to sufficiently slow the U.S. economy to combat high inflation, but it should get there this year , a central bank official said Thursday.

  What If Inflation Suddenly Dropped and No One Noticed? 

  It defies credulity to think that interest-rate hikes that started only in March could have cut inflation appreciably by July, Alan S. Blinder writes, adding that there is an argument that monetary policy works faster now than it used to-but not that fast. 

  Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton, served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, 1994-96. He is the author, most recently, of ""A Monetary and Fiscal History of the United States, 1961-2021"" (Princeton University Press).

486,"The Fed and the Markets Disagree on Wages and Inflation. That&apos;s a Problem. -- Barrons.com

By Megan Cassella 

     The economic data released this past week appeared to tell a clear story: Consumer demand was falling, as evidenced by slower retail sales. Wholesale prices were cooling, suggesting that further inflation relief was on the horizon. The message seemed to be that the Federal Reserve's policy tightening efforts were working, and equity markets initially climbed on the data. 

     But then, Fed officials hit the airwaves singing a different tune. Despite abundant signs of economic slowing, they would remain steadfast in their pledge to hike interest rates in coming months. ""We still have some ways to go,"" said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell. Declines extended through Friday. 

     The episode was perhaps the most obvious example yet of the growing disconnect between Wall Street and the Fed over the most likely path forward for monetary policy. Markets have been watching inflation slow over the past several months and anxiously waiting for the central bank to pivot, worried that continued tightening means near-certain recession. But for the Fed, the welcome progress on inflation so far is simply in line with their forecasts -- and their forecasts also say that they still need to raise interest rates above 5%. 

     ""Financial markets are like, 'It's cool, but it's not cold.' And the Fed's like, 'It's not even tepid yet,' "" says Diane Swonk, chief economist with KPMG US. ""They're speaking different languages, even though they're both talking about inflation."" 

     That divide is likely to persist, or even deepen, as long as the labor market stays tight and wage growth remains strong. While inflation has clearly peaked and parts of the economy have begun to slow -- two factors boosting market optimism -- Fed officials are laser-focused on ensuring that price growth in nonhousing core services sectors is falling, as well, before they'll be satisfied that their efforts are working. 

     The Fed's concern is that even as goods prices deflate and housing costs slow, inflation will hit a floor well above its 2% target, due to persistent strength in those ""supercore"" services. And because of the way that labor costs affect service prices, Fed officials have zeroed in on wages as a way to gauge whether their fears are coming true. 

     Some market participants have questioned that approach, arguing that wages were pushed higher by Covid price shocks and will resolve on their own without the Fed forcing a rise in unemployment. Others took recent progress in average hourly earnings in December's jobs report as a sign that, alongside broader economic cooling, the labor problem was easing. 

     The Fed isn't convinced. Other signs of progress in the inflation fight are just window dressing until labor demand and supply fall back into line. ""It's one piece of the inflation puzzle that hasn't really fallen into place fully yet,"" says Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. 

     The longer the market discounts the importance that the Fed places on wages, the harder the bank's job becomes. By its own standards, the Fed has been fairly forthcoming about this, warning that any ""unwarranted easing"" in financial markets in response to policy changes would complicate the path forward. If souring economic data spark a rally due to widespread anticipation that the end of rate hikes is near, it could force a somewhat backward outcome: further tightening and, in turn, a higher risk of a harder landing. 

     ""The Fed can't afford for the financial markets to get too far ahead of them right now,"" Swonk says, adding that such a dynamic heightens the possibility of prematurely reflating the economy. ""They know what history tells them, and that's not a risk they're willing to take."" 

     The old mantra of ""don't fight the Fed"" still rings true. But this time, it's because failing to recognize the central bank's path forward risks worse fallout for everyone.

487,"Mondelez Expects Fewer Price Increases This Year -- WSJ

  By Jaewon Kang and Kathryn Hardison 

 

     Mondelez International Inc. said its costs remain high, though the snack and candy producer doesn't anticipate boosting prices for its products at the same level as in 2022. 

     Chicago-based Mondelez, which makes Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers, said it has raised its prices because of higher costs of energy, transportation and labor. The company said it increased prices in the U.S. in December and is negotiating in Europe. 

     Mondelez Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put said if the company's costs remain steady, as they generally have been over the past couple of months, it isn't likely to raise prices further in the U.S. 

     ""We hope those costs will start to come down in the second half of the year,"" he said. 

     The company, which also makes Sour Patch Kids candy and Toblerone, said Tuesday that sales climbed 14% to $8.7 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Despite the higher prices, people bought more sweets and candies across all regions except for Europe, the company said. 

     ""Price points, yes, they've gone up, but they are still acceptable,"" Mr. Van de Put said. He said the sales growth showed that consumers think of snacks and sweets as an affordable indulgence. 

     Shoppers have been buying cheaper versions of food and seeking out deals on everyday staples like bread and cereal, but have been less price-sensitive when it comes to sweets and snacks, supermarket executives have said. 

     Across the grocery sector, the dollar value of sales remains higher from a year ago while the volume of products sold has been declining. Food prices continue to rise, though the pace has started to slow and some products, such as fresh fruits, fish and seafood, have become cheaper recently, according to the Labor Department. 

     Staffing has improved and the company doesn't have plans for layoffs, Mr. Van de Put said, adding that it will invest in its capacity in the U.S. He said he is monitoring whether a recession materializes, though he said that it might not be as bad as expected. 

     Mondelez said its quarterly sales benefited from recent acquisitions, including the purchases of energy-bar maker Clif Bar & Co., confectionary company Ricolino and baked goods company Chipita Global S.A. 

     Profit declined to $583 million, or 42 cents a share, from $1 billion, or 71 cents a share, a year ago, led lower by factors such as higher acquisition integration costs and unfavorable impacts from currency and commodity derivatives. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 73 cents, above the 70 cents analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. 

     Mondelez is building up inventory after production issues lingered from a strike in 2021, executives said on a call with analysts. 

     The company spent less on promotions in 2022 compared with a year ago, Mr. Van de Put said, and expects that spending to remain relatively low in 2023. Mondelez is selling more items and is trying to improve service levels to retailers. 

     Mondelez said in December that it would sell Trident, Dentyne and other gum brands in developed markets for $1.35 billion to Perfetti Van Melle Group, as it focuses on chocolates, cookies and other snacks. 

     For 2023, the company said it expects organic net revenue to grow 5% to 7%. The company projected high-single-digit growth to its adjusted earnings per share, before factoring in currency fluctuations. 

     Mondelez estimated that the impact of foreign exchange will weigh on revenue growth by about 1%, and adjusted per-share earnings will be hit by about 4 cents.

488,"Mondelez International 4Q Sales Climb on Higher Prices -- Update

  By Kathryn Hardison 

 

     Mondelez International Inc. reported a double-digit boost to its fourth-quarter sales, helped by higher prices for its cookies and candies, as well as added revenue from recent acquisitions. 

     The Chicago-based maker of Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers said Tuesday that sales climbed 14% in the recent period to $8.7 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $8.33 billion, according to FactSet. 

     Mondelez, which also makes Sour Patch Kids candy, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Toblerone, raised prices in the U.S. again in December as it battled higher costs. Executives said consumers haven't shied away from its snacks and cookies so far. 

     Chief Financial Officer Luca Zaramella said during an earnings call that the company expects another year of double-digit inflation, driven by higher costs for labor, energy and packaging. 

     Shares rose 1.6% to $66.50 in after-hours trading. 

     Other packaged-food giants, including Kellogg Co., Kraft Heinz Co. and Conagra Brands Inc., have also hiked prices, saying the moves are necessary to offset their own climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Conagra, which makes Hunt's ketchup and Slim Jim meat sticks, recently said it doesn't plan on taking more significant pricing actions this fiscal year, assuming inflation doesn't rise further. 

     Mondelez's quarterly sales were also led higher by incremental revenue from recent acquisitions, said Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put. That includes the purchases of energy bar maker Clif Bar & Co. and baked goods company Chipita Global SA, deals valued at $2.9 billion and $2 billion, respectively. 

     Profit declined to $583 million, or 42 cents per share, from $1 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year ago, led lower by factors such as higher acquisition integration costs and unfavorable impacts from currency and commodity derivatives. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 73 cents, above the 70 cents analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. 

     For 2023, the company guided for organic net revenue growth of 5% to 7% and for high single-digit growth to its adjusted earnings per share, without factoring in currency fluctuations. 

     The company estimates the impact of foreign exchange will weigh on revenue growth by about 1%, and adjusted per-share earnings will be hit by about 4 cents. 

     Mr. Van de Put says the company is making progress in its strategy to focus on its chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories. The company recently agreed to sell Trident, Dentyne and other gum brands in developed markets for $1.35 billion.
