In fact, he handed it to Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez last Friday, the Central Bank official confirmed. \n\n  In his short tenure, Rossi also reportedly lost favor with his own Union of the Democratic Center political party when the Central Bank printed 1 trillion australs this month, an amount that almost doubled the money supply. \n\n  That monetary expansion, which Rossi had pledged to quell, almost certainly will fuel inflation, which soared by 40% in December and is projected to increase by at least that much this month. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 22, 1990

\"makes the case for further declines.\"  It noted that the M2 monetary aggregate, the money supply figure most closely watched by the central bank, grew at an annual rate of 4.9 pc in the six months ended in June compared to a rate of 17 pc in January.  M2 includes currency and net demand deposits plus personal savings deposits and non-personal notice deposits. \n\n  Burns Fry said demand for household credit, which grew at a rate of 14.5 pc in June, and some generous wage settlements reduced the prospects for significant interest rate declines. \n\n  \"The strong dollar, weaker growth and the more favorable tone in the U.S.  money markets give the Bank of Canada the flexibility to shift to a more accommodative policy stance,\" said Bank of Nova Scotia economist David Rosenberg.  The central bank, however, is likely to resist any sharp declines in short-term rates because of its continuing concern with high wage gains.  \"The central bank remains concerned that the run-up in wage settlements will reverse the recent moderation in consumer price trends,\" Rosenberg said. \n\n  Gerard MacDonell, a Royal Bank of Canada economist, said the dollar, which was pushed higher last week because of declines in U.S. short-term interest rates, may come under some selling pressure tomorrow after Statistics Canada reports its survey of revised capital spending intentions for 1990.  MacDonell said that, while financial markets are expecting the Canadian dollar to reach 87c (U.S.), a weak spending intentions report could \"damage the Canadian dollar by provoking speculation of a rapid cut in Canadian short-term interest rates.\" \n\n  Michael Gregory, another Royal Bank economist, predicted that the revised capital spending intentions figure would be down significantly from the 7.4-pc increase forecast in the March survey.  Gregory said a strong Canadian dollar, declining profitability and lower equity prices and capacity utilization rates indicate the revised investment figure will show about a 2-pc increase. \n\n

gotten the word about the tottering economy. \n\n  The consumer price index in July rose 0.4%, the Labor Department reported this morning. The CPI component excluding food and energy, the so-called core rate of inflation, was up an alarming 0.6% in the month. \n\n  A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists had looked for a 0.3% rise in the CPI and for a similar rise without the food and energy components. \n\n  Inflation reports in the next few months are likely to show sizable increases because of the rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. \n\n  Labor said the July CPI report didn't reflect the impact of the Mideast crisis. In fact, consumer energy prices were down 0.7% in July. \n\n  \"It underscores the fact inflation is not going to vanish meekly from the scene despite all the clamor about a soft economy,\" says Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. \n\n  Roach says his calculations show core inflation up at a 5.9% annual rate through the first seven months of 1990, compared with a 4.7% rate for the first seven months in 1989. \n\n  \"The sharp rise in core inflation reflects an economy that is clearly sending some ominous signals ... even before we deal with a full-blown energy crisis,\" he says. \n\n  John Williams, economist at Bankers Trust Co., says, \"The way to explain it, is it's alarming.\" \n\n  \"When you consider that energy prices were down in this report and when you consider that's not likely to happen again soon, the prospects for inflation are not very rosy at the moment,\" Williams says. \n\n  The consumer price index for July continues to show the difficulty in reining in medical costs, which are more or less impervious to supply and demand forces. \n\n  Medical costs showed the sharpest rise among major CPI components in July, leaping 0.9% after rising 0.7% in June and 0.8% in May. \n\n  \"We've got to find a way to get a handle on medical costs,\" says Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. \n\n  Stone says much of the increase in the July CPI may be the result of higher local taxes, and thus may represent a one-time surge in the inflation rate. \n\n  \"It looks like some sales tax increases got to us in here, so that many of these items suffered a one-shot surge in prices,\" she says. \"The surge in tobacco prices is a case in point.\" \n\n  Tobacco-price increases due to tax hikes accounted for a large part of the increase in the \"other\" category of CPI. Tobacco prices, which were up 2.7% in July, account for about 1.5% of the CPI index. \n\n  In addition, new hotel room taxes may have accounted for the rise in \"other renters' costs\" that helped boost the housing category 0.5% in July, Stone says. \n\n  Noting that apparel prices and automobile prices fell in the month, she says the overall CPI increase was \"sharp but it wasn't pervasive.\" \n\n  Nevertheless, \"inflation is jumping to center stage,\" says Morgan Stanley's Roach. \n\n  He says CPI inflation surged in the first quarter of 1990, followed by a \"breathing spell\" in the seocnd quarter.  Now it may be heating up again. \n\n  The confluence of the Persian Gulf crisis and a robust inflation reading could well freeze monetary policy, says Bankers Trust's Williams. \n\n  \"The markets know that the Fed is as uncertain about the future as the rest of us are,\" he says, and would probably deem any bold move in changing policy foolish. \n\n  \"Don't just do something, sit there,\" might be the Fed's only choice, he says. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 16, 1990 10:06 ET (14:06 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.849276Z", "updated_at":

central bank of Lower Saxony, said there isn't much room for an interest rate increase in Germany because of the trend toward lower interest rates in other nations. \n\n  Hesse, who is also a member of the Deutsche Bundesbank's policy-making Central Bank Council, made his comments in an annual New Year's speech to bankers in Hanover, where the state bank is based. \n\n  An increase in Bundesbank's offical lending rates could weaken the dollar again, which should be avoided, he said. He added that higher rates would strengthen the Deutsche mark and exacerbate pressures within the exchange rate stabilization arrangement of the European Monetary System. \n\n  Despite the lack of room for a rate increase, Hesse also acknowledged there are \"strong attractions\" for such a move, including attracting new capital to finance Eastern Germany.  Higher rates also would help damp strong demand in Germany that could feed inflation and offest the potential inflationary impact of growing wage and salary demands. \n\n  Hesse's comments contrast with those of other Bundesbank officials.  On Dec. 30, Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said higher interest rates might be needed if the mark suffered because of reliance on further state debt to finance German unification. \n\n  Many Bundesbank watchers expect an increase in the Bundesbank's discount rate in coming weeks, possibly as soon as a scheduled Jan. 17 meeting of the Central Bank Council. The discount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 09, 1991 10:36 ET (15:36 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.849363Z",

-AP- A strict austerity program begun two years ago will be extended for another year or more because it has failed to fully achieve intended results, China's government said today. \n\n  The basis for China's economic upturn is still rather fragile, an official told a news conference.  Some problems are yet to be resolved and others are still far from being resolved, he said. \n\n  China plans in 1991 to achieve a moderate 4.5 pc growth rate in the gross national product, 3.5 pc in agriculture and 6 pc in industry. \n\n  At a national economic planning meeting last month, Premier Li Peng told the meeting that the Communist Party suggested the austerity measures be extended into a third year or even longer. \n\n  Implemented in the fall of 1988 to bring down runaway inflation, the program succeeded in bringing inflation from a high of nearly 40 pc down to 3 pc for most of last year, but economists are warning of a resurgence. \n\n  Serious stockpiling, continued poor industrial growth and a large infusion of loans despite budget difficulties \"might result in potential inflationary pressure,\" the government said. \n\n  By the end of last November, China's stockpiles of unsold goods had increased by 30 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. No total figures were released. \n\n  Official reports have said new loans last year totaled 250 billion to 290 billion yuan, the highest ever in the 40 years of Communist rule.  The loans were made at a time when the budget deficit was estimated at about 10 billion yuan. \n\n  The massive injection of credit in the second half of 1990 helped boost last year's industrial growth rate to the planned 6 pc, the government said.  But an official report yesterday said some enterprises artificially sped up production to meet the target, merely adding to stockpiles. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 10, 1991 13:25 ET

\n   By John Urquhart \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  OTTAWA - The Bank of Canada is believed to be on track to meet its 1991 guidepost for inflation reduction, official sources said. \n\n  The guidepost requires that the rise in the consumer price index by the end of this year be held to less than 4 pc from a year earlier after adjustment for indirect taxes, including a 7 pc goods and service tax introduced Jan.  1. \n\n  The Bank of Canada set only a provisional inflation benchmark for this year because of the price impact of the new value-added tax.  The government has estimated that the new levy will push up consumer prices by an additional 1 1/4 pc this year. \n\n  The sources said that after eliminating the estimated impact of the new GST tax and other new indirect taxes, they were reasonably confident that the 1991 inflation guidepost would be reached.  The central bank is expected to announce later this year its estimates of the 1991 price impact of the various new indirect taxes imposed by the federal and provincial governments. \n\n  The Bank of Canada's formal inflation reduction targets, announced with the Finance Department in late February, call for the rise in the consumer price index to be held to 3 pc by the end of 1992, 2.5 pc by mid-1994 and 2 pc by the end of 1995.  Thereafter, the objective would be further reductions in inflation until price stability is achieved. \n\n  The sources said the Bank of Canada remains concerned about the potential inflationary impact of Canadian wage settlements.  Major wage contracts negotiated in the first quarter provided an average annual base rate increase of 6.2 pc, up from 5.9 pc in the 1990 fourth quarter. \n\n  The sources predicted that the level of wage settlements would drop before long.  In the 1981-82 recession, wage settlements showed a sharp decline after four quarters of economic decline, they noted.  The current recession is now in its fifth quarter. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 27, 1991 15:41 ET (19:41 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.849529Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-23T23:36:50.259781Z", "inner_id": 6, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7639, "annotations": [{"id": 6724, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 267, "end": 282, "text": "economic growth", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "567584", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 673, "end": 698, "text": "short-term interest rates", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "938620", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 719, "end": 740, "text": "long-term bond market", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "857813", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 803, "end": 812, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "874154", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1025, "end": 1037, "text": "money supply", "labels": ["Supply (residual)"]}, "id": "571754", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1048, "end": 1053, "text": "sound", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "464487", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1055, "end": 1070, "text": "monetary policy", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "730818", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1127, "end": 1138, "text": "lower taxes", "labels": ["Tax Increases"]}, "id": "395154", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1337, "end": 1346, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "558185", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1560, "end": 1576, "text": "short-term rates", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "414384", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 629, "end": 653, "text": "policy is limited solely", "labels": ["Mismanagement"]}, "id": "QvjgnvTwyB", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "QvjgnvTwyB", "to_id": "874154", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-23T23:39:25.693478Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-23T23:39:25.693504Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-23T23:38:30.202066Z", "lead_time": 149.929, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 12, "unique_id": "3844ba83-11c7-4085-be6d-2269f73ee2af", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7639, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2066, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2066], "data": {"inner_id": 84, "text": "Kemp Reported Concerned Over Administration Pressure On Fed\n\n \n\n  WASHINGTON -DJ- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, well known for his willingness to publicly criticize the Federal Reserve for high interest rates and an alleged lack of concern about economic growth, is now reported to be in the opposite camp. \n\n  According to Washington Post columnist Hobart Rowan, Kemp is currently experiencing discomfort over the degree of pressure the Bush administration, in which he serves, is putting on the U.S.  central bank to ease money. \n\n  \"Kemp explained to me,\" Rowan said in a column published today, \"that if policy is limited solely to achieving lower short-term interest rates, it will weaken the long-term bond market, threatening the housing industry, and raising the specter of inflation.\" \n\n  \"You can't inflate your way to economic growth,\" Kemp is quoted as saying. \n\n  In fairness, the \"supply side\" economic theories to which Kemp unabashedly subscribes, generally envisage steady growth of the money supply.  With a \"sound\" monetary policy in place, economic growth can properly be stimulated by lower taxes, Kemp and other supply siders maintain. \n\n  But in practice, Kemp has generally found the Fed off course in the direction of excessive restraint, allegedly as a result of \"excessive\" concerns about inflation among central bank policymakers. \n\n  Indeed, the Fed chairman with whom Kemp most frequently sparred was Paul Volcker, who consistently argued exactly what the HUD secretary reportedly now sees at issue: lowering short-term rates too far could be counterproductive if the long end of the market reacts badly to such moves. \n\n  Do the HUD secretary's currently views presage a shift in the administration's posture? \n\n  According to Rowan, Kemp admits to \"marginal\" influence within the administration on such matters. \n\n  \"If I were the Secretary of the Treasury, what I said would be really important,\" Kemp is quoted as saying.  \"But I'm not,\" he concedes with his usual splash of candor. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 30, 1991 13:05 ET (17:05 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.849633Z", "updated_at":

NEW YORK -DJ- Apparel and gasoline price gains are among factors seen boosting the Consumer Price Index by 0.3 pc in May, according to the average of forecasts of 16 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. \n\n  The core rate of inflation - CPI less the food and energy components - is expected to also have risen by 0.3 pc in May, according to 14 of the economists surveyed. \n\n  The projected CPI advances would be \"the biggest gains in the last couple of months,\" notes Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \n\n  May's consumer price data will be reported Friday at 8:30 a.m. EDT. \n\n  In recent months, CPI rose 0.2 pc in April, declined by 0.1 pc in March and advanced 0.2 pc in February. \n\n  The core rate, meanwhile, increased by 0.2 pc in April, rose 0.1 pc in March and spiked up by 0.7 pc in February. \n\n  Flanagan, who forecasts a 0.4 pc rise in CPI and a 0.3 pc core inflation rate increase for May, expects that \"gasoline \n\nprovided a supporting influence.   Food pressures, apparel, medical care and mass transit fees\" also likely boosted the consumer price measures last month, he says. \n\n  Overall CPI forecasts from 16 economists surveyed ranged from three calls for a 0.2 pc rise to four estimates for a 0.4 pc increase. Of the 14 predictions for the core rate, CPI less food and energy, there were eight estimates for a 0.3 pc upturn and six calls for a 0.2 pc advance. \n\n  Analysts at Mitsubishi Bank write that \"there is a potential for a large 0.8 pc increase in May apparel prices, which could edge up the core rate modestly to 0.3 pc.\" \n\n  They add that some of the expected apparel price rise would be offset by a relatively \"small increase in food prices following April's hefty 0.7 pc increase.\" \n\n  The April food price gains were \"heavily concentrated in the volatile fresh fruits and dried vegetables category,\" the analysts write. \"Fresh vegetable prices rose 15.4 pc in April due to adverse weather impacts in California and 'insect infestations' that resulted in some shortages.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 12, 1991 11:56 ET (15:56 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.849718Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-23T23:41:29.052660Z", "inner_id": 8, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7641, "annotations": [{"id": 6726, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 448, "end": 452, "text": "food", "labels": ["Food Prices"]}, "id": "457970", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 457, "end": 463, "text": "energy", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "578052", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2119, "end": 2133, "text": "Interest rates", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "810080", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2138, "end": 2156, "text": "corporate earnings", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "719473", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2301, "end": 2310, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "582709", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2514, "end": 2523, "text": "Inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "306345", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2632, "end": 2644, "text": "30-year bond", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "838750", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 631, "end": 641, "text": "recession.", "labels": ["Pent-up Demand"]}, "id": "ddfxh3nBbt", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"start": 578, "end": 600, "text": "inflationary pressures", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "VPRfRbrezn", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "ddfxh3nBbt", "to_id": "VPRfRbrezn", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-23T23:47:16.145099Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T10:46:13.534265Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 1548.789, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 10, "unique_id": "3c3911dc-4dc2-43f9-914d-063668c052fc", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7641, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2068, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2068], "data": {"inner_id": 92, "text": "N.Y. Stocks Rally On Late Programs; DJIA Up 21.02\n\n \n   By Craig S. Smith \n   Dow Jones Staff Reporter \n \n\n  NEW YORK -DJ- Computer-guided buy programs prodded the market higher late in today's session after stocks took a midday nap. \n\n  Share prices started the day higher as investors bought stocks after a key inflation report sent yields falling in the bond market. \n\n  The Producer Price Index for June fell 0.3%, while excluding the volatile food and energy sectors the index was unchanged for the month. Many economists had expected the index to rise, reflecting growing inflationary pressures as the economy lifts from the recession. \n\n  But stocks soon settled down as a number of weak earnings reports sapped investor enthusiasm.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which hit resistance at about the 2,975 issue in its morning, scraped along the 2,950 level through the middle of the day. \n\n  Trading activity had begun to wane when the program buy programs snapped stock prices out of their slumber, sending the Dow Jones average to its highs for the day.  The industrials ended off those highs with a 21.02 point gain at 2,980.77. \n\n  Newton Zinder, technical analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the market may be headed to restest its old highs in the week ahead. \n\n  \"The market was helped by the fact that it didn't collapse during the mid-session selloff,\" said Zinder.  He also noted that the number of advancing stocks held above the number of declining stocks throughout the day. \n\n  \"The market's breadth has held up very well this week, even when the Dow (Jones average) was down,\" said Zinder. \n\n  At the close today, 1,017 stocks had advanced in price, while 496 had fallen.  NYSE volume totalled 173.6 million shares, up from 157.7 million shares. \n\n  Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 3.28 to 380.25, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 1.62 to 208.16, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 2.92 to 354.81. \n\n  While the market may well rise back to the top of its recent trading range at 3,035, there are high hurdles to be cleared before stocks can reach new highs. \n\n  Interest rates and corporate earnings are regarded as the key levers that could lift, or drop, the market out of the range that has held it spellbound since February. \n\n  Fears that inflation will resurface as the economy recovers have kept long-term interest rates stubbornly high, while the slow-motion recovery hasn't yet produced the corporate profits that could spur the market higher. \n\n  Inflation fears subsided somewhat today, sending interest rates slightly lower. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond eased to just under 8.44%. \n\n  But earnings have yet to show any evidence of strength. Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder Peabody, said the market will have trouble making sustainable gains with profit reports arriving in force next week. \n\n  The final Dow Jones Industrial average close was 2,980.77, up 21.02.  There were 1,016 issues advancing, 499 declining and 553 unchanged. \n\n  Volume totaled 173,060,000 shares, compared with 157,680,000 shares yesterday. \n\n  The NYSE Composite index was 208.17, up 1.63.  The average price per share rose 28 cents. \n\n  American Stock Exchange volume totaled 9,290,000 shares, compared with 9,560,000 yesterday.  There were 308 issues advancing, 234 declining and 229 unchanged.

-DJ- Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said \"I think that the recession is over and that we're on the path to recovery.\" \n\n  Parry, in a speech at California State University, Fullerton, Calif., said the rise in oil prices and the Gulf War, which he identified as the causes of the recession, \"are largely behind us now.\" \n\n  In addition, he said the drop in interest rates since July of last year \"should add strength to economic activity, especially in housing and consumer durables.\" \n\n  Also adding strength to the recovery is the lack of an inventory overhang, he said. \n\n  \"We may be getting a glimpse of some of these effects,\" he said. \n\n  \"Economic activity was roughly unchanged in the second quarter, an improvement over the decline registered in the prior six months. \n\n  \"Although this isn't conclusive evidence, it appears that the economy expanded at a more robust pace in the third quarter just ended.\" \n\n  Parry's comments were contained in a text of the speech made available to reporters. \n\n  San Francisco Fed President Parry says the recession might not \"feel\" like it's over because the transition to expansion occurs at the bottom of the business cycle when levels of economic activity are low. \n\n  Also, the recovery \"so far has been concentrated mainly in the industrial sector, rather than in the broad services sector.\" \n\n  He says the recovery is likely to be moderate because of cutbacks in government spending, overbuilding in commercial real estate, and less credit extension from financial intermediaries. \n\n  \"Naturally, weak bank and thrift credit helps explain why the Fed's main monetary aggregate, M2, now stands at the lower boundary of its 1991 target range,\" he said. \n\n  However, Parry also said: \"It's too soon to tell how much the reduction in total credit is affecting the strength of the expansion.\" \n\n  Turning to inflation, Parry said the drop in oil prices and the strength of the dollar has helped stem the tide, \"although a good deal of this may be temporary.\" \n\n  \"Factors affecting underlying inflation are far more important for the long term. In this area, the situation is uncertain.\" \n\n  He said slack in the labor and product markets should restrain growth in labor compensation before long, but he added that \"we haven't seen significant improvement in the data yet.\" \n\n  \"Overall, however, I wouldn't be surprised to see consumer inflation of around 3 pc both this year and next,\" he added. \n\n  The Fed's Parry said he expected the economy to grow much more slowly than in previous recoveries, probably around 3 pc in the first year of the recovery. \n\n  Meanwhile, he said transition periods from recession to recovery are \"especially risky times\" for policy makers. \"For one thing, they're a time when signals often are quite mixed,\" he said. \"They're also a time when it's natural to be overly pessimistic about the strength of the recovery.\" \n\n  \"This may explain why there have been too many times when policy has eased well after the trough has passed,\" he said. And when the Fed has been overly aggressive in its easing of monetary policy, \"unsustainable growth and eventually painful struggles with inflation\" usually follow, he said. \n\n  Parry emphasized the Fed's role as an inflation fighter, saying that although the Fed \"should facilitate the recovery, (it) cannot lose sight of (its) longer-term goal, which is to control, and ultimately eliminate, inflation.\" \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  October 10, 1991 15:56 ET (19:56 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.850038Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-23T23:56:08.595868Z", "inner_id": 12, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7645, "annotations": [{"id": 6730, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 142, "end": 155, "text": "rental prices", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "276783", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 239, "end": 254, "text": "consumer prices", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "685469", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 612, "end": 619, "text": "heating", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "609457", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 654, "end": 668, "text": "cost-of-living", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "558091", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 730, "end": 744, "text": "cost-of-living", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "906912", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 842, "end": 858, "text": "price deregulati", "labels": ["Price-Gouging"]}, "id": "273159", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"from_id": "276783", "to_id": "685469", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-23T23:57:24.568954Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-23T23:57:24.568979Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 73.91, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 7, "unique_id": "bcd1b5c1-640a-491b-9b82-f493f30bf46f", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7645, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2072, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2072], "data": {"inner_id": 111, "text": "E.

But he said it must be cooled a little to ensure continued growth. \n\n  'Through the end of 1998, the economy continued to grow more rapidly than can be currently accommodated on an ongoing basis,' Greenspan said in prepared remarks. As a result 'some moderation in economic growth...might be required to sustain the expansion.' \n\n  The U.S. economy is expected to have grown at a 3.75% rate in 1998, resulting in the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history. That performance, bolstered by three Fed rate cuts, has stirred many Fed policy makers to warn that the growth could stoke inflation. Most economists, as a result, no longer expect the Fed to cut rates again this year. \n\n  Greenspan's testimony reinforced those expectations. Appearing before a Congressional committee for the first time since September, Greenspan said economic growth has shrunk the supply of U.S. workers willing to work who don't have jobs, a trend that could push labor costs up. Moreover, he said, the rise of U.S. stocks in recent months, which has contributed to economic growth, may be unsustainable. \n\n  'Everything he said suggested the Fed is going to be on hold for the remainder of the year,' said Josh Feinman, an economist with Bankers Trust in New York. 'The Fed has a pretty even balance of risks going forward: With the economy strong and financial markets stabilizing, the Fed wouldn't dream of easing (interest rates). At the same time, with inflation subdued, a tightening isn't on the table either.' \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 20, 1999 14:52 ET (19:52 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.850258Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T00:02:45.949126Z", "inner_id": 15, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7648, "annotations": [{"id": 6733, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 64, "end": 73, "text": "Treasurys", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "877561", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 269, "end": 278, "text": "Treasurys", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "662869", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1634, "end": 1643, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "211170", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1659, "end": 1665, "text": "2-year", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "193993", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1708, "end": 1714, "text": "5-year", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "934487", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1756, "end": 1763, "text": "10-year", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "937645", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1805, "end": 1812, "text": "30-year", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "740736", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1398, "end": 1422, "text": "the manufacturing sector", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "vCBueruUIQ", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "vCBueruUIQ", "to_id": "211170", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-24T00:04:38.939574Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T00:04:38.939590Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-24T00:04:32.387139Z", "lead_time": 110.949, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 9, "unique_id": "9dd1db1a-552d-4b74-8236-c3461b778b32", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7648, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2075, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2075], "data": {"inner_id": 132, "text": "U.S. Tsys -2: Investors On Edge Ahead Of NAPM, Payrolls\n\n \n \n\n  Treasurys stayed near their intraday lows for most of the session.

\n \n\n  The divergence between the 0.1% fall in the CPIX in the last quarter of 1998 and the expected 0.4% rise in the latest quarter was driven to a large extent by one-time factors which pose no monetary policy significance, economists said. \n\n  \"A lot of the latest rise in prices was due to food, which was drought-related,\" said Robin Clements, Chief Economist at Warburg Dillon Read (NZ) Ltd. \n\n  The food price index rose 0.8% in January and 1.1% in February. Food makes up around 18% of the total CPIX index. \n\n  The summer drought in some regions contributed to a significant rise in vegetable and food prices in early 1999, economists said, while hikes in tobacco and alcohol retail prices were related to adjustments to government taxes. \n\n  The start of the academic year, in which technical institute and university fees rose, also pushed up the general level of prices within the recreation and education subgroup of the CPIX, economists said. \n\n  Economists agree prices within the housing sector partially recovered after falling a dramatic 0.8% in the last three months of 1998. But views vary on the extent to which a strengthening construction market will have been accurately reflected in first quarter data. \n\n  ANZ Banking Group (NZ) Ltd. Treasury Economist David Drage said he estimates that prices in the housing group rose 0.6% in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. \n\n  Other economists, however, said they expect prices in the housing group were closer to flat in the latest quarter. \n\n  Merrill Lynch NZ Ltd. Economist Mark Benseman said central bank officials will be monitoring recent statements by electricity retail companies and local government agencies, indicating their charges will soon rise. \n\n  Yet, it is unclear at this stage how significant to the general level of prices such individual sector movements will prove to be, he said. \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  April

economic numbers and concluded that labor costs and other factors are likely to put upward pressure on rates. \n\n  The morning's reports included news of a stronger-than-expected 1.1% rise in employment costs in the second quarter, offset by a slowdown in gross domestic product growth to 2.3%. At least early on, the market focused on the employment-costs number. \n\n  By 9:00 a.m. EDT, the benchmark 30-year Treasury was down 27/32 from late Wednesday, and down 20/32 from before the release, at 89 11/32, to yield 6.08%. At the Chicago Board of Trade, the September bond futures contract was trading at 115-02, down 26/32. \n\n  The dollar was under pressure, too. For example, currency investors were retesting the euro's Monday high of $1.0724, the U.S. currency was also nearing Y115.00. \n\n  U.S. employers saw their labor costs rise at the fastest clip in eight years in the second quarter, as the tightest labor market in three decades is intensifying inflationary pressures on the economy. The 1.1% rise was above a forecast of 0.8%. \n\n  Second-quarter employment costs are up 3.2% from the previous year's quarter. \n\n  \"The number has caused a lot of volatility in the past,\" said Ken Fan, bond strategist Paribas Capital Markets in New York. \n\n  The long bond yield spiked to 6.07% immediately after the release of the data, from 6.03% before the release. \n\n  Yields of shorter-dated notes also rose. \n\n   -By Umberto Torresan; 201-938-2206 \n\n  umberto.torresan@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 29, 1999 09:20 ET (13:20 GMT)\n"}, "meta":

"Australia&apos;s Westpac Sees GST Adding 2.1 Pct Pts To CPI\n\n \n \n\n  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australia's Westpac Banking Corp. estimates that the introduction of a 10% goods and services tax will boost the consumer price index by 2.1 percentage points over the long term and cause third-quarter inflation to jump even more. \n\n  The government plans to introduce a 10% goods and services tax, or GST, in July, 2000, to replace the wide range of sales taxes it currently levies. \n\n  But to get the legislation through the Senate, where the government lacks a majority, it agreed with the Australian Democrats party late in May to exempt \"basic\" foods from the GST. \n\n  To pay for the cost of exempting basic foods from its GST, the government cut back on reductions of some indirect state taxes and reduced diesel fuel subsidies. \n\n  Warren Hogan, economist at Westpac Banking Corp., estimates those changes to the government's original broad-based tax will, in total, reduce the inflationary impact of the goods and services tax, or GST, by about seven percentage points over the long term. \n\n  The bank now estimates the GST will add 2.1 percentage points to the country's consumer price index over the long term, down from an original estimate of 2.8 percentage points. Most of the reduction is the result of exempting basic food from the GST, Hogan said in a research paper. \n\n  The government itself had estimated the original tax plan would add 1.9 percentage points to the CPI over the longer term. New government estimates are expected to be issued in December. \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 12, 1999 03:41 ET (07:41 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.850567Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T00:16:00.154447Z", "inner_id": 19, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7652, "annotations": [{"id": 6737, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 48, "end": 57, "text": "Inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "167947", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 87, "end": 96, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "641426", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 385, "end": 396, "text": "labor costs", "labels": ["Wages"]}, "id": "607161", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 409, "end": 427, "text": "productivity gains", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "324809", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 588, "end": 603, "text": "monetary policy", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "615547", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 698, "end": 707, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "126112", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 903, "end": 926, "text": "average hourly earnings", "labels": ["Wages"]}, "id": "317041", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 944, "end": 953, "text": "six cents", "labels": ["Wages"]}, "id": "278022", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1419, "end": 1437, "text": "Federal Funds rate", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "902228", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"from_id": "607161", "to_id": "126112", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-24T00:18:51.367204Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T00:18:51.367241Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 168.46, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 10, "unique_id": "2eb5fc72-160f-4a16-a692-20d0a17225e3", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7652, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2079, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2079], "data": {"inner_id": 160, "text": "Interview/McDonough-3: &quot;Attentive&quot; To Inflation Pressures\n\n \n \n\n  Turning to inflation, McDonough, who arrived in South Africa Friday morning, said he hadn't had a chance to digest Friday's batch of U.S. labor data - which analysts said was clearly inflationary. \n\n  Nevertheless, the Fed deputy chairman said the U.S. central bank had to be \"attentive\" to a situation where labor costs rise beyond productivity gains. \n\n  Late this week, the U.S. economy was presented with clear evidence of this, through a series of government data. \n\n   McDonough refused to be drawn on the monetary policy implications of the most recent figures, but said \"by far, the best time to do anything about inflation is early.\" \n\n  On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said employers added 310,000 more workers to their payrolls in July - well above expectations of a rise of 206,000. At the same time, workers' average hourly earnings rose by 0.5%, or six cents, last month, higher than predictions for a 0.3% increase. It was the fastest monthly wage climb in six months. \n\n  The set of figures followed data showing a softening in productivity improvement. \n\n  Global markets were spooked Friday by these

The Wall Street Journal \n\n  WASHINGTON -- Producer prices fell in October for the first time in eight months, but underlying the good news were some potentially troublesome trends. \n\n  The Labor Department said the producer-price index declined 0.1% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, helped by big drops in food and energy costs. But the so-called core rate of prices, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, was up by 0.3%, a lot more than the 0.1% economists had projected. \n\n  That number was affected largely by big one-month increases for autos (1.1%) and prescription drugs (1.2%). Although observers in both industries said the jumps likely were exaggerated by statistical factors, some economists couldn't help but suspect that real-world price pressures also are at work. That could draw the attention of Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet Tuesday to decide whether the hot U.S. economy needs an interest-rate increase to cool off. \n\n  Of the two widely noted factors in yesterday's numbers, the drug-price increase attracted more attention, because of recent drug-industry merger activity as well as the political heat being generated by the issue. \n\n  On Tuesday, the House Democratic leadership and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton held a Capitol Hill rally to tout President Clinton's proposed prescriptiondrug benefit for Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and the disabled. In addition, some consumer advocates worry about the possible impact of growing concentration in the industry. \n\n  Several analysts noted that drug companies often implement price increases toward the end of the year, in hopes of affecting orders placed for the new calendar year. In addition, the analysts noted that some new drugs with fewer side effects are being priced at significant premiums. \n\n  The analysts added that some genericdrug makers have been more aggressive about raising prices in recent years, a trend that could have contributed to the October drug-price jump. The drug categories that saw the largest increases include some with a significant generic-drug presence, including hormones (5.3%), antiarthritics (4.5%), analgesics (2.6%), and dermatologicals (2.5%), said William Snyders, a Labor Department economist. \n\n  Still, several industry analysts viewed the October drug-price jump as an anomaly. In general, price increases in recent months \"are nothing different than what we've seen the last four-five years,\" said Hemant Shah, pharmaceuticals analyst for HKS & Co. \n\n  The increase in auto prices appeared to be affected in part by record-breaking demand for cars this year, analysts said. That put more year-2000 models into the sales mix as soon as they were available, said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, McLean, Va. \n\n  From October 1998 to October 1999, prices for new cars are up only 0.3% on a nonseasonally adjusted basis, he said. The producer-price report reflects \"an anomaly in the inventory of new cars,\" Mr. Taylor said. \n\n  A record total of 16.8 million units (cars and light trucks) are likely to be sold in the U.S. in 1999, Mr. Taylor said. The old record of 16.04 million units was set in 1986. \n\n  David Littman, chief economist at Comerica Inc. in Detroit, also pointed to the weakening dollar as a key factor, as it makes foreign cars more expensive in the U.S. \"Competition remains a restraining factor, but nothing is more powerful than a reversal of the strengthening dollar,\" he said. \n\n  But major foreign auto makers insist the fierce pricing battles in the marketplace mean they have little room to pass the effect of a weaker dollar on to consumers. \n\n  The producer-price report comes in time to influence Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Fed officials have said the producerprice numbers don't matter much in their decision-making about interest rates because they are so much narrower than the consumer-price index, which doesn't come out again until Wednesday. Some economists said the PPI number will carry more weight this time. \n\n  \"The greater-than-expected rise in the core PPI has swayed our expectations for a Nov. 16th rate hike,\" said analysts at Warburg Dillon Read, Stamford, Conn. \"We now put a 60-40 probability\" on a one-quarter point rate increase. \n\n  Overall, the October producer-price numbers were a big improvement over September, when the core rate jumped 0.8%. Excluding the increase for autos and light trucks, in fact, the Labor Department said that the core rate would have been in line with expectations. Still, policy makers aren't likely to dismiss the auto- and drug-price increases as mere statistical noise, Warburg analysts said. \"We don't believe the Fed is going to play this game,\"said Joe Carson, a Warburg economist. \n\n  Analysts also noted that price pressures seem to be building further back in the producer pipeline. For example, prices for intermediate-stage goods other than food and energy were up 0.4%, said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C. Also, of the more than 60 core intermediate-stage materials, prices of more than two-thirds increased, he said. \"I see a continuation of the gradual but consistent upturn in inflationary pressures,\" Mr. Orr said. \n\n  Other analysts made much less of the latest report. Over the past 12 months, in fact, producer-price growth remained relatively tame at 2.7%. \"This is marginally negative news that shouldn't fundamentally alter inflation expectations,\" said Jay Feldman, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. \n\n  As for any rise in pipeline pressures, he said, that probably will take a backseat to recent statistics showing decelerating wages and accelerating productivity. \n\n  Adding to the picture of a bustling economy was a new weekly report on unemployment claims. It showed that for the week ended Nov. 6, initial claims were down 6,000 to 285,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. \n\n  --- \n\n  Gregory L.

McKinnon \n  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  WASHINGTON -- Evidence of inflation might still be scant, but the risk in November was enough to convince even the most reluctant Federal Reserve policy maker of the need to raise rates. \n\n  According to minutes of their Nov. 16 meeting -- which were released Thursday after the customary delay -- Robert McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, voted with all other Fed policy makers to increase the target for federal funds by a quarter point to 5.5%. Mr. McTeer had cast the sole vote against two previous rate increases, in June and August, based on his desire to test the economy's growth limits. \n\n  This time, according to the minutes, Mr. McTeer joined other policy makers who worried that the red-hot economy's increasing demand for workers could force labor costs to rise, while some of the factors that had held down other costs -- such as low energy prices and low demand overseas -- were turning around. \n\n  \"On balance . . . the unsustainable pace of economic expansion along with the reversal of factors that previously had held down overall price increases suggested a significant risk that inflation would strengthen over time given prevailing financial conditions,\" the minutes say. \n\n  Against that background, all the members supported \"a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy\"the minutes say. \n\n  The officials also expressed \"broad agreement\" on \"tentative recommendations\" to change post-meeting statements of the policy-making committee concerning its \"bias\" on the direction of interest rates, though the minutes don't mention any specific proposals. The Fed has been issuing such statements since May, but critics say they're confusing. Fed policy makers are expected to clarify their procedures regarding the statements before their next meeting in February. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  December 27, 1999 00:13 ET (05:13

Prices Tame In November\n\n \n  By Sarah Lueck \n  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal \n\n  WASHINGTON -- Wholesale prices rose moderately last month, despite a sharp jump in energy prices, further evidence that inflation pressures remain tame. \n\n  The producer-price index rose 0.2% in November compared with the previous month, the Labor Department said Friday. But energy prices climbed 1.8%. Food prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.1%. Overall producer prices jumped 2.7% compared with November 1998. \n\n  The so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, was flat for the month. Since the core rate is often what economists examine when trying to predict the scope of price pressures, they took Friday's report as another sign that Federal Reserve policy makers won't raise interest rates when they meet Dec. 21. \n\n  \"It will suggest to officials that although inflation risks are on the high side, we have not seen any stirring yet on that front,\" said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. \n\n  Even before Friday's report was released, analysts had predicted that Fed officials would be reluctant to raise interest rates this month because of concerns about possible Y2K-related glitches. \"The Fed probably prefers to stay on the sidelines,\" said Jeffrey Palma, economist at Warburg Dillon Read, Stamford, Conn. But Fed officials may switch their so-called bias -- their declaration of which way they are leaning on interest-rate policy -- toward tightening, he said. \n\n  Mr. Palma also said Fed policy makers will give more weight to upcoming reports on retail sales and consumer prices than to Friday's producer-price data. \"So far, consumer and producer prices have been very well behaved,\" he said. \n\n  Many finished goods that caused concern in the October report showed smaller increases in November. Prices for passenger cars, for example, rose 0.2% after a 1.1% increase in October. Prescription drugs, light trucks and household furniture all fell in November after rising the previous month. Durable manufacturing materials rose 0.2% last month after a 0.6% increase the previous month. \n\n  For all the good news, the new report contained some evidence of price pressure. Prices of intermediate goods rose 0.3% for the third month in a row, while crude-goods prices rose 4% after falling 1.6% the previous month. \n\n  As for energy prices, intermediate energy goods rose 1.8% in November, after increasing just 0.2% in October. Crude energy materials shot up 8.8% last month, after falling 4.8% the previous month. Electric power rose 0.7% and liquefied petroleum gas jumped 2.3%. \n\n  Even when the more volatile sectors are excluded, producer prices are inching up. The core rate of inflation for finished goods was up 1.9% for the 12 months ended in November, compared with an increase of 1.7% for the 12 months ended in October. Among finished-goods prices, eggs rose 22% last month following a 16.3% drop in October. Passenger-car radial tires rose 3.6% in November after a 2.5% decline the previous month. \n\n  Mr. Moran sees higher inflation on the horizon. \"You're seeing some important changes take place-foreign economies are improving, which will lift demand all over the world,\" he said. \"You could see the inflation rate in the U.S. creep higher.\" \n\n  Meanwhile, although consumers remain positive about the economy, their enthusiasm appears to be slipping from recent highs. The University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment decreased to 104.2 in November from 107.2 the previous month. The mid-December index for consumer expectations declined to 100.2 from 101.0 in November. \n\n  --- \n\n                    PRODUCER PRICES \n \n  Here are the Labor Department's producer-price

Thomas Sims \n  Staff Reporter \n\n  FRANKFURT -- Unfazed by falling stock markets, the European Central Bank, as expected, left interest rates steady because the bank still detects some inflation risks. \n\n  The ECB didn't explain the decision taken at a regular policy meeting, but recent comments from officials indicate the ECB still fears workers may demand higher wages that could stoke inflation. The trickle-down effect on consumer prices from last year's oil-price increase and a weaker euro still concerns the ECB, as does increased government spending. \n\n  Unlike in the U.S., dramatic falls in European share prices have little bearing on the broader economy here. European firms don't rely as heavily on stock markets for financing. Stock market capitalization in Europe is only 66% of ouput, half the level of the U.S., according to ECB figures. \n\n  European households don't have that much money invested in the stock market either. German households' equity holdings, as a percentage of disposable income, are five times less than for U.S. households, a working paper for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says. A 20% fall in share prices would only knock 0.1 of a percentage point off output in Germany, France, and Italy - eight times less than the effect of such a stock fall in the U.S. \n\n  \"The macroeconomic impact of movements in the stock exchanges is much more limited indeed than in the U.S.,\" Wim Duisenberg, the ECB president, said last week. \n\n  The ECB has been the only major central bank in the world not to ease borrowing costs, with growth slowing nearly everywhere. Over the past two months, however, the ECB has admitted that inflation risks are deteriorating, but some caution is necessary and justifies a wait-and-see policy. This has caused economists to expect the ECB to cut interest rates in the second quarter of this year. \n\n  Inflation reports from France, Germany and Spain earlier this week suggest annual inflation quickened in February after a two-month slowdown to perhaps as much as 2.6%, well above the 2% maximum rate the ECB permits. The European Union issues the report Friday. Oil, meat and tobacco were behind the price increases in those countries. \n\n  Unlike the U.S. and Japan, the euro-zone economy is showing only moderate signs of slowing. The ECB expects growth to slow to just under 3% this year from about 3.4% last year. \n\n  Confirming views of a slowdown, Italian industrial production in January fell a seasonally adjusted 1.8% from December, according to government report Thursday. \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 16, 2001 00:31 ET (05:31 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.851099Z", "updated_at":

consumer price index slowed in May thanks to an easing in food inflation. \n\n  But the deceleration was partly offset by a pickup in transportation costs. \n\n  The government-run IBGE statistics institute Tuesday said the IPCA Broad Consumer Price Index advanced 0.41% in May, compared with a 0.58% increase in April. \n\n  According to a Dow Jones Newswires' survey of 15 economists, the average forecast pointed to a 0.41% rise in the IPCA Broad Consumer Price Index in May. Projections ranged from increases of between 0.21% to 0.45%. \n\n  The May figure put the 12-month inflation rate at 7.04% and the year-to-date increase at 2.42%. \n\n  The easing in food price inflation is on the back of the arrival of crops on the market following harvest, combined with a drop in beef prices on the market following a series of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the southern prime cattle-raising state of Rio Grande do Sul. \n\n  IBGE said food prices in May rose 0.58%, compared with an increase of 1.80% in April. The turnaround in food price inflation comes after months of pressure from the category on the overall index. \n\n  The slowdown in the May rate, though, was partly offset by the city of Sao Paulo boosting bus fares by 22% last month, the IBGE said. \n\n  Despite the easing in the pace of inflation, the matter continues to be a big concern as Latin America's biggest nation now deals with a six-month electricity rationing plan that is likely to cut into economic growth and push prices higher. The rationing program, which started June 1, requires industry, commerce and retail users to cut electricity use by an average 20% a month. \n\n  The slowdown in May comes ahead of electricity distributors raising fees between June and July and that this factor, combined with high international oil prices and the sharp depreciation of the local currency, is expected to drive inflation higher in coming months. The weak real, which has lost some 19% of its value since the start of the year, so far has mainly affected prices on the wholesale level. \n\n  The falling currency is also making Brazilian oil imports more expensive and the energy crunch could also send housing costs higher, as the government plans to levy a surcharge on those consumers that fail to meet their energy-saving targets. \n\n  Opinion is divided among analysts over whether the central bank, which has a 4% IPCA target for this year, will further hike interest rates to keep inflation in check. The goal has a two-percentage-point leeway either side and central bank governor Arminio Fraga recently said inflation could reach 5.5% this year. \n\n  While some advocate more hikes as inflation remains a threat, others believe that more monetary tightening this year would be useless as the moves would only affect 2002 prices. Inflationary concerns led the central bank to raise the country's benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 16.75% between March and May. That reversed a two-year policy of monetary easing. \n\n  The hikes and the energy crisis are expected to shave between one to two percentage points of the initially forecast 4% to 4.5% growth rate for 2001, while also slowing growth next year. \n\n \n\n  -By Anthony Dovkants, Dow Jones Newswires; 55-11 3145-1478; anthony.dovkants@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 12,

NEWSWIRES \n\n  (This story was originally published Friday) \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The Bank of England are becoming increasingly concerned that different parts of the British economy are moving at varying speeds. \n\n  As trade figures indicated only too clearly earlier this week, exports are being hurt by the strength of the pound and the global economic downturn while imports are soaring to meet the insatiable appetites of British consumers. \n\n  The central bank has also been confronted with trying to insulate the U.K. from the effects of a global economic downturn by cutting interest rates, at a time when the housing market, retail sales and consumer borrowing could do with the opposite. \n\n  And if that weren't enough, the big public spending increases pledged by the government will pump extra money into the economy over the next few years. \n\n  During his annual Mansion House speech, the governor of the Bank of England Eddie George, warned that these imbalances can't go on forever and the \"elastic is likely to break - possibly through an exchange rate adjustment\". \n\n  And having recently deliberately stimulated domestic demand to offset the effects of the global downturn, that demand will have to be reined back, even though the momentum could prove hard to stop, he added. \n\n  While the governor also said that this moment is not yet here, it explains the rate stetting Monetary Policy Committee's reluctance to drop rates more sharply in recent months. \n\n  For Danny Gabay, an economist at JP Morgan in London, George's comments are a clear signal that interest rates will stay on hold at 5.75%. \n\n  \"His (George's) key theme was the twin-speed economy: external weakness and domestic strength - the latter partly deliberately engineered by the MPC to offset the former. However, in an emphatic statement of rates on hold, he noted that this policy could do little to offset external weakness, but ran the risk of exacerbating the growing imbalances within the economy,\" said Gabay. \n\n  The central bank's deputy governor also did much to highlight these imbalances during a lecture in Cardiff and, while mentioning that he was keeping an eye on creeping inflation, he did much to play down any worries attributing the recent rises to seasonal food and gasoline price rises. \n\n  The central bank is in tight spot. It faces rising inflation and an overactive consumer sector which it can do little to curb because of uncertainty still surrounding the U.S. and now euro-zone economies. \n\n  Furthermore, the political necessities of the current government could also make these imbalances worsen. The Labour Party was voted in for a second term with what Prime Minister Tony Blair regards as a clear mandate to improve public services above all. \n\n  Geoffrey Dicks, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland believes that government spending pledges will add fuel to an already roaring fire. \n\n  He looks back to 1987, the last time a Chancellor loosened the country's' purse strings at a time when consumer demand was strong. \n\n  \"The parallels with 1987, when a reelected government found itself having to deliver on election promises, will worry those on the MPC with long memories,\" he said. \n\n  Dicks notes how the Conservative Chancellor of the day, Nigel Lawson, was reelected on the promise of further tax cuts. Lawson thought the public sector surplus was structural and expected consumer spending to slow. In the event, neither proved true. \n\n  Dicks says that with public accounts in similar shape but, like the '80s, the economic resources aren't there. \n\n  \"The economy is operating at, or close to, full employment; consumer spending is booming on the back of Budget tax cuts and lower interest rates, though once again the Treasury is pinning its colors on deceleration which as far as retail sales are concerned are nowhere in sight,\" he said. \n\n  For him, the MPC has run out of room for maneuver. \"At some stage they will have to rein the consumer back in - earlier if sterling falls or later if the euro weakness persists\". \n\n  -By Gonzalo Vina, Dow Jones Newswires; 44 20 7842 9497; gonzalo.vina@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 25, 2001 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.851264Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T08:36:21.659886Z", "inner_id": 27, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7660, "annotations": [{"id": 6757, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 440, "end": 449, "text": "bad loans", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "110537", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1156, "end": 1165, "text": "bad loans", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "333405", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1302, "end": 1314, "text": "unemployment", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "537648", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1500, "end": 1504, "text": "debt", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "616219", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2850, "end": 2871, "text": "interest-bearing debt", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "543386", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3337, "end": 3349, "text": "bank bailout", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "942514", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3412, "end": 3426, "text": "terror attacks", "labels": ["War"]}, "id": "630399", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3616, "end": 3625, "text": "deflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "378501", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3807, "end": 3832, "text": "unsterilized intervention", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "570403", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3873, "end": 3880, "text": "dollars", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "157050", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4011, "end": 4036, "text": "unsterilized intervention", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "448149", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4106, "end": 4121, "text": "monetary easing", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "152822", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4155, "end": 4180, "text": "inflationary expectations", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "331415", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4418, "end": 4433, "text": "monetary policy", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "375590", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"from_id": "152822", "to_id": "331415", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-24T08:38:28.665815Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T08:38:28.665847Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 122.917, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 15, "unique_id": "91ab145c-16da-4fec-858a-e33943d1c730", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7660, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2087, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2087], "data": {"inner_id": 224, "text": "AWSJ(9/24)Japanese Govt Starts Crackdown On Bad-Debt Problem\n\n \n  By Peter Landers \n  Staff Reporter \n\n  TOKYO -- The terror in the U.S. has delivered a big shock to Japan, the world's weakest economic giant. But events last week suggest that Japanese leaders are beginning to see it also as an excuse to make tough decisions that will help the nation break out of its funk. \n\n  The government on Friday announced a new crackdown on banks' bad loans, which are at the heart of Japan's decade-long economic woes. The policy calls for tighter inspections of banks and more attention to \"market signals\" - a veiled reference to plunging stock prices and credit ratings of troubled borrowers such as supermarket chain Daiei Inc. \n\n  \"We will greatly tighten our assessment of assets,\" said Economy Minister Heizo Takenaka, who is Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's point man for economic reform. Mr. Takenaka quoted Mr. Koizumi as telling a meeting of ministers, \"We are in the process of achieving what was thought to be unachievable.\" \n\n  Such promises, of course, have been made before. In the past decade Japanese banks have consistently played down their bad loans, putting aside only minimal reserves even for loans to companies that were clearly on their last legs. Past governments, fearing higher unemployment and temporary economic pain, have encouraged or winked at this tactic. But it has left the economy overloaded with crippled companies too weak to do anything except go ever deeper into debt. \n\n  Mr. Koizumi might have an easier path than his predecessors, because he has made clear many times that his reforms will be painful and he still retains strong public support. The bankruptcy of retailer Mycal Corp. on Sept. 14, the second-largest nonfinancial bankruptcy in Japan's history, received favorable market reaction and little of the teeth-gnashing in the Japanese press that accompanied earlier big failures. \n\n  \"Barring strong public opposition, a bad-loan resolution looks more realistic than at any time in the past decade,\" Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., wrote in a note to clients. \n\n  Still, it's too early to say whether Mr. Koizumi can succeed, because many details remain unclear. The most important is how to use public funds to prop up the banking system. If banks conduct stricter assessments of their loans, many would have to record huge losses. Analysts say some banks could become insolvent as a result and most others will be undercapitalized. \n\n  Daiei, the supermarket operator, and some troubled construction companies are likely to be test cases of how sensitive the government is to \"market signals.\" Daiei's share price fell 12% Friday, closing near a record low after it lowered its sales and profit forecasts. Daiei has more than two trillion yen ($17.23 billion) in interest-bearing debt and virtually no operating profit to repay its loans. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's credit rating Friday to Caa1, which means Daiei's bonds are in \"poor standing\" and in danger of default. \n\n  By the twisted logic of Japanese politics, Mr. Koizumi will have a better chance the worse the crisis gets. History has shown that Japan responds best when under severe duress - the most recent example coming in October 1998, when parliament passed a bank bailout to stave off a near-meltdown in the financial system. \n\n  The terror attacks in the U.S. may have also handed the Bank of Japan an excuse to wriggle out of a policy that was drawing intense criticism. The central bank has long resisted radical measures to eliminate deflation but is now beginning to adopt some steps advocated by critics because of the deteriorating global economy. \n\n  Several times last week the Bank of Japan conducted what is known as \"unsterilized intervention\" in currency markets as it sold yen for dollars. Normally when the bank sells yen it \"sterilizes\" the transaction by removing an equal amount of yen from circulation. In effect, unsterilized intervention means dumping a batch of new yen notes into circulation, the sort of monetary easing that proponents hope will create inflationary expectations among Japanese consumers. \n\n  The central bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, is a staunch foe of easing but his position appears to have weakened, in part due to attacks from a vocal group of ruling party legislators. \"The last 10 years of monetary policy by the BOJ have been a total failure,\" says Yoichi Masuzoe, a former politics professor who was asked by Mr. Koizumi to run for parliament in July elections and won easily. \n\n  --- \n\n  Journal Link: What do you think Japan should do to boost its flagging economy?

Jones)--Canadian headline and core inflation rates are both expected to have continued moderating in September, removing the last obstacle to an anticipated half-percentage-point cut in interest rates at next Tuesday's Bank of Canada rate announcement. \n\n  When Statistics Canada releases the September consumer price index data early Thursday, monthly all-items inflation  is expected to have risen slightly to 0.1% over August's flat reading, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Standard and Poors MMS in Toronto. \n\n  But the year-on-year gain for headline inflation is expected to ease to 2.5% from 2.8% the previous month, while the yearly CPIX measure - the Bank of Canada's preferred measure of core inflation - is forecast to have fallen slightly to 2.2% from 2.3% in August. \n\n  In the current climate of global uncertainties and concern about the likelihood and timing of a North American economic recovery, inflationary worries have all but vanished from the radar screens of Canadian markets and economists, leading most to believe the September data will be a non-event. \n\n  Since rising energy prices caused headline inflation rates to spike to a nine-year high 3.9% in May, headline and core rates have drifted gently downward on a path that the central bank and private analysts alike believe will lead the all-inclusive and core rates to converge by the end of 2001 around the 2% midpoint of the Bank of Canada 1%-3% inflation target band. \n\n  Analysts said that despite another upward jump in gasoline prices in September, the broadly-based subsidence of price pressures in the energy component of the CPI should still exert a noticeable downward influence on total CPI in September. \n\n  'We're still seeing headline inflation coming down very rapidly because of the unwinding in energy prices,' said senior economist Adrienne Warren of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto. 'And core inflation really isn't doing anything right now - it's moving sideways, but I expect it will begin to drop lower in the next few months and into next year as the economy continues to slow down.' \n\n  Other analysts predict that another contributor to lower inflation rates in coming CPI data will likely be aggressive Christmas season discounting by retailers eager to boost fragile consumer confidence in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks and the unfolding U.S. anthrax scare. \n\n \n   BOC, Economists' CPI Forecasts Point To Lower Rates \n \n\n  All told, neither September's CPI data nor CPI reports in coming months are likely to deter the Bank of Canada from easing interest rates further to cope with the fallout from September 11 on an already faltering economy. \n\n  When it eased interest rates at the end of August, the central bank said it expected 'reduced pressures on production capacity and inflation through the rest of this year and into 2002,' and Bank officials have stuck to this view in subsequent statements. \n\n  On Tuesday, Bank of Canada senior deputy governor Malcolm Knight said in Toronto that the more pronounced economic weakening that has taken place since September 11 will keep inflation on a downward trajectory. \n\n  'World petroleum prices have recently been volatile, but assuming that on average they remain around current levels, overall CPI inflation should continue its recent downward trend,' he said. \n\n  Most economists have no trouble in subscribing to this view, along with its implication that inflation will be no impediment to continued Bank of Canada rate easing on Tuesday, and likely at the central bank's last rate announcement of the year on November 27. \n\n  Senior economist Marc Levesque of Toronto-Dominion Bank said that the September CPI data should be 'little more than a blip on the radar screen, given current economic conditions.' \n\n  'In any event, core inflation will remain close to the mid-point of the Bank of Canada's 1%-3% target band - leaving the Bank with all the necessary leeway to continue to cut interest rates,' Levesque noted in a recent commentary. \n\n

would put the euro in a new trading range of PLN3.90-PLN3.96, says BPH Bank. Many investors are seen waiting for the central bank's interest rate decision next week before taking new positions. \n\n  The zloty weakened against both the euro and the dollar Thursday, despite a strong start to the session by the Polish currency. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at PLN3.8995, from PLN3.8870 late Wednesday. The dollar was at PLN3.0050, from PLN2.9910. Trading was quiet, with most investors apparently done for the week ahead of the rate decision, which will be accompanied by the first commentary from the bank's new Governor Slawomir Skrzypek. \n\n \n\n  THE HUNGARIAN FORINT: Dresdner Kleinwort sees the Hungarian central bank cutting interest rates later in 2007, but says that risk is on the side of hikes before then. While the prospect of rates remaining higher for longer should ultimately prove forint-supportive, there is a risk of forint weakness in the near term, the bank says. \n\n  The forint weakened against the euro Thursday, despite a firm start. A trader said that Fitch's rating of Hungary's eurobond helped to support the forint early in the day. Rating agency Fitch late Wednesday assigned Hungary's EUR1 billion, 10-year eurobond a 'BBB+' rating. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at HUF254.85, from HUF253.35 early Thursday and from HUF254.30 late Wednesday. The euro came close to breaking through resistance at HUF255 Wednesday. \n\n \n\n  THE CZECH KORUNA: Traders see the euro continuing to rebound against the region's currencies Friday, following losses earlier in the week. \n\n  The koruna weakened a tad against the euro Thursday, in line with currencies across the region. There was little reaction to the Czech National Bank monetary policy board's decision Thursday to leave interest rate unchanged, in line with market expectations. Analysts expected the bank to keep its monetary policy on hold amid tame inflationary pressure.    In December, the country's annual inflation rate was 1.7%, up from 1.5% in November. The central bank's key two-week repurchase rate stands at 2.50%. Late Thursday, the euro was trading at CZK28.160, from CZK28.110 late Wednesday. \n\n \nFIXED INCOME \n \n\n  POLISH BONDS: Focus is on the central bank's interest rate meeting next week, with investors unlikely to take new positions ahead of this. \"We expect market players to wait for next week's rate-setting meeting and the new inflation projection of the central bank,\" says Calyon Bank. \n\n  Polish government bond prices were little changed Thursday, after a volatile, low-volume session. Bond prices strengthened early in the day, boosted by a firmer zloty and by weaker-than-expected German Ifo data. German business confidence fell unexpectedly in January, with companies' assessment of their current environment less positive than in December, the Munich-based Ifo research institute said. \n\n  By midday, Polish bond prices had recovered most of the losses posted over the previous two sessions, with yields falling across the curve. But by the end of the day, prices moved back, with yields towards the short end of the curve ending unchanged from late Wednesday. \n\n  Late Thursday, the average yield on the two-year bond was unchanged at 4.41% late Wednesday. The five-year bond yield was also unchanged, at 4.85%, while the 10-year yield was at 5.16%, from 5.14%. \n\n \n\n  HUNGARIAN BONDS: Volumes are set to remain thin and trading uneventful Friday, a trader says. \n\n  Lehman Brothers says the continued slowdown in Hungarian retail sales growth - demonstrated by data released Wednesday - is encouraging, suggesting that the government's fiscal measures have started to erode consumer demand. This should also be reassuring for the central bank, which is concerned about potential second-round effects of the expected surge in inflation, the bank adds. \n\n  Hungarian adjusted annual retail sales growth continued to slow in November due to lower demand for both food and nonfood products. \n\n  Regarding the upcoming appointment of a new central bank governor, Lehman Brothers believes Hungary's Andras Simor could be politically more acceptable than former central bank head Gyorgy Suranyi, who is also seen as a candidate. \n\n  Speculation continues about when the appointment will be made. The prime minister will announce the new governor after the ruling Socialist Party's congress Feb. 24-25, national daily Magyar Nemzet reported Thursday. \n\n  Hungarian government bond prices firmed Thursday, despite a weakening of the forint in late trade. Yields dropped across the curve. Late Thursday, the three-year bond yield was at 7.80%, from 7.92% late Wednesday. The five-year bond yield was at 7.50%, from 7.53%, while the 10-year yield was at 7.00%, from 7.07%. \n\n \n\n  CZECH BONDS: The market is likely to take a breather Friday, following volatile trading Thursday, says Ceska Sporitelna trader Petr Kaspar. \"In all I think there's now room for a little correction (in price terms),\" said Kaspar. \n\n  Czech government bond prices weakened Thursday, after spending much of the session seesawing either side of flat. Late Thursday, the average yield on the 10-year bond was at 3.90%, from 3.87% late Wednesday. \n\n \nSTOCKS \n \nWIG20          3398.87     loss    26.13  dn 0.8% \nBUX           24066.03     loss   151.9   dn 0.6% \nPX             1675.40     gain    15.6   up 0.9 % \n \nDJ STOXX EU Enlarged 15  3152.39 loss 28.16 dn 0.9% \n \n\n  IN WARSAW: Stabilization seems the most likely near-term scenario after losses Thursday, a trader says. \n\n  The WIG20 index ended down 0.8% at 3398.87 Thursday after massive profit-taking on a number of stocks took the market down at the end of session. TVN ended down 5.6%, while Prokom was down 4.8%, Bioton down 3.4%, BZWBK down 2.9% and BRE down 3.8%. Bucking the trend, KGHM ended up 2.2% in a rebound from recent losses. \n\n \n\n  IN BUDAPEST: Traders are downbeat about the Hungarian pharmaceutical sector after drugmaker Egis issued a profit warning Thursday. Egis blamed slack sales in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States for lower-than-forecast first-quarter profit. \n\n  Fellow Hungarian drugmaker Richter said Thursday that it sees no need to adjust its earnings projections for this year. \n\n  But Raiffeisen trader Akos Herczenik says: \"Bad news is coming from Russia and the CIS, exactly where Richter expects its largest growth potential to come from.\" \n\n  The strengthening forint will also bite into Richter's financial results, he adds. \n\n  A second trader called the profit warning \"very brutal\" and said there was \"raging pessimism\" regarding pharmaceuticals in the wake of the warning. Another trader said that the selling pressure could persist for days as both pharmaceutical stocks are rather illiquid. \n\n  The BUX index ended down 0.6% at 24066.03 Thursday as Egis and Richter fell in the wake of the warning. Volumes were high. \"The Egis announcement was the only negative news today but it set the tone for the entire market,\" the trader said. Egis ended down 2.4%, while Richter was down 2.6%. At this price, Egis shares are attractive, says Wood & Co. MOL weathered the day well, ending up 1.4% on the back of rebounding oil prices. \n\n  One trader said he expects the BUX index to continue falling Friday as \"MOL alone won't be able to turn the entire market around,\" with further heavy selling possible over the next two weeks. OTP ended down 2.3% as weakening regional currencies put pressure on the banking sector. \n\n \n\n  IN PRAGUE: With no significant scheduled domestic news Friday, the PX index is expected to track movements on core international stock exchanges. A correction is possible Friday, if U.S. stock markets weaken, traders say. \n\n  The PX index ended up 0.9% at 1675.4 Thursday. CEZ was the most heavily-traded gainer, ending up 1.1%. Among other gainers, CETV ended up 1.3%, Erste Bank up 1.3% and Telefonica up 2.1%. Gains were driven by a steady bullish mood, a trader said. Zentiva was the most heavily-traded faller, ending down 0.6%, as investors sold the region's drug stocks amid Egis-prompted concerns about slowing sales growth of generic drugs in Russia, where most regional drug makers used to enjoy solid gains. Other losers included Komercni Banka, down 0.6%, and Philip Morris, down 3.2%. ECM and Pegas, the index's newest members, both ended lower, down 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, in very thin trade. \n\n \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 26, 2007 00:52 ET (05:52

Pulizzi and Elizabeth Price \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n\n  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--China's policy of depressing the value of its currency pushes domestic inflation higher, and leaves the relative price of goods the country trades unchanged, the White House said Monday. \n\n  \"Chinese intervention does not systematically change the relative real prices between the United States and China,\" the Council of Economic Advisers said in its annual economic report of the president. \n\n  China has been under heavy pressure from Congress and manufacturers to ease its tight grip on the yuan, which critics say undervalues the currency and gives Chinese products an unfair advantage in global markets. China's central bank buys dollars on foreign exchange markets each month to control the value of the yuan, also known as the renminbi. \n\n  According to Monday's report, the increase in China's inflation rate, spurred by the intervention, offsets any price declines resulting from the exchange rate movements. That conclusion suggests the intervention may have little impact on the U.S. trade balance with China, and raises the question of why the U.S. Treasury is devoting so much of its time and energy to persuading Beijing to allow the yuan to appreciate. \n\n  \"Fixing the nominal exchange rate does not tend to move countries away from purchasing power parity,\" the idea that identical goods and services should cost the same in different countries, CEA said. \"The only effect is that domestic goods prices have to do all of the adjustment since the exchange rate is fixed.\" \n\n  CEA said there is no \"clear preference\" between conducting monetary policy with a fixed exchange rate or through short-term interest rates. \n\n  \"In the end, central banks that choose to fix the value of their exchange rate relative to another currency and central banks that choose to set a short-term interest rate are each choosing a different tool to conduct monetary policy,\" CEA said. \n\n  Though the panel said economic theory doesn't dictate a preference between the two systems, it said interest-rate targeting is the preferred tool because no major industrialized nation's central bank uses a fixed exchange rate. CEA Chairman Edward Lazear said the panel is \"agnostic\" on the issue. \n\n  \"Our goal in this chapter was simply to explain the effects of a variety of different strategies, and that's why we said we don't want to take a position on one over the other,\" Lazear said. \n\n  In July 2005, China officially ended its policy of pegging its currency to the dollar, moving to a system of managing the yuan against an unpublished basket of currencies. \n\n  Though the yuan has appreciated more than 6% since July 2005, U.S. exporters, lawmakers and the Bush administration believe it needs to rise further against the dollar. The Treasury Department is pushing China to let the yuan appreciate in the short term, and move to a freely floating currency regime in the longer run. The disagreement between Washington and Beijing is over the pace of reform. \n\n  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the White House's point man on the issue, told lawmakers last month that Beijing needs to take four steps toward floating the yuan. It must widen the currency's trading band, lower central-bank purchases of dollars, develop a bond market and create central bank policy targets to avoid inflation and boost confidence in the yuan. \n\n  \"China does not yet have the currency policy we want it to have and that it needs,\" Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee. \"China's cautious approach to exchange rate reform exacerbates distortions in its domestic economy and impedes the adjustment of international imbalances.\" \n\n  Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries, meeting over the weekend in Germany, urged China to focus on the trade-weighted value of the yuan. \"In emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur,\" the finance ministers said. \n\n  Earlier Monday, the Chinese government said the country's trade surplus jumped 67% last month from a year earlier to $15.88 billion. \n\n \n\n  -By Henry J.

FRANKFURT -- Historically, Switzerland's currency has been the strong, silent type: The tiny nation's steady economy and peaceful geopolitics have long lured investors to the Swiss franc in times of global economic turmoil. \n\n  But lately the Swiss franc has started behaving more like the Japanese yen -- a darling of currency speculators who use it to fund risky investments across the globe. \n\n  The reason: Switzerland's extremely low interest rates of 2.25%. \n\n  Currency traders are borrowing massive amounts of Swiss francs, then investing that money in countries like Iceland, where the money earns higher interest rates of 14.25% -- a maneuver known as the carry trade. \n\n  Switzerland's low interest rates are also luring individual home buyers across Eastern Europe and as far away as Greece to take out Swiss-franc denominated mortgages. \n\n  All this has Swiss National Bank officials worried. If interest rates and investor sentiment changes, these often-complex carry trades could sour quickly and roil the economy of Switzerland and perhaps elsewhere. Last year when Japan indicated it might raise its superlow rates, the announcement rattled global markets as traders tried to adjust their strategies. \n\n  Yesterday, the SNB raised its base interest rate by a quarter-point to 2.25%. The SNB targets a range for the three-month franc London interbank offered rate, and aims for the midpoint of the range, now 1.75% to 2.75%. \n\n  Low Borrowing Costs \n\n  Still, Swiss borrowing costs remain the second-lowest in the industrialized world, after Japan's 0.5% rate. \n\n  The low Swiss interest rates, according to the bank, are still stoking growth in the domestic economy, where annual inflation in February was zero. But the carry trade raises concerns that local inflation could start galloping higher. \n\n  That is because one byproduct of the carry trade is to weaken the Swiss franc compared with other currencies. A weaker currency means Swiss companies and consumers must shell out more francs for imported goods. (The carry trade weakens the Swiss currency because essentially, speculators are selling it in order to buy, say, Icelandic kronur; all that selling pushes down the franc's value.) \n\n  Indeed, the franc is hovering near eight-year lows against the euro. It has also fallen nearly 10% against the dollar since 2005, putting the value of one Swiss franc at about 82 cents. A weak franc is good news for Swiss exporters, because it makes their products more affordable to buyers in other countries. \n\n  There are also concerns that the currency speculation could destabilize economies in Eastern Europe, where the sale of franc-denominated mortgages is booming. The risk is that any rise in the value of the franc would increase the debt burdens and mortgage payments for people whose earnings are in, say, the Hungarian currency, the forint. \n\n  \"We've tried to say, don't assume it's always going to be this way,\" says Philipp Hildebrand, a member of the Swiss central bank's board. \n\n  In addition, Swiss-franc loans often offer floating interest rates, which means debt burdens will spike if Swiss interest rates do. Mr. Hildebrand noted that the franc recently bounced back a bit against major currencies as worried global investors unwound some of their currency bets -- a small warning of what can happen. \n\n  Market estimates of the yen carry trade typically start around $200 billion, and increase from there. Though experts say the franc trade is smaller, in part because Swiss interest rates are higher, few doubt that hedge funds and currency traders could lose billions of dollars if the yen or Swiss franc suddenly rose in value. \n\n  Pain of Franc Spike \n\n  A spike in the franc also could break many ordinary borrowers' backs. With interest rates in the euro zone and many Eastern European countries outpacing Switzerland's, banks outside the country increasingly offer loans in Swiss francs. \n\n  \"It's like a carry trade for the household,\" says Michael Saunders, a Citigroup economist in London. He warns that typical carry-trade investors are steeped in the complexities of currency risk, and far more likely to protect themselves when engaging in currency bets than ordinary borrowers. \n\n  According to the Bank for International Settlements, which collects data from 40 central banks, the value of Swiss loans granted to companies or individuals outside Switzerland rose to $138 billion in the third quarter last year, from $61 billion in the same period of 2002. Economists suspect much of that increase was accounted for by these so-called household carry trades. \n\n  Austrians, who have been borrowing in Swiss franc since the mid-1990s, held 34 billion euros ($45 billion) of foreign-currency loans last December. Several banks in Greece started offering Swiss-franc mortgages last fall. Both Austria and Greece belong to the euro zone, where interest rates hit 3.75% last week and are likely to rise to at least 4% this year. \n\n  Eastern Europeans with historically volatile currencies have also recently embraced the franc. Hungarian households held about 6.6 billion euros of Swiss-franc debt last December, a jump of 87% from 2005. \n\n  Much as Switzerland's central bankers might like to raise interest rates further to make the carry trade less attractive, they are limited in what they can do. The bank targets a medium-term inflation rate of 2%, and inflation is at zero. \n\n  The bank's most recent forecasts, released yesterday, show inflation nearing the 2% target again in 2009, and markets expect another rate increase to 2.50% at the bank's next meeting in June. But with interest rates in many major economies high or rising as well, the Swiss franc looks unlikely to lose its allure for foreign borrowers anytime soon. \n\n  --- \n\n  Dollar Rises Against Yen \n\n  In Bumpy but Tight Trade \n\n \n\n  Meanwhile, in New York trading, the dollar was higher against the yen in a bumpy but range-bound session that shadowed U.S. equities and paid little attention to a spate of mixed, second-tier data. \n\n  But investors, nervous over U.S. subprime mortgage weakness and the U.S. economy in general, failed to make any big moves. \n\n  \"There was limited participation as the choppy moves of the last couple days discouraged people from being overactive in currencies,\" said Sophia Drossos, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley. \n\n  Late in New York, the dollar was changing hands at 117.56 yen versus 117.07 yen late Wednesday, while the euro stood at $1.3237, up slightly from $1.3229. The euro traded at 155.59 yen versus 154.63 yen. The dollar was at 1.2179 Swiss francs versus 1.2158 francs, while sterling was at $1.9369, up from $1.9362. \n\n  --- \n\n  Dan Molinski \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 15, 2007 19:35

higher-than-expected in February owing to a sharp hike in education costs and due to a strong increase in the food sector as dry and cold weather damaged crops, the national statistics department, known as DANE, said late Thursday. \n\n  The statistics department said consumer price index rose 1.17% in February, while a Dow Jones Newswires survey of nine economists had produced a median estimate of a 0.90% increase of the index. \n\n  Colombian consumer prices were up 5.25% in the 12-month period to February. \n\n  The sharpest advance in February came from the educational sector which accounts for 4.8% of the CPI measurement. With the start of the school year leading to higher tuition expenditure and books costs, prices in the sector surged 3.94%. \n\n  The closely watched food sector, which has a 30% weighting in the CPI, increased 2.11%, as prices of vegetables and fruits climbed sharply in February. \n\n  El Nino warm current in the Pacific Ocean has caused drought in several parts of the country and night frost in the region around Bogota over the past two months. \n\n  \"The data is madness,\" said Cesar Tovar, analyst at the local unit of Stanford Group. \"The market was an expecting a maximum of 1%,\" he added. \n\n  Tovar expects yields on peso-denominated debt to increase Friday as a result of the higher-than-expected inflation figure. \n\n  He added that the data could comprise this year's central bank's target range of 3.5%-4.5%. \n\n  The central bank may be inclined to keep increasing rates at a faster pace as a result of the data, Tovar added. \n\n  On Friday, the monetary authority decided to hike its benchmark interest rate to 8% from 7.75% to tame rising inflation pressures. That was the eighth time the central bank has raised its benchmark rate since last April, when it stood at 6%. \n\n  Alberto Ramos, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a report Friday that if the Colombian economy doesn't show signs of cooling off, the bank could increase rates to as high as 9%. \n\n  Colombian inflation rose 4.48% in 2006, in line with last year's target range of 4% to 5%. \n\n \n\n  -By Diana Delgado, Dow Jones Newswires; 57-315-3088934; diana.delgado@dowjones.com \n\n  (Luis Enrique Hurtado contributed to this article) \n\n \n\n  Corrected March 2, 2007 14:45 ET

Jones)--Indonesia's inflation rate likely decelerated this month as the government managed to tame basic food prices, while stronger global commodity prices probably supported a trade surplus last month, analysts said. \n\n  Market-watchers will scrutinize the inflation and trade data more closely than usual as the central bank is seen as being at a crossroads on its rate policy. The Central Statistics Bureau is due to issue both sets of data around 0630 GMT Monday. \n\n  The average forecast of a Dow Jones Newswires survey of regional economists is for the Consumer Price Index to have risen 0.23% on month in March and 6.46% on year. Those projections compare with a rise of 0.62% on month and 6.30% on year in February. \n\n  The expected higher on-year inflation rate is due to a low base. \n\n  \"We expect to see a moderate level of inflation in March...as the prices of rice and sugar have been stable with a slight decline (in) the last week of the month,\" said Anton Gunawan, an economist with Citigroup in Jakarta. \n\n  On the trade front, the country's performance likely continued to be robust on the back of high prices and strong demand for oil, gas and commodities exports, analysts said. \n\n  Still, the trade surplus is projected to have edged up only slightly to $3.13 billion from $3.11 billion in January, the survey showed. \n\n  Exports are expected to have increased 13.05% on year in February, while imports are forecast to have risen 15.34%. In January, Indonesia's exports were $8.35 billion and imports $5.24 billion. \n\n  Given the likely inflation and trade data, four economists called for a 25-basis point cut in Bank Indonesia's policy rate when the central bank meets next. If Bank Indonesia keeps the rate unchanged, it will mark the second such pause since monetary policy easing began in May last year. \n\n  Bank Indonesia's Board of Governors will decide on possible adjustments to the benchmark rate, now at 9.00%, on April 5. \n\n \nFORECASTS OF INDONESIA MARCH CPI, February TRADE DATA \nINSTITUTION        CPI   CPI    EXPORTS IMPORTS TRD SURPLUS

weak against other major currencies, but Group of Seven finance chiefs aren't likely to focus on the yen when they meet in Washington later this month, a former top Japanese currency official said Tuesday. \n\n  That is because the yen's weakness is due to Japan's monetary policy settings and G7 officials don't usually discuss a country's domestic policy, he said. \n\n  \"The cause of the yen's weakness is clear - that is, Japan's low interest rates,\" Eisuke Sakakibara told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview. \"It isn't a matter of foreign exchange. It is an issue of monetary policy. Meddling in each other's monetary policy is usually avoided (by G7 officials). In that sense, (the yen) probably won't become an openly debated topic.\" \n\n  Sakakibara served as vice finance minister for international affairs between 1997-1999 and was known as Mr Yen for his ability to move the exchange rate of the currency with his comments. He currently is director of Waseda University's Indian economic studies institute. \n\n  His comments are in line with currency traders' expectations that the Japanese currency will take a back seat to other issues at the coming G7 talks because the dollar and the euro have slowed their pace of appreciation versus the yen after a global stock market selloff and temporary yen surges in late February and early March. \n\n  Still, G7 officials don't all agree with Sakakibara. \n\n  Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi said earlier Tuesday that he doubts G7 officials will discuss the yen, but his Canadian counterpart, Jim Flaherty, said Monday that he \"wouldn't be surprised if (the yen's exchange rate) was the subject of some discussion.\" \n\n  Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the U.S., Japan, Germany, England, France, Italy and Canada will meet in Washington, D.C. on April 13. \n\n  G7 May Warn Vs Yen-Carry Trades Again \n\n  Sakakibara said that while G7 representatives may skirt around the yen's value, they will likely repeat their warning made in February about yen-carry trades, a risky investment strategy that many analysts blame for the yen's persistent weakness. \n\n  \"The markets are continuing carry trades,\" he said. \"There's no question that the yen is abnormally weak.\" \n\n  For example, the euro's \"fair value\" against the yen is Y110.00 to Y115.00 based on Japan's trade competitiveness and other factors, said Sakakibara. That is well below the common European currency's current level of Y158.34. \n\n  As for the dollar-yen exchange rate, he said that given Japan's international competitiveness, the country's manufacturers \"can easily live with rates of around Y100.00 to Y110.00.\" \n\n  \"For the time being\", however, the greenback will hug a range of Y115.00 to Y120.00, underpinned by Japanese investors' appetite for overseas assets that pay higher returns than those at home, he said. \n\n  At 1000 GMT Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at Y118.60. \n\n \n   Bank of Japan May Raise Interest Rates Next Month \n \n\n  Turning to Japan's monetary policy, Sakakibara said the Bank of Japan may increase interest rates in May because the country's economy is in its \"best condition\", growing at a price-adjusted annual pace of around 2.5% while prices are stable. \n\n  \"I think a May rate hike is possible,\" he said. \n\n  \"To be sure, things would evolve differently if the (Japanese) economy slipped into a downtrend or stock prices make a nosedive,\" he said. \"But as long as the current economic conditions are maintained, a May hike would be nothing strange.\" \n\n  Sakakibara's prediction is at odds with consensus that the central bank will stand pat until after parliamentary elections in July. \n\n  \"The markets have been wrong recently,\" forecasting a rate hike in January, when the bank stayed put, while anticipating no tightening in February, when the bank lifted rates by a quarter percentage point to 0.50%, he said. \"It may be wise not to put your faith on the markets.\" \n\n  Sakakibara himself urged the BOJ to \"normalize\" Japan's \"unusually low interest rates\" and stop fueling yen-carry trades by pumping money into the world's money markets. \n\n  \"There're various opinions (on what levels constitute normal policy rates in Japan), but ... they may be around 2.0%,\" he said. The U.S. policy rate is 5.25%, while the rate in Europe is 3.75%, \"but growth rates of the U.S. economy and the European economy are almost the same as Japan's.\" \n\n  He played down Japan's lack of inflation, which he attributed to slow wage growth and fierce business competition in Japan - developments that are \"positive things\" for the economy. \n\n  \"It doesn't make sense for Japanese real interest rates to stay near zero.\" \n\n \n   -By Takashi Nakamichi, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; takashi.nakamichi@dowjones.com \n\n  -Edited by Iain McDonald \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones

pushed milk prices higher, creating another pressure on already hamstrung food companies. \n\n  Companies that churn out chocolates, yogurt, ice cream and cheese have begun to feel the heat, prompting them to warn Wall Street of lower earnings and ponder price increases. \n\n  Hershey Co. last week tempered its guidance for the year because of higher costs for milk. Dean Foods Co., which makes ice cream, Horizon organic milk and yogurt, earlier this month warned it would only meet the lower end of a previous forecast. \n\n  Dean Foods' stock price is off 25% so far this year, while Hershey's stock is up 5%. \n\n  \"We are increasingly concerned about rapidly rising raw-milk prices and industry estimates for continued increases through the balance of the year,\" Dean Foods Chief Executive Gregg Engles told analysts and investors in a conference call in early May. \n\n  A confluence of factors are propelling dairy prices higher. Prices for corn, which is used in the production of ethanol, have been rising because of a surge in demand for biofuel. The higher prices for corn, coupled with higher costs for soybeans and hay, have been making livestock feed more expensive. \n\n  There also are other forces in play. According to Chris Galen, spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, a number of food companies have been looking to buy milk produced without the use of the artificial bovine growth hormones known as RVST. While use of those hormones can help increase productivity, a drop in usage crimps supply, he said. \n\n  At the same time, demand for dairy products has been strong internationally because of a weaker dollar, strong demand from fast-growing Asian economies and a slowdown in the dairy industries of Australia and New Zealand, Mr. Galen said. \n\n  \"Demand is going to be very strong globally and that is going to push market prices higher this year,\" said Kenneth Bailey, associate professor for agricultural economics at Pennsylvania State University. \n\n  Class III milk futures, which represent milk used in cheddar cheese, have risen roughly 32% on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange so far this year. Class IV milk futures, which represent milk used to make butter and nonfat dry milk, are up about 26%. \n\n  Food companies have been grappling with a variety of inflationary pressures. Energy prices are off last year's peak, but oil remains above $60 a barrel. Most food companies have to raise prices for their products in order to fight the cost pressures. Prices for grains like wheat have increased in tandem with corn. \n\n  Kraft Foods Inc. said it increased prices earlier this year on some of its dairy-based products because of rising commodity costs. The company -- whose stable of brands includes Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft singles -- said it continues to monitor the market, and will adjust its prices accordingly. \n\n  Raising prices can be a difficult decision for food companies like Kraft, which are facing competition from cheaper private-label, or store, brands, said Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren. Still, he added that the rise in a commodity such as milk tends to be felt by private-label producers too. \n\n  \"If everyone is feeling pinched, it's easier to get pricing,\" Mr. Warren said. \"In this case it is probably likely everyone will be able to take some incremental pricing.\" \n\n  Food companies sometimes try hedging techniques to protect themselves against higher commodity prices. But commodity prices can be volatile and the hedging process complicated. \n\n  \"We did a very small hedging operation with regard to dairy about 18 months ago, but we couldn't get sufficient interest from a counterparty [for it] to be significant for us,\" said Starbucks Corp. Chief Financial Officer Michael Casey on a conference call this month. The coffee chain has felt the impact of higher dairy costs, and has said its outlook for the year takes those pressures into consideration. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 15, 2007 20:02

with comments from Central Bank govenrnor, finance minister) \n\n \n\n  BOGOTA (Dow Jones)--Colombia's Central Bank on Friday raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.75%, from 8.5%, in an expected move that was designed to reduce inflationary pressures. \n\n  \"This decision was taken after taking into account April's inflation, which came in higher than expected,\" the monetary policy committee said in a statement after its monthly meeting. \"Moreover demand and credit keep showing strong growth.\" \n\n  Ten out of 12 economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires before the decision had said they expected a 25-basis-point increase. \n\n  Strong demand for consumer goods accentuated by robust economic growth has put strong upward pressure on inflation. Twelve-month rolling inflation reached 6.26% at the end of April, well above the central bank's target for 2007 of between 3.5% and 4.5%. The bank reiterated at Friday's meeting that it is maintaining the same target. \n\n  \"Inflation is clearly outside the target and inflation expectations are deteriorating fast,\" Goldman Sachs said in a research report before the decision. \n\n  JPMorgan said it expects another rate hike in June and wouldn't rule out further hikes if inflation and inflationary expectations don't show signs of easing by the end of June. \n\n  Barclays Capital sees a similar hike at the bank's June meeting, \"after which we expect the central bank to pause,\" it said. \"The April spike in inflation to 6.26% makes a total of 50 basis points in hikes in the short term very likely,\" Barclays said. \"Nonetheless, the worst of the inflation surprises is likely behind us.\" \n\n  All three banks had forecasted a 25-basis-point increase. \n\n  Speaking after the decision, central bank governor Jose Dario Uribe said the 275 basis points of rate hikes since April 2006 will soon start to quell price pressures. \n\n  Uribe urged the central government to reduce spending, which would also help curb inflation. \"I reiterate that an austere fiscal policy will improve the efficiency of the Colombian economy,\" Uribe said. \n\n  Finance Minister Oscar Ivan Zuluaga said the government expects to end the year with total debt of 147 trillion Colombian pesos ($74.2 billion), unchanged from last year. \"Our spending is not increasing,\" Zuluaga said. \n\n  The central bank, meanwhile, said it believes measures it introduced May 6 will begin to take effect and contribute to promoting its monetary policy. The bank imposed higher reserve requirements on bank deposits and required 40% of the proceeds from foreign loans to be deposited with the Central Bank for six months without interest. The bank also limited the amounts banks and brokerages can invest in derivatives and hedging operations. \n\n  \"Next week, we will evaluate how the measures have slowed down the flow of capital inflows,\" Zuluaga added. \n\n  But the bank didn't take any steps to try to influence the currency at Friday's meeting. Rising interest rates, coupled with strong export revenue and heavy foreign direct investment, have driven the peso higher against the U.S. dollar, and some analysts had expected action to offset Friday's interest rate hike. \n\n  Zuluaga, who sits on the Central Bank board, stressed the sharp appreciation comes from foreign direct investment and not from short-term portfolio investments. \n\n  Late Friday, the Colombian peso was stronger against the U.S. dollar in New York trading, at COP1,979 per U.S. dollar, from COP1,985 earlier. The currency has gained around 13% against the dollar so far this year. \n\n  The sharp appreciation of the peso has already left 15,000 people without jobs in the textile industry and a 6,000 jobs in the flower industry, according to Zuluaga. \n\n  Zuluaga said the government will announce a subsidy package to help exporters early next week. \n\n \n\n  -By Diana Delgado, Dow Jones Newswires; 57-1-600-1980; diana.delgado@dowjones.com (Matthew Cowley in New York contributed to this report.) \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 18, 2007 17:30 ET (21:30 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.852128Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T09:21:05.233731Z", "inner_id": 37, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7670, "annotations": [{"id": 6767, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 169, "end": 179, "text": "Job growth", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "267230", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 374, "end": 383, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "427944", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 410, "end": 423, "text": "rate increase", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "859438", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 431, "end": 434, "text": "Fed", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "674314", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 627, "end": 632, "text": "loans", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "265849", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1050, "end": 1068, "text": "Ten-year Treasurys", "labels": ["Government Debt"]}, "id": "406527", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1105, "end": 1107, "text": "5%", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "296443", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1109, "end": 1112, "text": "Oil", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "543573", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"from_id": "267230", "to_id": "427944", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-24T09:22:36.580872Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T09:22:36.580896Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 83.119, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 9, "unique_id": "a632399a-bb66-43f2-8435-f05c74b60e90", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7670, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2097, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2097], "data": {"inner_id": 268, "text": "WSJ(6/2) What&apos;s News, Business And Finance\n\n   (From THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) \n\n  The U.S. economy appears to be regaining momentum after a slow start to the year.

Subprime, Data Worries\n\n \n\n  By Michael Wilson \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--Spreads on the European credit-default swap iTraxx indexes widened early Tuesday due to more concern about the U.S. subprime mortgage market and upcoming data releases. \n\n  Spreads had tightened in recent days following high levels of volatility last week, but a deterioration in the ABX subprime derivatives index overnight signaled that worries over the U.S. subprime mortgage market are still present, pushing European credit spreads wider again. \n\n  \"There was no conviction to the recent rally, and it now seems to have stalled,\" said a Dresdner Kleinwort analyst, who recommended investors take a defensive position. \n\n  The BBB portion of the ABX.HE 07-1 subprime derivatives index, which tracks credit derivatives written on subprime mortgages, lost four points Monday, hitting an all-time low of 45 cents. \n\n  Concerns over risky mortgage debt were exacerbated by two reports released Monday by ratings agency Fitch Ratings, highlighting the excessive use of leverage by credit hedge funds and the expected rise of defaults in the commercial-mortgage sector. \n\n  Unicredit said U.S. producer price index data, due at 1230 GMT, could also prove negative for credit, as an above-consensus result may feed fears that the rate of headline inflation is rising. \n\n  Continued high levels of inflation could prevent the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates, dashing the hopes of investors who believe that a fall in house prices will be halted by a cut in the cost of borrowing. \n\n  The iTraxx Crossover index of 50 weaker-rated credits widened during the morning session to 285/286 basis points from 277/280 basis points at the open. The index widened significantly overnight, opening more than 10 basis points wider from its 267.5 basis points close Monday. \n\n  The Europe Main index of 125 investment-grade names also widened to 29.5/29.75 basis points from its 28/29 opening level. The index hit its widest point of 30 basis points early Tuesday, amid \"good volumes of protection buying all morning,\" said a European credit strategist. \n\n  Single names moved slightly wider with the market Tuesday, but saw no real moves as worries about systemic risk grabbed the attention. \n\n  \"All investment-grade single names are marked one to two basis points weaker, but all the concentration is on the indexes this morning,\" said a trader. \n\n  The primary market seems to be in wait-and-see mode given the recent market volatility. A rise in the level of risk-aversion means that investors are now demanding a higher premium to hold risk, which is driving up the cost of funding. \n\n  Late Monday, Russian state-controlled oil producer OAO Rosneft postponed its two-tranche Eurobond issue according to the deal's lead managers. \n\n  Rosneft had been preparing to issue up to $5 billion of debt to refinance recent acquisitions, and bankers familiar with the matter had said it wanted to issue $2 billion-equivalent of Eurobonds in separate tranches and currencies, with maturities of five and 10 years. \n\n  Rosneft is looking to refinance part of the $22 billion of debt it took on to buy most of the assets of OAO Yukos at the company's liquidation earlier this year. \n\n \n\n  -By Michael Wilson, Dow

STREET JOURNAL) \n   By Joellen Perry \n\n  Frankfurt -- The global rise in food prices is catching up with continental Europe, adding to mounting inflation worries and forcing changes to European Union agriculture policy. \n\n  Rising global food demand, freakish weather and the trend to reroute crops for biofuels are pushing up food-commodity prices globally. Standard & Poor's GSCI Excess Return Index, which measures the price movements of eight agriculture commodities -- including wheat, sugar and corn -- is up 10% in the past year. \n\n  European shoppers are looking at some particularly stiff increases. Germany's Dairy Industry Association said earlier this month that domestic prices for milk-based products such as butter could jump as much as 50% this year. Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever said soaring global edible-oil and dairy prices will increase its costs by more than 600 million euros ($821.8 million) this year and boost prices for products such as margarine. Italy's Association of Pasta Manufacturers said last month that a durum-wheat squeeze will increase domestic pasta prices by 20% this fall. \n\n  While food-price inflation in many major economies has accelerated, the impact in the 13 countries that share the euro currency has been muted so far. Annual euro-zone food-price inflation was 2.1% in June, compared with 4.8% in the United Kingdom and 4.1% in the U.S. In Japan, where other prices keep falling, the annual inflation rate for food excluding perishables was 0.3% in June. Japan's Q.P. Corp., for instance, lifted mayonnaise prices for businesses and consumers by about 10% in June. \n\n  Some economists say the strong euro has shielded the euro zone from some price increases. Most food commodities are priced in dollars, so a stronger euro makes those products cheaper for European buyers. The euro has risen nearly 4% against the dollar since the start of the year and now hovers near record highs around $1.37. And in contrast to the U.K., where a strong pound also damps commodity-price inflation, euro-zone consumer demand has been relatively weak, deterring producers and supermarkets from raising prices. \n\n  That is changing. \"Euro-zone growth has picked up and is therefore increasing the pricing power of retailers,\" says Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. Mr. Nielsen notes that falling unemployment could boost domestic consumption across the bloc. Rising food prices could be particularly relevant for the European Central Bank and borrowers across the continent. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, the ECB, which sets euro-zone monetary policy, focuses on \"headline\" inflation -- that is, inflation with volatile food and energy costs included. That has some fretting that the bloc's inflation rate will rise further than expected. \n\n  \"We're concerned,\" says Nick Matthews, economist with Barclays Capital in London. Mr. Matthews expects inflation to hit 2.4% later this year, above the ECB's 2% ceiling, and says higher food prices could bump the rate up further. \n\n  Before last week's global credit crunch, which prompted the ECB to pump 213.6 billion euros into euro-zone money markets, most economists expected the bank to raise interest rates to 4.25% in September from 4%, as inflation pressures, including rising energy costs and robust economic growth, mount. \n\n  But if market turbulence continues and the ECB keeps injecting money into the system, a September rate increase is less likely. \n\n  While food prices are rising across the bloc, Germans may feel a particular pinch. German dairy farmers have paid heavy fines -- 134 million euros in 2005 -- for ignoring EU milk-production quotas but now largely produce within legal limits, a change that is squeezing supply. \n\n  Particularly slack domestic demand has also kept retail prices low. Last year, German prices for milk, cheese and eggs were just 87% of the EU average. \"Germany, in particular, has room to catch up,\" says Barclays's Mr. Matthews. But rising prices there \"reflect supply pressures across the board,\" he says. \n\n  Overall, the factors pushing up euro-zone food prices mirror the dynamics at work globally. The push to use some crops to produce biofuels is one culprit; changing weather patterns are another. Australia's continuing drought means farmers there can't fulfill as many orders. European farmers are stepping in, particularly to meet milk-product demand. \n\n  Fast growth and changing palates in developing countries are also to blame. Germany is by far the EU's largest dairy producer, and its milk-product exports -- from whey powder to soft cheese -- to Eastern Europe, developing Asia and oil-producing countries has skyrocketed. The value of German milk and cream exports to Hungary rose to 29 million euros last year from 1.6 million euros in 2002; the value of whey-powder exports to China over the same period jumped to 5.5 million euros from 247,000 euros. \n\n  Economists expect global demand to keep climbing, as developing-market consumers continue shifting their eating habits from basics like bread to fare such as cheese and meat. Until those countries develop the capacity to meet their own demand, economists say prices will continue to rise. \n\n  The food-price jump has already prompted the EU to cut some subsidies. For years, high labor and production costs have kept European dairy prices above those in the rest of the world. \n\n  In response, the EU used to offer dairy farmers refunds to make up the difference on products they exported at lower prices. In 2004, those refunds totaled 1.5 billion euros. With global prices rising, the EU started phasing out the program last year. \n\n  For Europe, economists say, it is the dawn of a new era. \"Suddenly, there's a factor that was never visible in the domestic market,\" says Stefan Tangermann, director for food, agriculture and fisheries at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \"That is: What do the Chinese eat?\" \n\n  ---

1.5% In Survey -2-\n\n \n\n  Products and services with the highest price variations last month included alcoholic drinks and tobacco with a 4.5% increase, food and non-alcoholic beverages up 2.3%, and restaurant and hotel services with a 1.3% rise. Meanwhile, communications services saw prices fall 0.3%, in part due to the state's decision to cut prices for phone service after nationalizing the country's largest telecom company, CA Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela. \n\n  Venezuela's central bank pointed out that the CPI's climb was fueled by higher prices for goods with no price controls, which surged 1.8% last month. Products subject to price regulation, on the other hand, inched up 0.2%. \n\n  President Hugo Chavez has vowed to deliver a 12% inflation rate at year-end, a goal economists argue is wishful thinking, especially since inflationary pressures build up as the year draws to a close. Economists expect the CPI rise to end closer to 17%, the same as last year. \n\n  Chavez has imposed price controls on a series of goods, his main tool to keep prices in check. Lately he has also offered subsidies to those producers who keep prices unchanged even in the face of rising costs. He has also threatened businesses with expropriation if they violate price controls. \n\n  In one of his latest moves, Chavez cut the value added tax twice this year to 9% from 11%, in hopes of slowing price markups in the oil-rich economy. Indeed, the latest cut became effective in July and the CPI rise posted as a result was 0.5%. \n\n  His administration lately prohibited schools from raising their tuition fees but many of them are negotiating with parents hoping to find alternatives to alleviate costs. \n\n  A robust black market dollar, however, has become a stone in Chavez's shoe. The price for the greenback in the parallel market now stands at 4,900 bolivars per dollar, more than twice the official rate of VEB2,150. Venezuelans turn to the black market to obtain more dollars than the government makes available as part of a capital controls policy created in 2003 to curtail capital flight. High dollar prices have become a factor pushing up inflation in this import-dependent nation. \n\n \n\n  -By Raul Gallegos; Dow Jones Newswires; +58-212-564-1339; raul.gallegos@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 01, 2007 08:23 ET (12:23 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.852517Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-01T15:53:06.374524Z", "inner_id": 42, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7675, "annotations": [{"id": 6772, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 142, "end": 183, "text": "trade-weighted basket of other currencies", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "389921", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 447, "end": 467, "text": "key refinancing rate", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "359212", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 766, "end": 776, "text": "oil prices", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "630400", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 945, "end": 954, "text": "exporters", "labels": ["Trade Balance"]}, "id": "573661", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1400, "end": 1435, "text": "trade-weighted basket of currencies", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "859594", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1723, "end": 1738, "text": "current account", "labels": ["Trade Balance"]}, "id": "251245", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1792, "end": 1799, "text": "exports", "labels": ["Trade Balance"]}, "id": "553374", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1998, "end": 2012, "text": "credit markets", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "641101", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2038, "end": 2053, "text": "domestic demand", "labels": ["Demand (residual)"]}, "id": "451897", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2930, "end": 2940, "text": "oil prices", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "747841", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3045, "end": 3062, "text": "unemployment rate", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "257189", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 723, "end": 745, "text": "inflationary pressures", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "1a_1cDK-jm", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"start": 2890, "end": 2912, "text": "inflationary pressures", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "MVMaXu8sUx", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "630400", "to_id": "1a_1cDK-jm", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}, {"from_id": "747841", "to_id": "MVMaXu8sUx", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-24T09:36:57.249311Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T09:36:57.249348Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-24T09:35:35.191551Z", "lead_time": 127.973, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 14, "unique_id": "a7d6e1dd-bd20-4522-a5fd-ec4a15fa0403", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7675, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2102, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2102], "data": {"inner_id": 292, "text": "IMF Deppler: Euro Level Not A &quot;Big Problem&quot; For Econ Growth\n\n \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--The euro hasn't appreciated sharply against a trade-weighted basket of other currencies, and at current levels isn't a major drag on economic growth, the head of the International Monetary Fund's European department said Monday. \n\n  And in a report on the outlook for European economies, the IMF said the European Central bank's decision to leave its key refinancing rate on hold since the onset of the turmoil in global credit markets was \"appropriate.\" \n\n  However, the IMF added that should credit markets return to normal soon, the ECB and other European central banks may need to raise their key interest rates to counter inflationary pressures arising from higher oil prices. \n\n  Although the euro lost ground against the dollar Monday, it has gained over 10% against the greenback over the last 12 months. \n\n  That has led to complaints from exporters about their loss of competitiveness on international markets, and renewed warnings from euro-zone policymakers of the dangers of high levels of volatility in foreign exchange markets. \n\n  Finance ministers from the euro zone will discuss the currency's strength against the dollar and the Chinese yuan when they meet later Monday in Brussels. \n\n  But, speaking at a press conference, the director of the IMF's European department said against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, the euro has appreciated much less sharply. \n\n  \"In our view, the value of the euro - taken on an effective basis - remains in a range where the economy is continuing to function well,\" Michael Deppler said. \"We don't see a big problem.\" \n\n  The IMF official noted that the euro zone's current account is expected to be \"roughly balanced\" in 2008, while \"exports are doing well.\" \n\n  In its first report on the economy of Europe as a whole, the IMF said it expects growth to slow only \"moderately\" next year. In contrast to the U.S., it expects developments in credit markets to have little effect on domestic demand, which it predicts will continue to expand at around 2.5%. \n\n  \"The exposure of households in the U.S. is significantly greater than it is in Europe,\" Deppler said. \n\n  The IMF official said with a small number of exceptions - the U.K., Spain and Ireland - housing markets in Europe are \"fairly balanced.\" He added that there is no evidence of an equivalent to problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. \n\n  \"There are no correspondingly severe problems with lending to Europeans that we can detect,\" Deppler said. \n\n  The IMF said key interest rates have \"been appropriately kept on hold\" by the ECB and other European central banks while there are risks to growth from the turmoil in credit markets. But, it added that \"a further tightening may be required\" if those risks don't materialize.\" \n\n  In particular, Deppler cited the inflationary pressures caused by rising oil prices in the context of economic growth that the IMF expects won't be much below potential at a time when the unemployment rate in many countries is low by recent historic standards. \n\n  The IMF said the response of central banks to the turmoil in credit markets \"has been broadly effective so far.\" \n\n  \"Central banks will have to continue to stand ready to provide liquidity to deal with systemic risks,\" the Fund said. \n\n \n\n  -By Paul Hannon, Dow Jones Newswires, +44 20 7842 9491, paul.hannon@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  November 12, 2007 08:00 ET (13:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {},

{"inner_id": 294, "text": "FATHOM FINANCIAL: $100 Oil Is Here, So Now What?\n\n \n\n  By Danny Gabay \n\n  Of Fathom Financial Consulting \n\n  LONDON (Dow Jones)--A couple of years ago, a brief discussion paper by Goldman Sachs analysts mentioned the prospect of crude oil reaching $100 per barrel. \n\n  At the time the price of a barrel of crude oil was just over $70. Although the media picked up on the story few investors took it too seriously. \n\n  Most agreed that should such an event transpire, then a global recession would be a foregone conclusion, which would bring the price of oil right back down. \n\n  Well, here we nearly are. This week the price of a barrel of crude oil reached $98. \n\n  So, is it time to panic? \n\n  The message from three of the world's biggest central banks this week was no, or at least not yet. \n\n  The Bank of England left rates on hold at 5.75%, and made no comment. We will get an insight into how the Old Lady sees the world when we see her quarterly inflation report. \n\n  The European Central Bank also left rates on hold, albeit at the much lower level of 4%. \n\n  In the press conference that followed the decision, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet sounded more concerned about upside inflation risks than he did about downside growth risks, though he did note the \"brutal\" rise of the euro. That looks like ECB code for \"it's gone too far.\" \n\n  And finally, in his testimony to Congress, the Federal Reserve Board chairman warned about slowing growth but seemed to spend more time warning about the dangers of higher inflation. \n\n  The overall message to the markets was this: \"You're on your own, at least for now.\" \n\n  This came as a disappointment to the markets, already reeling from the credit squeeze and now looking at the highest real oil price on record. \n\n  Adjusted using the U.S. gross domestic product deflator, the oil price has now passed its 1980 peak. \n\n  But the global economy continues to power ahead - even the supposedly ailing U.S. managed close to 4% growth in the three months to September. \n\n  So, has oil lost its power to shock? \n\n  A number of optimists say yes. \n\n  We were worried at $50 per barrel and nothing happened; and we worried when it hit $80 per barrel and the global economy continued to grow rapidly. So, why should we worry about $100 per barrel? \n\n  The most popular explanation for the belief that oil has lost its power to stop the global economy in its tracks revolves around the fact that we have become far more efficient users of oil. \n\n  The question of why the economy may be less vulnerable to oil price shocks today has been examined by a number of recent academic studies. \n\n  James Hamilton, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, provides the following summary on his blog. \n\n  Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gali have identified four factors as all making a contribution: (a) good luck (i.e., lack of concurrent adverse shocks), (b) smaller share of oil in production, (c) more flexible labor markets and (d) improvements in monetary policy. \n\n  A study last year from the Congressional Budget Office emphasized a similar list of favorable developments. \n\n  Jerry Taylor and Peter VanDoren review some of the other evidence, and conclude: \"All the new analyses agree that the more flexible economy that we have now, allows us to cope more easily with oil price shocks.... It is time for America to get over its inordinate fear of oil shocks. Soaring prices aren't pretty, but they are scarcely the existential threat to our economy posited by many.\" \n\n  As a share of GDP, oil consumption has certainly fallen across the developed world. That means, according to some estimates, that crude oil will need to reach $150 per barrel before it has the same potential to hurt as $90 (in today's money) did back in 1980. \n\n  There is a good deal of logic to this argument. Better oil efficiency must make a difference. \n\n  But even so, we hardly want to wait around to find out how painful $140 per barrel might be. \n\n  One of the key reasons that the oil shocks of the 1970s had such a devastating effect on global growth was that they were both, in the economics jargon, supply shocks. \n\n  When any price rises unexpectedly it can be seen as either a demand shock - excess demand pushing up prices - or as a supply shock - insufficient supply, which also pushes up prices. \n\n  The trick of course is to work out which it is. Demand shocks are relatively easy for central banks to deal with; they can simply raise interest rates to curb demand. \n\n  But supply shocks are a completely different matter. In the face of an adverse supply shock a central bank will be torn between the negative impact on demand and the positive impact on inflation. \n\n  Indeed, that largely sums up the message from the Fed and the ECB this week. They each recognized both sides of the dilemma. And the problem is if they go for the wrong lever or even simply too early, it could all get very unpleasant. \n\n  The U.K. authorities probably got the first oil shock in 1974 about as wrong as it was possible to. They managed to preside over near 30% inflation and mass unemployment. \n\n  Lessons have obviously been learned. \n\n  But it doesn't help when the data we are all relying on change the underlying picture. \n\n  We use the data from the International Energy Agency, a branch of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to analyze the underlying causes of any change in the price of oil. \n\n  Until recently we had concluded that an increase in demand, largely from China and India, was the overwhelming force driving up oil prices. \n\n  Negative supply shocks had contributed to the rise, most notably after Hurricane Katrina, but they accounted for less than a fifth of the rise since 2002, by our calculation. \n\n  But then the data on real oil consumption were revised, on the back of U.S. GDP revisions and higher Chinese demand. \n\n  There was also a significant downward revision to oil supply. Rather than being a positive force as the IEA had originally expected it to be, oil production slowed during 2007. \n\n  OPEC quotas played a role, but the bigger miscalculation was the failure to materialize of an expected surge in sub-Saharan African supply. \n\n  There were also revisions to the previous year's data, leaving the overall picture significantly changed. \n\n  Adverse supply shocks appear to now account for around half of the rise in crude oil prices since 2005. \n\n  If true, that will only complicate the issue for central banks around the world. \n\n  The danger is that the rise in real prices might combine with the ongoing credit squeeze to produce a toxic cocktail. \n\n  The hope is that central banks have learned the lessons of the 1970s. \n\n  As long as inflation expectations stay well anchored, there is a very good chance that this time will be different. \n\n \n\n  -By Danny Gabay, 44-207-796-9561; danny.gabay@fathom-consulting.com \n\n  (Danny Gabay is a director of Fathom Financial Consulting Ltd. and a member of London Diversified Fund Management LLP.) \n\n  Opinions expressed are those of the author, and not of Dow Jones Newswires. \n\n  This column is published for information only, and it neither constitutes, nor is to be construed as, an offer to buy or sell investments.

than expected budget surplus in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, buoyed by demand for the country's natural resources, particularly from China, independent forecaster Access Economics predicted Monday. \n\n  But the newly elected Labor government will need to cut public spending to take the pressure off domestic inflation and prevent the surplus from dropping below 1% of gross domestic product as commodity prices recede, it said. \n\n  In a budget monitor report, Access said it expected the government to deliver an underlying budget surplus in 2007-08 of A$15.5 billion, A$1.1 billion higher than a Treasury estimate issued ahead of the Nov. 24 federal election. \n\n  The usually conservative Treasury department, in a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook in October, forecast a 2007-08 budget surplus of A$14.4 billion, down from A$17.2 billion in 2006-07. \n\n  Access Economics' forecast is A$700,000 above a forecast surplus of A$14.8 billion made in a midyear economic and fiscal outlook released by Treasury officials at the start of the six-week election campaign. \n\n  Booming commodity prices have boosted tax revenues for the past five and a half years, allowing the government to deliver surpluses that beat Treasury forecasts. \n\n  But Access Economics warned that center-left Labor - which won the election in a landslide victory over the 11-year-old Liberal-National coalition government - needs to cut back on spending to avoid creating further inflationary headaches for the country's central bank. \n\n  Access Economics director Chris Richardson said that the previous administration, by redistributing larger-than-expected surpluses through tax cuts, turned off the \"automatic stabilizers\" that traditionally saw the budget improve in an economic upswing and worsen in a downswing. \n\n  \"That meant the burden of macro management fell solely to the Reserve Bank of Australia,\" Richardson said. \"The end result of that process means, under current circumstances, a simple equation applies: tax cuts equal interest rate rises.\" \n\n  Labor is promising income tax cuts that will cost A$31 billion over the next three years. But it also plans to take a \"razor gang\" approach to public spending, cutting back on some programs introduced by the previous government. \n\n  \"If it succeeds in trimming waste and improves value in doing so, that will come with the considerable additional benefit of taking pressure off interest rates,\" Richardson said. \n\n  Access Economics also cautioned that with growth in both demand and profits tipped to slow, the government will need to cut back on spending in coming years to make sure it meets its target of keeping the budget in surplus on average over the economic cycle. \n\n  \"Unless policies change, the surplus will drop back to 0.6% of gross domestic product by 2010-11, and it is seen heading further south thereafter,\" Richardson said. \n\n  Access Economics is forecasting a surplus of A$15 billion in 2008-09, A$13.6 billion in 2009-10, and A$8.2 billion in 2010-11. \n\n  That compares with Treasury's midyear forecast for budget surpluses of A$14.4 billion in 2008-09, A$17.7 billion in 2009-10, and A$15.1 billion in 2010-11. \n\n \n\n  -By Rachel Pannett, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-6208-0901; rachel.pannett@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones

Deposit Requirement - Sources\n\n \n   (Adds analysts' comments, background on special deposits) \n \n\n  SHANGHAI (Dow Jones)--China's central bank has told  selected city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives they must place special deposits with it on Dec. 27, the second time this year it has adopted this unconventional approach to drain liquidity, two people familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday. \n\n  The decision indicates Beijing's mounting concerns over the excess liquidity in its financial system caused by a ballooning trade surplus. It also came after the remarks by People's Bank of China Vice Gov. Wu Xiaoling over the weekend that China needs to further curb money-supply and credit growth because \"monetary factors\" do add to inflation pressures. \n\n  Despite the PBOC's instruction, the banks and cooperatives participating in the program can decide how much they are each willing to place as special deposits, said the two people, who declined to be named. \n\n  The central bank will offer an interest rate of 3.37% on three-month deposits and 3.99% on one-year deposits, they added. The two rates are the same as the yields on the three-month and one-year bills the PBOC sold in its regular open market operation last week. \n\n  An official at the PBOC's news department declined to comment. \n\n  The PBOC last told an unspecified group of city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives to submit special deposits Oct. 17, the first time since 2000 it used this method to withdraw liquidity. \n\n  \"The special deposit has gradually become a routine tightening tool by the central bank to strengthen its credit control in smaller financial institutions. It also reflects the pressure the central bank's facing to curb rising inflation,\" said Shanghai Securities analyst Wang Yingfeng. \n\n  Despite the central bank's five interest rate hikes and nine reserve requirement ratio increases in the first 11 months of this year, China's consumer price index accelerated to an 11-year high of 6.9% in November. The PBOC said Dec. 8 it will increase banks' reserve requirement ratio for the 10th time this year by 100 basis points, twice as much as previous increases this year. \n\n  Compared with the upcoming 100 basis-point ratio hike, which is expected to take about CNY350 billion out of circulation, the total amount drained by the special deposits is unlikely to be huge, given the small asset base of city commercial banks and credit cooperatives, analysts said. \n\n  A Shanghai-based fund manager said he expects the special deposits to lock up around CNY10 billion in funds. \n\n  \"But if the PBOC fails to slow down the growth in money supply and inflation in the coming months, it could order the smaller lenders to deposit more funds next time,\" said the fund manager, who declined to be named.

accelerated in December, exceeding analyst expectations, as food and energy prices remained at an elevated level, the Central Statistics Office, or KSH said Tuesday. \n\n  Headline consumer prices rose 0.4% on the month and were up 7.4% from a year earlier in December, rising considerably faster than the median forecast of 15 analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires, who had predicted a rise of 7.2%. Forecasts had come in a relatively narrow range of 7.2% and 7.5%. \n\n  \"I can't say new things - it's evidently food and energy prices again, cooking oil, milk, dairy products and eggs...the rise in the other categories was negligible,\" a KSH statistician told Dow Jones Newswires at the time of the release. \n\n  Food prices rose 0.8% and car fuel prices increased 2.0% on the month, slowing somewhat from monthly rises of 1.4% and 3.3% respectively in November. The slower increase was expected by analysts. The price of cooking oil jumped 9.2% on the month while cheese rose 2.8% and eggs rose 1.7% in the same period. \n\n  Although food and energy prices boosted headline inflation, services prices, which are also closely watched by analysts, rose only 0.1%. Consumer durables prices fell 0.1% and clothing prices were unchanged on the month in December. \n\n  Core inflation, excluding volatile energy and food prices, also picked up in December. \n\n  \"Unprocessed food prices such as (the price of) eggs are excluded from the core reading but processed food prices are not,\" Minary added. She cited milk as a booster for core prices as well as for the headline reading, as milk prices rose 2.4% on the month. \n\n  Minary declined to be specific on the outlook for inflation. She noted, however, that price hikes reported in the local press by local governments of certain services prices such as public transport, utilities, and other centrally mandated price rises as postal services will boost January inflation, as most probably will a full liberalization of the power market. \n\n  Inflation was 8.0% on average in 2007, up sharply from 3.9% in 2006, but in line with analysts' forecasts in a poll carried out by Dow Jones Newswires. \n\n \n   Statistics office Web site: www.ksh.hu \n \n\n  -By Margit Feher, Dow Jones Newswires; +36-20-925-2364; margit.feher@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 15, 2008 04:17 ET (09:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.853011Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-01T15:36:26.916962Z", "inner_id": 48, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7681, "annotations": [{"id": 6778, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 53, "end": 56, "text": "CPI", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "793629", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 862, "end": 879, "text": "baseline scenario", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "510641", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1195, "end": 1199, "text": "euro", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "495288", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1322, "end": 1325, "text": "oil", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "699065", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1330, "end": 1350, "text": "raw materials prices", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "155651", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1540, "end": 1559, "text": "raw material prices", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "303481", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1564, "end": 1569, "text": "wages", "labels": ["Wages"]}, "id": "594095", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1593, "end": 1607, "text": "interest rates", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "792092", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1696, "end": 1716, "text": "liquidity injections", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "956354", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1477, "end": 1496, "text": "inflationary forces", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "48efyrxD1n", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "699065", "to_id": "48efyrxD1n", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}, {"from_id": "155651", "to_id": "48efyrxD1n", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-24T09:49:16.102538Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-24T09:49:16.102563Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-24T09:48:54.160080Z", "lead_time": 69.72, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 11, "unique_id": "0bc6eddc-87da-429c-9e47-41889f8783ac", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7681, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2108, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2108], "data": {"inner_id": 309, "text": "3rd UPDATE: ECB Bini Smaghi:Downside GDP Risk,Upside CPI Risk\n\n \n\n  (Adds further quote on market turmoil.) \n\n \n\n  FLORENCE, Italy (Dow Jones)--Downside risks to growth and upside risks to the inflation rate prevail in the euro zone, senior European Central Bank official Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said Wednesday. \n\n  The next ECB staff projections, due to be released March 6, will contain \"novelties,\" Bini Smaghi said on the sidelines of a conference. The new projections will reflect greater possibilities that growth will slow more than expected, while price trends move higher than anticipated, he said. \n\n  \"Some news is positive, some news is negative,\" he said about recent economic data from the euro zone. Germany's Ifo business sentiment index unexpectedly rose in February, while other indicators have been weakening. \n\n  Bini Smaghi also said the ECB's \"baseline scenario\" is that the U.S. economy won't enter a recession. \"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound,\" he said. \n\n  \"The American economy is being influenced by the financial market turmoil, which in Europe seems to be more limited,\" he added. \n\n  However, a slower U.S. economy will inevitably have an impact on the euro zone, he said. The two large economies may be somewhat diverging, but they are in the same cycle, he said. \n\n  The rising oil and raw materials prices are a \"big worry, because they reflect the scarcity of resources,\" he said. \n\n  \"We have to avoid letting these hikes trigger inflationary forces,\" he added. \"We must limit the effects of (raw material prices) on wages.\" \n\n  The ECB has left interest rates unchanged since credit markets ground to a halt last summer, while offering large-scale liquidity injections into the banking system. \n\n  The market turmoil \"will take some time to be digested,\" Bini Smaghi said. \n\n  The main problem, he added, is that \"banks don't trust each other.\" \n\n  \"Confidence in the financial system's ability to assess some financial instruments has crumbled,\" the central banker said. \n\n  That has stymied the interbank lending market, which in turn has pushed up short-term money market rates. Banks are concerned that counterparty collateral may be exposed to U.S. subprime mortgages and other weakening credits. \n\n  \"It's probably a more complex process than in the past,\" Bini Smaghi said, referring to the current credit market turmoil compared with the Asian crisis of the late 1990s or the crash in technology stocks that began in 2000. \n\n \n\n  -By Luca Di Leo, Dow Jones

\n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n  SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australian wages growth remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2007, in line with expectations, likely adding to the Reserve Bank of Australia's concerns that cost pressures from the tight labor market are now feeding into the broader inflationary landscape. \n\n  The figures have added to the already strong case for a quarter of a percentage point interest rate hike in March and build on arguments for a followup move in May. \n\n  It also shows that inflationary pressures in Australia, driven by strong domestic demand, high commodities prices and capacity constraints, are broadening as the RBA has recently warned. \n\n  Australian wages excluding bonuses rose 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007 from the third quarter and rose 4.2% from a year earlier, Australian Bureau of Statistics labor price data issued Wednesday show. \n\n  In the private sector, wages excluding bonuses rose 1.1% in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and rose 4.3% from a year earlier. Public-sector wages rose 1.0% in the quarter and increased 4.1% from a year earlier. \n\n  Wages including bonuses rose 1.1% in the quarter and rose 4.5% on the year. \n\n  ICAP chief economist Matthew Johnson says while the figures were as-expected, it still pointed to the RBA remained poised for a round of near-term tightening. \n\n  \"That trend in the private sector data is a little bit worrying and that would reflect what the RBA is saying about these sorts of wage pressures out there,\" Johnson said. \n\n  \"There is nothing in this data to suggest that the RBA was wrong to be worried about wages...however, there is nothing in the data that really sounds the alarm bells.\" \n\n  In the last week-and-a-half, the central bank has delivered several warnings the wage increases were beginning to spill over into price chains. \n\n  On Tuesday, RBA assistant governor Malcolm Edey said there had been some very recent evidence of higher wages growth. \n\n  This adds to what the RBA said in its very hawkish quarterly statement on monetary policy released last week, which all but confirmed a March rate hike. \n\n  The minutes from the RBA's Feb. 5 meeting, when it voted to lift rates a quarter of a percentage point to 7.0%, revealed Tuesday the central bank had even considered a 50 basis point increase this month. \n\n  TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said   wages growth remained uncomfortably high for the RBA at current levels. \n\n  \"The RBA still has an inflation headache to deal with,\" he said. \n\n  \"Broadly speaking, wages appear to be edging higher and for the RBA to soften its hawkish policy stance, the data needed to have a downward surprise. \n\n  \"On an annualized basis, wages look to be heading from 4.0% to more than 4.5% year-on-year, and the RBA will view that as a threat to inflation.\" \n\n  ANZ senior economist Tony Pearson said the annual rate of growth in private sector wages was the highest reading since the series started in 1998. \n\n  \"There's still evidence of a gradual swelling of wage pressures,\" he said. \n\n  \"There hasn't been a wage breakout in the sense of a sharp uptick, but it does indicate a gradual acceleration of private sector wages. \n\n  \"That's the series we've been focused on from a policy perspective.\" \n\n  However, other data released Wednesday pointed to a moderation in the economy. \n\n  The Westpac-Melbourne Institute economic leading indicator grew at an annualized rate of 4.7% in December, down from 6.1% in November, suggesting a moderation in the likely pace of economic growth toward long-term trend levels in the next three to nine months. \n\n  And an index of job vacancies for skilled workers in Australia fell by 2.2% in February from January, and was 6.4% lower from a year ago, the Department of Employment said. \n\n  The index currently stands at 97.7. \n\n  Despite the on-consensus wages date, the Australian dollar sold off as traders took back short positions on news the data weren't higher than expected. \n\n  The Australian dollar fell to US$0.9174 when the figures were published at 0030 GMT, from US$0.9194 earlier. At 0101 GMT, the Australian dollar was US$0.9191. Australian bonds were marginally stronger also on relief buying with both 3-year futures and 10-year futures up half a basis point each at 93.035 and 93.48, respectively. \n\n  -By Sam Holmes, Dow

\n\n  Marches, Others \n\n  May Follow \n\n \n\n  Among the world's major central banks, the Federal Reserve looks as out-of-place as a person showing up to a black-tie affair in a Halloween costume. \n\n  Since September, the Fed has slashed its federal-funds-rate target by 2 1/2 percentage points to 3%, as aggressive as its cuts going into the 2001 recession. \n\n  Other central bankers have been loath to follow the Fed's lead. The Bank of England has cut its target rate just twice since December, by just a half percentage point in total. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan haven't touched rates since credit problems emerged last year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has been raising rates, with the most recent increase coming yesterday. \n\n  ECB and Bank of England policy makers meet this week and are expected to keep rates unchanged. Despite signs of economic weakness, inflation in Europe and the United Kingdom has been high, making them reluctant to pursue stimulative rate cuts. \n\n  Why the disconnect? The Fed might be on the wrong course. Many complain its easy-money policy is fueling global commodity inflation, making it harder for other central banks to do their jobs. \n\n  Another possibility is that other nations are insulated from America's woes and are correctly staying out of the U.S. mess. If the global economy was really slowing, this argument goes, commodity prices would be falling, not soaring. \n\n  A third possibility, and probably the most likely, is that the rest of the world will eventually have to catch up to the Fed. The Australian central bank, even as it raised interest rates, noted tighter credit conditions and softer business and consumer sentiment in commodity-rich Australia and warned that \"global growth will be below trend in 2008.\" Canada's central bank has also gotten into the rate-cutting act, saying the U.S. slump would have \"significant spillover effects on the global economy.\" \n\n  Central bank easing policies will eventually converge, says Lena Komileva, Group-of-Seven economist at Tullett Prebon. The slow response of others means their economies might keep slowing even after a U.S. recovery sets in. \n\n \n\n  Corporate Insiders Decide \n\n  It's Time to Buy Shares \n\n \n\n  Here's a silver lining in the market. Corporate executives are gobbling up their own companies' shares. \n\n  Insider buying in February was 26% higher than the average for the month over the past six years, while selling was about half the average, Thomson Financial says. Nearly half of the buying came from large-cap companies, including hard-hit financial and technology companies. \n\n  Some investors watch how executives treat their own companies' shares; they might buy when seeing opportunities other investors don't. \n\n  \"I like to see that management thinks their company is at a price that represents some value,\" says Robert Pavlik, chief investment officer at Oaktree Asset Management. \n\n  The catch is that insiders aren't always the smartest money or the best signal about a stock. Sometimes executives don't know what's about to hit them, or they're buying or selling for reasons that don't mesh with the rest of the market. Despite a number of MBIA insider buys in late 2007, for example, the shares are down more than 30% this year. \n\n  -- Scott Patterson \n\n  --- \n\n  Email mark.gongloff@wsj.com or

analyst comment) \n\n  DUBAI (Zawya Dow Jones)--MAF Hypermarkets signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Economy Thursday to maintain the 2007 prices of 52 basic food commodities in all Carrefour stores in the Persian Gulf state. \n\n  The MoU is in line with \"continuous efforts by the   Ministry to stabilize prices, reduce inflation levels, maintain market balance and protect the consumer,\" said Mohammed Al Shihhi, undersecretary at the Ministry of Economy. \n\n  The government aims to reduce inflation in the U.A.E. from 10.9% to 5% this year through a series of economic measures, but not through dropping its peg to the weak dollar which economists say accounts for up to 40% of total inflation in the country. \n\n  Food items that will have prices capped include rice, eggs, milk, meat, bread, tea, water, sugar, salt, vegetable oil and beans among others. \n\n  The initiative, which applies to all buyers regardless of whether they are U.A.E. nationals or expatriates, will be effective from Sunday till December 2008, said Henri Changeux, Senior Vice President of Carrefour. \n\n  Up to 70% of the items on the list are Carrefour's most popular brands and Carrefour will not be raising prices of other goods to make up for the expected loss in revenues, Changeux said, adding the initiative was part of its \"social responsibility\". \n\n  \"We support this initiative, our job is to fulfill the needs of the customer at the best price,\" Changeux told reporters at a press conference in Dubai. \n\n  Last week Lulu Hypermarket Group signed a similar MoU to cap prices of 32 goods. Its Chairman Yousif Ali said in a statement: \"The Group responded quickly to the MoE's initiative based on its conviction about the importance of such programs to eliminate any negative practices that threaten free competition in the UAE.\" \n\n  Ali went on to say the UAE's private sector should \"not focus solely on profits\" and pointed out \"the danger of inflation for both the society and the economy\". \n\n  BACKDOOR DEAL \n\n  But analysts said both profit-making businesses were unlikely to have agreed to such an initiative without an agreement with the government to make up for losses to be incurred. \n\n  \"There must have been some sort of backdoor deal because there are definitely losses and someone needs to shoulder these losses,\" said Eckart Woertz, chief economist at Gulf Research Center. \n\n  He added the government was likely reimbursing them in some way such as lowering rents or electricity rates. \n\n  Both Lulu and Carrefour were unavailable for comment on potential losses to revenues when contacted by Zawya Dow Jones. \n\n  In March the Union Cooperative Society in Dubai agreed to fix prices on 16 basic goods at 2007 levels. \n\n  MAF hypermarkets operate Carrefour stores through a joint venture. \n\n  -By Tahani Karrar, Dow Jones Newswires; +9714 364 4965; tahani.karrar@dowjones.com \n\n  Copyright (c) 2008 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \n\n \n\n

EFFORT to curb inflation, India's government has suspended futures trade in four commodities, and many economists expect further restrictions in this nascent market. \n\n  Inflation at the wholesale level has been hovering above 7% on an annual basis, well above the government's comfort zone. The government sees futures markets as contributors to India's staggering rise in food prices and banned futures trading in rice and wheat last year. Last week, it banned futures trading in soy oil, chick peas, potatoes and rubber for at least four months. \n\n  But critics said the ban will exacerbate rather than relieve inflation by shutting down valuable market-pricing mechanisms and encouraging traders to move to the country's untaxed and unregulated black market of so-called dabba traders. \n\n  The new suspensions came as a surprise after a government-appointed committee reported last month that it couldn't find any conclusive evidence that futures trading drove up prices. It declined to recommend a trading suspension. But with national elections coming within a year, the ruling coalition, which is led by the Congress Party, faces protests and dissent from left-wing partners, who have been clamoring for action to bring down the price of food staples. \n\n  Even some in the government have doubts that the suspension will have an effect on prices. \"We were opposed to the suspensions,\" said B.C. Khatua, chairman of the Forwards Markets Commission, which supervises the country's futures exchanges. \"But in a democracy, you have to compromise.\" \n\n  India's futures markets include only a small proportion of the participants in the agricultural sector. The average daily volume traded on the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange, the main market for agricultural futures, is $600 million. India's overall agricultural output was $129 billion in 2006, the latest data available. The small size of the market means that, at best, it has little effect on food prices and, at worst, it can be easily manipulated by relatively small sums of money, traders and analysts said. \n\n  One major concern is that banning futures trading takes away early warnings about price jumps. Farmers, who could look to futures prices as a gauge of the market, now have little alternative but to sell at the spot-market price. \n\n  Futures trading represents \"the canary in the coal mine,\" said Ajay Shah, senior fellow at the government-funded National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. \"It's not right to blame futures trading as the cause of price rises.\" \n\n  The government has made the case that global factors and speculation are pushing up food prices as much as supply-and-demand issues. \"Worse than a price rise is the sentiment of a price rise; worse than inflation is the fear of inflation,\" Kamal Nath, minister of Commerce and Industry, said in a recent interview. \"People tend to stock up and create artificial demand.\" \n\n  Many traders and analysts said that if inflation doesn't dissipate, a wider ban on agricultural-futures trading is likely. The government said it has no such plans now. \n\n  Already, the suspensions on futures trading may be pushing more people to dabba traders. These illegal brokers take prices from official exchanges and let individuals \"buy\" commodities. However, unlike in the official markets, no actual deliverable product is involved in the transaction, and buyers are just betting on changes in prices. Such traders -- dabba means \"box\" in Hindi -- aren't taxed or regulated, leaving participants with little security if a broker turns hostile. \"Because the Indian commodities-futures market is not allowed to operate, people feel aggrieved and go into this type of trading to keep their risk management maintained,\" said Mr. Khatua, of the Forwards Markets Commission. \n\n  Even as India clamps down on futures trading at home, it quietly has been placing its own orders on wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade, two people familiar with the situation said. Over the past year, the government slowly has built up a stack of options to buy 100 million tons of wheat in case of domestic shortages -- a stance some saw as hypocritical, considering the government's stance on futures trading in India. Government officials couldn't be reached to comment over the weekend. \n\n  --- \n\n  Joanna Slater in New York contributed to this article. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  May 11, 2008

Draghi remarks, background) \n\n \n\n  ROME (Dow Jones)--European Central Bank board member Mario Draghi Saturday said the recent buildup in inflationary pressures following the sharp rise in energy and food prices, coupled with the U.S. economic slowdown, represented the major threats to the world economy. \n\n  He added that it was too early to say whether the financial turbulence - stemming from the U.S. mortgage crisis that began in August 2007- was over. \n\n  \"The principal source of concern remains the continued rise in the price of energy and other raw materials,\" said Draghi, who heads the Bank of Italy and the Financial Stability Forum, a global panel of regulators charged with monitoring the financial market crisis. \n\n  The central banker said the price increase in energy and other commodities were \"having a recessionary impact on the advanced economies and feeding inflation, thus constraining the monetary policy stance.\" \n\n  Record oil prices and the recent surge in food prices are creating major headaches for central bankers around the world, which risk stoking inflation by lowering interest rates to boost economic growth. Moreover, the recent price rises are eroding households' purchasing power, hurting consumer spending and the wider economy. \n\n  The inflation rate in the euro zone hit a 16-year high in May as oil prices surged, reinforcing a growing consensus that the ECB won't cut its key interest rate this year. Consumer prices in the 15 countries that use the euro rose 3.6% from a year earlier in May, keeping the rate above the ECB's target ceiling of just under 2% for the ninth straight month. \n\n  Draghi, who helps set ECB monetary policy in the 15-country euro zone, said the central bank had successfully managed to keep inflation under control, with higher consumer prices not translating into higher wages for now. \n\n  \"The firm anchoring of inflation expectations has allowed the European Central Bank to keep interest rates unchanged for quite some time, thus helping to support the economy,\" Draghi said, adding the ECB remains firmly focused on its medium-term price stability objective. \n\n  His remarks are likely to reinforce expectations that the ECB will continue to keep rates on hold this year. While the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have cut interest rates in recent months to boost economic growth, the ECB has left its main rate unchanged since June 2007 to keep a lid on inflation. \n\n  Turning to the market crisis, Draghi said it was too early to say whether the financial turbulence was over. He said that although tensions in some markets were easing, normal conditions have yet to be restored. \n\n  \"The financial turmoil that swept over the major advanced economies brought to an end a long period of growth, low inflation and plentiful credit. It is too early to say that it has passed,\" Draghi said, adding it was also too soon to assess its full impact on the world economy. \n\n  The central banker said that the financial system that will emerge from the current crisis must have different rules, less debt and more capital. \n\n  As head of the Financial Stability Forum, Draghi last month presented a report to the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations that included a series of recommendations for major financial firms, central banks, regulatory bodies and other groups to improve transparency in the financial system and address lax risk-management practices that contributed to the current market crisis. \n\n \n\n  -By Luca Di Leo, Dow Jones Newswires; +39-06-6782543; luca.dileo@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones

(AP)--Asia's growth is being threatened by spiraling inflation due to higher food and fuel cost, an Asian Development Bank executive warned Sunday, as he called on governments to tighten monetary policies to deal with the scourge. \n\n  The bank is reviewing its growth forecast of 7.6% this year for Asia, excluding Japan, amid concerns inflation will widen income inequality in the region and cause more people to plunge into poverty, said its managing director general Rajat M.Nag. \n\n  Asia's growth last year hit a two-decade high of 8.7%. At the same time, the ADB in April forecast inflation to hit 5.1% this year, the highest in a decade. But this forecast may also go up, Nag told The Associated Press. \n\n  Among the worst hit is Vietnam, where inflation is currently more than 25%. Singapore, Thailand, India, Philippines and Indonesia are looking at inflation rates of between 7.5% and 11%. \n\n  \"The growth story is in danger because there are inflationary dark clouds in the horizon, which we have to recognize as the greatest concern,\" Nag said on the sidelines of a two-day global economic forum here. \n\n  \"We feel that monetary policies have to be tightened so that inflationary expectations are tamed,\" he said. Among the measures he suggested were raising interest rates, increasing banks' reserve requirement and ensuring a flexible exchange rate. Some central banks have already reaised borrowing rates in the past two months. \n\n  Surging food prices, stoked by rising fuel costs that have increased production and transport costs, have triggered protests around the world in recent months. Riots have erupted over food shortages in the Caribbean and Africa and hunger is approaching crisis stage in parts of Asia. \n\n  A number of Asian nations such as India, Malaysia and Indonesia recently cut fuel subsidies amid rising world oil prices, which is expected to further send inflation soaring. \n\n  \"Inflation is the most regressive form of taxation and it hits the poor most. In Asia, roughly about a billion people are vulnerable to the food and fuel price increases,\" he said. \n\n  Nag defended the governments for reducing the unaffordable subsidies. But governments must ensure \"targeted cash support\" for the poor to protect them from the price hikes, he said. \n\n  Asia, which is home to two-thirds of the world's poor, successfully cut its poverty rate to about 19% currently, from 33% in 1990, but this is under threat due to inflation, he said. \n\n  Some 600 million people in the region survive on a dollar a day or less, and about 400 million people who live on just above a dollar, making up the most vulnerable group to the price increases. \n\n  The Manila-based development lending institution last month announced $500 million in emergency aid for poor countries struggling with soaring food prices. It will also double its lending for the agricultural sector in 2009 to $2 billion. \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 15, 2008 00:37 ET (04:37 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

JOURNAL ASIA) \n   By Jackie Range in New Delhi and Elffie Chew in Kuala Lumpur \n\n  Amid record crude-oil prices, India and Malaysia announced increases in fuel prices Wednesday, risking higher inflation rates and a backlash from consumers to relieve mounting pressure from subsidies on national finances. \n\n  The countries are the latest Asian nations to trim subsidies that have long cushioned consumers -- including manufacturers and other businesses -- from rising energy costs. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan have substantially increased state-regulated fuel prices, as well. \n\n  India raised the retail prices of gasoline and diesel by about 10% to trim growing losses at state-run oil marketing companies that sell fuel at subsidized rates. Lifting prices for the second time this year, the government will add three rupees (seven U.S. cents) to the price of a liter of diesel and five rupees to a liter of gasoline, effective Thursday. New Delhi also scrapped a 5% import tax on crude oil and cut the import tax on gasoline and diesel to 2.5% from 7.5%. \n\n  In oil- and gas-producing Malaysia, the government made a much bigger 41% increase in heavily subsidized gasoline prices, and said it would also boost diesel prices and electricity rates. Kuala Lumpur said it plans to start using global market rates for pricing fuel to avert an ever-growing subsidy burden on the country's budget. \n\n  The decisions to pass along higher fuel costs to consumers were taken despite the threat of higher inflation and possible political unrest in both India and Malaysia. \n\n  In India, Asia's second fastest-growing major economy, the fuel price increases could further weaken the ruling Congress Party-led coalition government's prospects in a general election that must be held by May in which it is expected to lose ground. The government is already grappling with the political fallout of higher inflation -- now at its highest level since September 2004. \n\n  In the week ended May 17, India's wholesale price index rose 8.1% from a year earlier. Mumbai-based ratings agency Crisil, predicts the fuel-price increase will push up wholesale price inflation by 0.95 percentage point. But Crisil economist Dharmakirti Joshi doesn't expect the increase to hamper economic growth and is sticking to his forecast that India's gross domestic product will expand 8.1% in the fiscal year ending March 31. \n\n  Still, higher fuel prices and inflation are likely to turn up the pressure on the Congress Party. Rising inflation was cited as a key reason for its recent failure in elections in the southern state of Karnataka, which followed defeats in contests in several other states. \n\n  Communist allies of the Congress Party threatened to block roads and rail traffic beginning Thursday to protest the fuel-price increase. The leftist parties, whose support is necessary for India's coalition government to stay in power, want a review of the price decision. But Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Murli Deora told a briefing Wednesday \"the government has no other option but to raise prices.\" \n\n  The price increases are intended to help state-run fuel retailers trim mounting losses. The rise will save India's three state-run retailers -- Indian Oil Corp., Hindustan Petroleum Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. -- about $5 billion through increased revenue this fiscal year, Petroleum Secretary M.S. Srinivasan said. However, the companies are expected to continue to lose money. \n\n  Morgan Stanley economist Chetan Ahya calculates that the fuel-price increase and other measures will reduce India's combined central and state governments' fiscal deficit to about 8.9% of GDP in the current fiscal year from his earlier estimate of 9.3%. Mr. Ahya's estimates include budgeted central and state government spending, along with other items not officially included in their budgets -- such as a recent huge loan waiver for small-scale farmers. In the last fiscal year, which ended March 31, India's official fiscal deficit, by government calculations, was equal to 3.1% of GDP. This fiscal year, the government aims to cut that to 2.5%. \n\n  In Malaysia, fuel price increases will lift the cost of gasoline to 2.70 ringgit, or about 84 U.S. cents, a liter from 1.92 ringgit, while diesel will increase 63% to 2.58 ringgit a liter. Prices will then be reviewed on a monthly basis, officials said. To cushion the impact of the increases, the government will give owners of small and medium-size cars a yearly 625 ringgit rebate, enough to cover the price increase for up to 800 liters. \n\n  Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whose ruling Barisan Nasional coalition had its worst election performance in nearly four decades in March, dismissed suggestions the latest price rises could make the government more unpopular. \"It has to be done. It's not an attempt to be popular. We can't satisfy everyone,\" he told reporters. \n\n  Subsidies in Malaysia, introduced in 1983, have kept its fuel prices among the lowest in Southeast Asia. But the surge in global oil prices has made the subsidies too onerous for the government. Had Wednesday's price increases not been introduced, Malaysia's fuel-subsidy bill would have reached around 50 billion ringgit this year, or about one-third of government budget expenditures. With the price increase, the government expects to save 13.7 billion ringgit, part of which will be used to help subsidize rising food prices. \n\n  --- \n\n  Vibhuti Agarwal and Krishna Pokharel in

continue to monitor all developments \"very closely\" and its Thursday rate hike will help to fend off second-round inflation effects, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told the European Parliament Wednesday. \n\n  Trichet said the \"first signs of\" materializing second-round effects were already visible in some of the 15 countries that share the euro currency. He added that in view of this, it was vital to abandon inflation-indexed wage setting schemes. \n\n  In the German government bond market, the bund yield curve inverted further Wednesday after ECB President Trichet warned of the risk of prolonged high inflation in the euro-zone economy. \n\n  The comments weighed on the front end of the yield curve, which currently prices in an accommodative ECB stance, BNP Paribas' brokerage said. \n\n  Trichet said risks to consumer price inflation would \"prevail\" at present and that the rise in the consumer price index is likely to moderate only gradually next year. \n\n  June inflation accelerated to 4%, according to the Eurostat flash-estimate, and is unlikely to fall back below 3% during the remainder of the year due to surging oil prices. \n\n  Trichet said such inflation levels were \"worrying.\" \n\n  The ECB raised its key interest rate to 4.25% from 4% Thursday, after keeping it steady since June 2007 despite global market turmoil. \n\n  \"This action underlines the Governing Council's strong determination to prevent second-round effects and maintain longer-term inflation expectations (are) firmly anchored,\" Trichet said. \n\n  The ECB fears that rising commodity and oil prices could prompt people to anticipate further gains in inflation, thereby triggering a wage-price spiral. \n\n  Companies, ranging from producers of intermediate goods to consumer product and car makers, said recently they will raise their prices, due to high oil, energy and steel prices. \n\n  In turn, some labor unions are likely to increase their pay claims, arguing that high inflation is reducing workers' purchasing power. \n\n  Trichet said the central bank's rate hike was \"the contribution of the ECB's monetary policy to preserving purchasing power over the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area.\" \n\n  Some E.U. parliamentarians criticized Trichet for not mentioning the negative effects that a higher ECB interest rate will have on economic growth in his speech as the hike curtails access to credit for both firms and households. \n\n  The chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker, however, defended the ECB's monetary policy, arguing the central bank was acting in accordance with its mandate to preserve price stability. \n\n \n   ECB Web site: www.ecb.int \n \n\n  -By Roman Kessler, Dow Jones Newswires, +4969 2972 5514, roman.kessler@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=%2FQa2nu6jewX%2BxOyI7SEPCw%3D%3D.

Wen had acknowledged in March that the CPI target would be hard to meet. \n\n  The CPI in January-May rose 8.1% from the same period last year, exceeding the 4.8% gain last year. \n\n  Wen's comments and remarks by other senior officials over the weekend suggest Beijing is unlikely to ease efforts to add more value to China-made export goods, boost domestic consumption and develop its service industries, despite concerns that a U.S. economic slowdown and surging global prices of oil and commodities will hurt Chinese companies. \n\n  \"We need to accelerate the mode of growth in external trade, improve the structure of imports and exports, and raise the core competitiveness of exports in the market,\" a statement on the central government's Web site cited Wen as saying. Wen was visiting both areas from Friday to Sunday, to learn about the economic situation there. \n\n  In the past two years, Beijing has cut rebates on export taxes for thousands of products, particularly those whose manufacture requires a lot of energy and emits a lot of pollution. It has restricted exports in the processing trade - where firms import raw materials to make products for duty-free exports. And it has allowed the yuan to rise, encouraging domestic consumption but hurting exports. \n\n  Echoing the call for a restructuring of Chinese exports, Vice Premier Wang Qishan was reported by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying: \"The model of crude external-trade growth of the past is hard to sustain. We need to ... boost the efficiency of companies and their competitiveness.\" \n\n  Both men encouraged the development of China's service industry, particularly the financial sector. \n\n  Wen reiterated China's goal of making Shanghai a global financial hub, and said the city should aim to become a shipping hub for northeast Asia. \n\n  Xinhua cited Wang, responsible for the financial sector, as saying China needs to boost its financial services. \n\n  \"Preventing risks is the financial sector's eternal main task,\" he said during a visit to the eastern province of Shandong from Thursday to Friday. He urged financial firms to \"pay close attention to all kinds of possible risks and maintain financial security and stability.\" \n\n \n\n  -By Terence Poon; Dow Jones Newswires; 8610 6588 5848; terence.poon@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=zWzWhyv77fAzXNFP%2BpXClA%3D%3D.

However, Bank of Scotland's currency strategist Naeem Wahid says this is not the beginning of a trend higher, instead it probably signals a period of consolidation, or a small upside correction. Wahid adds this correction could be deeper if it occurs with a simultaneous rally in commodities, although with oil unable to break out of its previous 1 week range this seems unlikely.

With markets now positioned for an interest rate cut later this year, Broux says any change to the three-way split vote (7-1-1) seen in July will determine near-term direction in financial markets. \"We still expect a three-way split but for another MPC member to join the call for lower rates,\" Broux adds.

RBS expects the minutes to show the MPC voted 7-1-1 in favor of leaving interest rates at 5.0%, the same split as seen in July.

for an overheating economy with double-digit inflation. \n\n  But the 0.1% monthly decline in the harmonized index of consumer prices, or HICP, still left Bulgaria's annual inflation at 11.8%, far above the central bank's forecast of an 8% rate by the end of the year as well as the government's 6.5% projection. \n\n  The inflation data were better than expected and the drop in food prices, linked to a rebound in the grain harvest, augurs well for calmer inflation ahead in the region. But the drop may not be fast or strong enough to offset an economic slowdown and the government's plans to spend down its budget surplus ahead of an election next year. \n\n  \"Only half the price increases are attributable to external factors beyond the control of Bulgarian authorities,\" said UniCredit economist Fabio Mucci. \n\n  Private-sector credit is booming at a 52% annual rate, wages are rising 25% a year and government expenditure on fuel and other subsidies have shot up more than 50% in the past year. Meanwhile, industrial production is slowing, as is demand in Bulgaria's European export markets. \n\n  Normally, higher central bank rates would be deployed to control an overheating economy. Romania, where inflation slowed to 8% in August, has a policy rate of 10.25%. But Bulgaria has a currency board that links its currency, the lev, to the euro and strips it of control over interest rates. \n\n  The central bank hasn't used its other policy tools, such as raising reserve requirements to curtail lending. Meanwhile, fiscal policy has been tight but will now be loosened as the government plans to offer new benefits such as free vacations and heating fuel subsidies for families. \n\n  Authorities seem to hope declining commodity prices will tame inflation, but it's more likely that will only happen as the economy slows over the next few years, said Mucci. \n\n  Food prices have declined for four months in a row, and their annual rate of growth in August was only 9.4% on the month, below the headline inflation rate and sharply down from the 24% jump on the year reported as recently as June, according to data from the statistics institute. \n\n  However, the planned stimulus may lift inflation more than growth, according to Mitko Dimitrov, an economist at the Bulgarian Academy of Science. Hasty short-term handouts are an inefficient use of the budget surplus because their likely aim is to boost current private spending, he said. \n\n  Cutting income, payroll and corporate taxes would be more effective because it would free resources to be used more productively, said Dimitar Chobanov, an analyst at the Institute of Market Economics in Sofia. \n\n  Lower oil prices may not offer much solace for Bulgaria, where Bulgargaz, the gas monopoly, this week asked for regulatory approval of 37% price hikes starting next month. The company claims local heating companies are failing to pay their bills, leaving it strapped for cash to import wholesale gas from Russia and build out its network. \n\n  Bulgargaz subsidies have put its financial stability at risk and cannot go on forever, which means that \"opportunities to cushion the impact of higher international gas prices on the local economy are decreasing,\" said UniCredit's Mucci. \n\n  Meanwhile, Bulgaria's main growth driver, construction and real estate, is showing signs of stalling. Foreign direct investment in the sector is in decline, which raises doubts about how the country can sustain a current-account deficit of more than 20% of gross domestic product. \n\n  There's a risk Bulgaria may lose its triple-B rating from Standard & Poor's, according to UniCredit. \n\n  Those doubts are increasingly evident in financial markets. The Sofix blue-chip index has lost more than 40% this year and is trading at two-year lows. \n\n  The cost of insuring Bulgarian sovereign debt against default for five years was 222 basis points on Thursday, according to data provider Markit. That's 47 basis points wider than a month ago and a whopping 190 basis points wider than a year ago. \n\n  \"There is a danger of an economic hard landing in Bulgaria,\" said Calyon strategist Simon Smollett, who expects growth to slow to 4.7% in 2009 from 6.6% this year. \n\n  The currency board will probably be kept, but it currently isn't helping, he and others noted. \n\n  With a euro peg, any decrease in capital inflows will automatically lead to the contraction of the local currency in circulation and trigger an abrupt economic crunch, according to Goldman Sachs, which noted that several Baltic states are now flirting with recession after double-digit GDP growth only a year ago. \n\n  The competitiveness of Bulgaria's lev \"requires a period of inflation below euro-zone inflation levels, which seems unlikely given the government's reluctance to squeeze the economy by increasing the budget surplus,\" Smollett said. \n\n  -By Christopher Emsden, Dow Jones Newswires;

To Decouple From Outside Mkts\n\n \n   (This article orginally was published on Friday) \n \n\n  By Andrew Johnson Jr. \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Bearish macroeconomic factors affecting inflationary markets and commodities in general are making it tough for corn and soybeans to decouple from outside markets despite lingering supply woes. \n\n  Commodity and inflationary markets have become extremely intertwined in recent years. And the slowing of the U.S. and global economies over the past several months has brought negative effects on prices that have been felt across commodities markets. \n\n  Outside commodities markets have to some degree become more of a focus than weather of trader attention, with traders watching what is happening in crude oil and the U.S. dollar before checking the weather, said Dan Basse, president of AgResource Co. \n\n  Weather is a key factor in the development of crops and is usually the primary influence during the summer growing season. \n\n  Corn and soybeans have a correlation with crude oil because of the alternative fuels ethanol and biodiesel, and that relationship makes energy an influence for corn and soy on a daily basis, traders said. In the U.S., ethanol is made primarily from corn while biodiesel is typically made from soyoil, which is produced when soybeans are crushed. \n\n  The slowing U.S and world economies have raised concerns about future export demand, as high prices spark fears of global curbed food demand, Basse said. \n\n  The grain market continues to look for a strong fundamental clue that will allow corn and soybeans to stand on their own feet, with a reduction in yield and production forecasts the latest feature to try to rescue the market from a recent downturn. \n\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's cut to yields and lowering of production on Friday should give grain and oilseed markets a lift, especially after recent losses, which have been seen across commodities markets. A rallying U.S. dollar and the exodus of index and hedge funds recently have pushed prices down sharply from all-time highs scored in 2008. \n\n  Futures did settle higher Friday, in part due to the report. Chicago Board of Trade December corn futures settled up the 30-cent, exchange-imposed trading limit at $5.63 1/4 a bushel. November soybeans settled 26 cents higher at $12.02 a bushel. \n\n  David Hightower, principal and founder of Hightower Report, said the sharp break in grain prices is directly related to the influence of outside markets, rather than prices falling because yields were expected to rise. \n\n  \"Because of the macroeconomic influences, this data won't be as powerfully bullish as it could be,\" Hightower said. \"But if the stock market stabilizes and crude oil bottoms, we could see inflation concerns coming back.\" \n\n  The market is in a corrective phase from overbought conditions experienced during corn and soybeans' historic run to all-time highs. Simple rationing of supplies have emerged, as once prices got too high, end-users adjusted their buying habits, and the world seemingly is using fewer commodities and producing nations are searching for demand, analysts said. \n\n  The market is readjusting downward, making it difficult for buyers to fight against a general bearish trend. \n\n  \"Commodities are cyclical, and we are in a bearish cyclical phase in the market, making it easy to sell-off on bearish news, particularly from outside-market factors,\" said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential Bache Commodities in New York. \n\n  The U.S. has a very tight domestic supply situation, but the \"U.S. is a bullish island in a bearish sea,\" as global inventories are not scarce, Frick said. \n\n  The world oilseed market has intrinsic bearish factors, with increased world rapeseed and sunseed production, larger Chinese soy crop prospects and India's soy crop seen up this year, Frick said. \n\n  The fall of the U.S. dollar over the past few years fueled the commodity boom. And amid the global economic woes, the soybean market seemingly overshot on the high side. That and a recently stronger dollar have opened the door for the current downside correction, analysts said. \n\n  However, an extremely tight soybean stock situation, with very few supplies in the hands of end-users, will continue to lend support, particularly with uncertainty surrounding 2008 yields. \n\n  Further yield reductions from USDA will force fundamentals back into the mainstream of market focus, said Dan Cekander, analyst with Newedge. \n\n  \"If you get U.S. soybean yields down to 39 or 38 bushels an acre, supply would be so tight and fundamentals so bullish, severe supply rationing would be needed and futures could decouple from bearish outside economic factors,\" Cekander added. \n\n \n\n  -By Andrew Johnson Jr., Dow Jones Newswires; 312-347-4604;

article was originally published Monday, Sept. 29.) \n\n \n\n  By Reuben Carder \n\n  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\n \n\n  JAKARTA (Dow Jones)--Indonesia's inflation likely sped up slightly in September due to higher fuel costs ahead of a major Islamic holiday, but inflation may have peaked last month, economists said. \n\n  A Dow Jones Newswires poll of 10 regional economists yielded a median forecast of an 11.99% on-year rise in the consumer price index and a 0.81% increase on month. \n\n  The CPI rose 11.85% on year and 0.51% on month in August. The Central Statistics Agency will release official inflation data Monday around 0630 GMT. \n\n  The Islamic fasting month of Ramadan ended last week and millions of people in Muslim-majority Indonesia had traveled extensively within the country and enjoyed lavish feasts to celebrate Idul Fitri or Eid-al-Fitr, the festivity that concludes the Ramadan month. \n\n  But the economists said food price controls and an ample supply of commodities may help keep a lid on festivity-related inflation this year, despite likely higher household fuel consumption coinciding with an increase in prices of kerosene and liquefied natural gas. \n\n  \"Inflation likely stayed elevated largely due to more pronounced passthrough effects from the fuel price hike in May and the hike in retail LPG prices in both early July (by 23.5%) and late August (by 9.5%),\" Citi economist Leon Hiew said. \n\n  Hiew added that \"inflation has peaked (in September) but would remain stubborn in coming off given persistent inflationary momentum from previous months.\" \n\n  The economists said a 20% increase in transport costs in July - after the government hiked gasoline and diesel prices by almost 29% in May - presents an inflation risk especially as transport usage spikes due to Idul Fitri. \n\n \nInstitution        CPI forecast \n                   On-Mo    On-Yr \nMandiri Sekuritas  +0.94%

construction materials fell from the previous month, indicating that the country's rampant inflation has peaked. \n\n  The consumer price index rose 26.72% from a year earlier in October after rising 27.9% in September, the Government Statistics Office said in a statement released Saturday. \n\n  Vietnam usually issues economic data based on estimates before the end of the reporting period. \n\n  The month-to-month rate of inflation will ease 0.19% in October, marking its smallest increase since March 2007. The CPI rose 0.2% in September from the previous month after rising 1.6% in August from July. \n\n  The government lowered retail diesel prices by a total 8.8% so far this month, following a decline in global crude oil prices. \n\n  The CPI rose 23.15% in the first 10 months of the year, the GSO said. \n\n  Food and food services prices are projected to have risen 40.6% from a year earlier and to be down 0.4% from the previous month. \n\n  Rice and other cereal prices are projected to have risen 60% from a year earlier and decreased 1.9% from September. \n\n  Housing and construction materials costs are estimated to have increased 22.8% from a year earlier and fallen 1.1% from September. \n\n  The statistics office said the U.S. dollar has risen 2.46% against the Vietnamese dong since October last year.

\n\n  SANTIAGO (Dow Jones)--The Chilean central bank Thursday held the key TPM interest rate steady at 8.25%, in line with analysts' consensus. \n\n  This was the third consecutive month the central bank opted to leave the TPM at its highest nominal level since the bank switched to a nominal monetary-policy rate in August 2001. \n\n  \"This decision is line with the recently revised base scenario in the four-month Monetary Policy Report, due to the significant change seen in the global economy and its impact on projected inflation,\" the bank said in a statement. \n\n  The monetary authority also said it would likely begin a rate-easing process in coming months, but that the pace of this process \"will depend on the inflation outlook.\" \n\n  The central bank acknowledged that inflation in November fell on lower fuel prices but that core inflation remains high. \n\n  Chile's consumer price index fell 0.1% in November, government statistics agency INE said last week, mostly on a significant drop in the price of unleaded fuel, a heavily weighted component in the CPI. This brought annual inflation down to 8.9% from a 14-year high of 9.9% the previous month. Despite the drop, annual inflation is still running well above the central bank's target of 3%, plus or minus one percentage point. \n\n  While headline inflation fell, core inflation, which factors out volatile fuel and produce prices, rose to an annualized 9.5% from 9.3%. \n\n  On the domestic front, the central bank said unemployment levels remain stable and local credit markets are tight. It added economic activity is showing signs of deceleration, while domestic demand, especially for imported goods, is lower than expected. \n\n  Regarding the international economy, the central bank said access to credit is still \"showing tension, and the most recent data available confirms a significant deceleration in the global economy.\" \n\n  The bank noted that commodities prices, especially copper and crude-oil prices, have continued to drop. \n\n  The monetary authority reiterated its commitment to managing monetary policy so as to bring inflation back down to its target of 3% in its 24-month policy horizon. \n\n \n\n  Central bank web site: http://www.bcentral.cl \n\n \n\n  -By Carolina Pica, Dow Jones Newswires; 56-2-820-4244; carolina.pica@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=OBSC4tG5tv93CjIHwO9G9A%3D%3D.

Thank Fiscal Stimulus. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Jacob Sonenshine \n\n     The three major U.S. stock indexes were mixed Thursday, but beneath the surface, there was strength in the market. \n\n     The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 68.95 points, or 0.22%, to close at 30,991.52. The S&P 500 slid 14.30 points, or 0.38%, to end at 3,795.54, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.31 points, or 0.12%, to close at 13,112.64. The biggest gainer in the S&P 500 was petroleum refiner HollyFrontier (ticker: HFC), with an 11% stock surge. \n\n     President-elect Joe Biden is expected to speak in the evening in detail about fiscal stimulus. Trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus have already shored up consumers' savings, and a few trillion dollars more would add to the pent-up demand that could be unleashed when Covid-19 vaccines are widely distributed. \n\n     Investors remain upbeat about the trajectory of the economy. While the major indexes were down, stocks most sensitive to perceived changes in the economy, such as value and small-caps, were up. The market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 was dragged lower by megacap tech stocks including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), which fell 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. \n\n     But the Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index Fund ETF (VOOV) rose 0.37%. The Russell 2000, an index of small-caps, rose 2%. Small-caps are not only expected to see roughly twice the earnings rebound than large caps will see in 2021, but the smaller names also still trade at a valuation discount to larger ones, giving small-caps even more upside potential. \n\n     The average Russell 2000 component stock still trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple roughly in line with the average stock on the Russell 1000, which includes some S&P 500 stocks, according to figures from UBS Wealth Management. Historically, the average Russell 2000 forward P/E multiple has a slight premium to that of the Russell 1000, suggesting that there's some upside for the smaller caps of the former. \n\n     \"I am far more pleased to be holding an overweight in small-caps right now,\" Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede, told Barron's. \n\n     Another signal of optimism on the economy: the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which reflects how broadly -- across sectors -- stocks rallied, rose 0.36%. \n\n     Investors are seeing \"more of the commitment to stimulus and the magnitude of stimulus that will be introduced and most likely passed and the fact that it seems to have bipartisan support,\" Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, told Barron's. \n\n     A report from Evercore strategists noted the reasons Treasury yields rose was because there are reports that Biden's stimulus plan could total $2 trillion, higher than some calls of late for $1 trillion. Rising treasury yields usually reflect rising inflation and economic expectations. \n\n     Negatively, initial jobless claims came in worse than expected, although investors shrugged that off. Claims came in at 965,000 for last week, larger than the consensus average for 800,000, and larger than the previous week's revised tally of 784,000, as lockdowns persisted. \n\n     \"At a certain point tough jobs numbers like we saw this morning can serve as the tinder for those calling for a correction, but the market's view seems to be that the light at the end of the tunnel remains in sight, despite a plodding vaccination rollout.\" Mike Loewengart, head of investment strategy at E*Trade, wrote in emailed remarks to the media. \n\n     Write to Jacob Sonenshine at

in Cairo and Caitlin Ostroff in London \n\n     Turkey's newly appointed central bank governor sought to reassure markets on Sunday as investors braced for turmoil following the abrupt firing of his predecessor by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \n\n     Sahap Kavcioglu, a former member of parliament from Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party who was named to the post late Friday, said the bank's main objective is to achieve \"a permanent fall in inflation.\" \n\n     In a statement, Mr. Kavcioglu outlined the importance of tackling inflation, saying it \"will foster macroeconomic stability\" by lowering borrowing costs and reducing \"country risk premiums,\" helping set the stage for sustainable growth. \n\n     The change in command atop the central bank -- a day after it again raised interest rates -- prompted concern among economists and investors about the trajectory of the economy in Turkey, an aspiring global power whose influence extends through the Middle East, Europe and beyond. \n\n     The previous governor, Naci Agbal, who was appointed in November of last year, had repeatedly raised interest rates in an effort to tame inflation. His dismissal has prompted concerns that his successor could move less aggressively to tighten monetary policy. \n\n     Mr. Kavcioglu, who had been working as a columnist at a pro-government newspaper, has publicly sided with Mr. Erdogan's preference for lower interest rates. \n\n     Economists were predicting a steep drop in the value of the Turkish lira when markets open on Monday morning, as investors move to scale back their exposure to Turkish assets until the likely course of policy becomes clearer. \n\n     \"It will cause chaos for the Turkish economy. You will see tomorrow morning when the markets are open,\" said Durmus Yilmaz, a former governor of the Turkish central bank and currently a member of parliament with the centrist opposition Iyi party. \n\n     A sharp decline in the value of Turkey's currency would ratchet up inflation, raise the cost of imported goods including oil, and hurt living standards for ordinary Turks, economists warned. \n\n     \"It really is puzzling. It makes no economic sense whatsoever,\" said Refet Gurkaynak, a leading Turkish economist at Bilkent University in Ankara, referring to Mr. Agbal's removal. \n\n     The firing of Mr. Agbal was the third time Mr. Erdogan has replaced a central bank chief in less than two years. Before the bank chief's ouster, the Turkish economy was already struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic, which wiped out tourism and slowed international trade, as well as a currency crisis that began in 2018. \n\n     The changer also comes as Mr. Erdogan has expanded his power within Turkey's political and economic system and asserted Turkey's influence abroad, intervening in wars in Syria, Libya, and the Caucasus region in recent years. \n\n     Within Turkey, the government is also intensifying a clampdown on some of Mr. Erdogan's opponents. Last week, a top Ankara prosecutor called for the banning of one of Turkey's largest political parties, the leftist People's Democratic Party, which the government accuses of having ties to a Kurdish militant group that is banned as a terrorist organization. \n\n     In the same set of decrees in which he fired Mr. Agbal, Mr. Erdogan withdrew Turkey from an international treaty known as the Istanbul Convention designed to combat violence against women, sparking criticism from women's groups and a rebuke from President Biden. Mr. Biden called the decision \"a disheartening step backward for the international movement to end violence against women globally.\" \n\n     After years of unpredictable policy-making, Mr. Agbal's tenure inspired confidence from foreign investors. When Mr. Agbal began raising interest rates last year, investors poured a net $4.6 billion back into Turkish lira assets. Turkey remains dependent on foreign funds to finance its current-account deficit. \n\n     As a result, Mr. Agbal's removal surprised investors and economists. The most recent interest rate increase came on March 18, when the bank lifted its benchmark rate to 19% from 17%, triggering a surge in the value of the lira. \n\n     The rate increases put Mr. Agbal at odds with Mr. Erdogan, who has repeatedly expressed a preference for low interest rates, espousing the unorthodox view that high interest rates lead to inflation. \"I don't believe my country will develop with high interest rates,\" he said in a speech to a business group in January. \n\n     The new central bank chief, Mr. Kavcioglu, also criticized the rate increases in his newspaper columns, fueling concerns among investors that he will reverse Mr. Agbal's policies. \n\n     \"There's a disappointment to the investment case that a lot of people, including me, were building that there would be a cap on inflation and now that looks much less likely,\" said Kieran Curtis, an emerging-markets fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. \n\n     The surprise change at the central bank is also fueling anxieties among some regular Turkish people who are worried about the country's economic and political trajectory. \n\n     \"In general, there is a problem with stability in the country.\" said Cihan Ilter, the 35-year-old manager of two restaurants in Istanbul. \n\n     \"In the past, this wasn't so. We felt the effects of such higher level economic decisions, perhaps in a year or more. But now, because Turkish economy is very fragile, we feel the effects immediately,\" he said. \n\n     The decision is also likely to have a long-lasting impact on the credibility of Turkey's central bank, making it difficult to assuage concerns over higher inflation and price stability, said Maya Senussi, a senior economist at Oxford Economics. \n\n     Under Mr. Agbal's predecessor, Murat Uysal, cheap lending rates intended to boost growth created gaping holes in the country's current account as Turkish businesses and households imported more than they exported. \n\n     Concerns over the current-account deficit and interest rates below that of inflation caused foreign investors to pull a net $13.4 billion out of local currency bonds and stocks in the first 10 months of 2020. \n\n     The capital flight accelerated the lira's decline. The central bank opted to sell foreign currencies, from its own reserves and dollars borrowed from domestic banks, to buy the lira. \n\n     \"Like many people I'm pretty flabbergasted,\" said Erik Meyersson, a senior economist at Swedish bank Handelsbanken. \"Because of the appointment of Agbal, you've gotten investors to come back and that's pretty extraordinary. Now those portfolio flows, they will most likely reverse.\" \n\n     Write to Jared Malsin at jared.malsin@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones

In a virtual question-and-answer session before a restaurant industry group, Schembri says there will still be disagreements on some matters, such as Buy American policies and the scrapping of the Keystone XL pipeline project.

The ECB announced that it would significantly ramp up pandemic bond purchases over the coming quarter to curb rising yields. \"Not only does today's ECB decision help to limit the key USD tailwind of late (sharply rising U.S. Treasury yields), but as the eurozone economy starts to recover in the second quarter (with the pace of vaccination set to increase), EUR/USD should start moving higher, further helped by the deeply negative U.S. front-end real [inflation-adjusted] rates,\" ING currency strategist Petr Krpata says.

Brazil's statistics agency says consumer prices rose 5.2% in February from a year earlier, a level close to the upper edge of the central-bank's target range of 2.25% to 5.25%. Bank of America says it raised its forecast for the 2021 consumer price index to 4.6% from 4% because of the recent upside pressure on prices. Bank of America says the 12-month rate should begin to decline in 2H because of the Brazilian economy's wide output gap.

That was up from December, and continued a rising trend as the economy slowly opened further after spring 2020 shutdowns. But the level was down from 7.2M in January 2020. And even if jobs opened in January 2021 were filled, there would still be about 2.5M fewer positions on US payrolls than before the pandemic began. Job openings rose in January in health care, manufacturing and warehouse jobs, but fell in food service and local government jobs, excluding schools. (eric.morath@wsj.com) \n\n  1100 ET - The move taken by the European Central Bank isn't only the answer to higher bond yields but probably also the outcome of a controversial discussion at the ECB's Governing Council, Carsten Brzeski, ING's global head of macro, says. There are three main takeaways from today's ECB meeting, he says: First, the ECB will look through any temporary acceleration of inflation and expects inflation to slow down again next year; second, the ECB will front-load asset purchases in the coming months to underline its willingness to look through higher inflation and limit further bond yield increases; and third, the change of the balance of risk for the economic outlook suggests that any increase in the total size of the asset purchases is still far out and unlikely.

Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day. \n\n  0819 GMT - Gold prices are edging lower in volatile trading as investors worry about whether inflation will push the Federal Reserve to tighten policy sooner than planned. Comex gold futures pare earlier gains and fall 0.5% to $1,814.30 a tory ounce. Stronger than expected signs of U.S. inflation have spooked the market. Investors fear strong inflation could prompt the central back to raise interest rates. However, Fed officials have stressed that they still think inflation will be fleeting, likely easing downward pressure on gold, says HSBC. Gold is likely to be volatile until June, when the Fed updates its inflation projections, the bank says. (william.horner@wsj.com) \n\n  0803 GMT - Better-than-forecast U.K. economic growth in March underscores the positive outlook for sterling and expected solid data this quarter should support the currency, ING says. \"We expect EUR/GBP to re-test the 0.8500 level in the coming weeks,\" ING analysts say. EUR/GBP rises 0.2% to 0.8604 and GBP/USD falls 0.1% to 1.4046. Sterling long positions, which expect the currency to strengthen, should start rising again after a recent trimming of those bets in the week to May 4, the analysts say, citing the latest CFTC data. Data on Wednesday showed the U.K. economy grew by 2.1% in March compared to a month ago, versus the 1.5% growth expected by economists in a WSJ survey. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0755 GMT - The rise in U.S. Treasury yields after Wednesday's release of higher-than-expected inflation in April was significant, \"but surely much smaller than would have occurred had investors interpreted the upside surprise as the beginnings of a more sinister trend,\" says Daiwa Capital Markets. Consumer prices rose 4.2% on the year in April, accelerating from 2.6% in March, and coming way above economists' consensus forecast of 3.6% in The Wall Street Journal's survey. The 10- and 30-year Treasury yields closed approximately seven basis points higher at 1.69% and 2.41%, respectively, and these are \"significant increases,\" Daiwa CM says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0752 GMT - Rolls-Royce's update for the first four months of 2021 shows that the firefighting is over and stability has been established, Jefferies says. The British engineering company's large engine flying hours were at 40% of their 2019 level in the period, exceeding Jefferies's expectations. Operational data from airlines like IAG and Lufthansa gave no reason to believe that engine flying hours had improved so Rolls-Royce's performance is better than expected, the bank says. \"What we need now is the promise of North Atlantic travel re-opening. Then, the picture could quickly look much brighter, in our view,\" it says. Jefferies has a buy rating and a 130 pence target price on the stock. Shares are down 1.4%, at 103.40 pence. (anthony.orunagoriainoff@dowjones.com) \n\n  0749 GMT - Revisions to the European Commission's forecasts, which was the case on Wednesday, \"are often a good indicator of change in the European Central Bank's own forecasts,\" says RBC Capital Markets. The EU Commission raised its forecast for the eurozone's GDP in 2021 and 2022 to 4.3% and 4.4%, respectively, from just 3.8% previously in both years. \"Yesterday's updated forecasts from the Commission thus suggest that the ECB is likely to upgrade its 2021 and 2022 projections, from 4.0% y/y and 4.1% y/y, respectively, at the June meeting,\" RBCCM says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0723 GMT - The 10-year German Bund yield is likely to touch the 0% level during the summer, says Danske Bank's chief strategist Piet Haines Christiansen. However, he wants to see a sustainable pickup in inflation before turning structurally bearish on bonds, he says. \"For me to turn structurally bearish on rates it would require an outlook with a sustainable pickup in inflation dynamics--also shared among households and corporates and not 'just' markets,\" he says. To actually pull inflation higher a tight labor market, including sizeable wage increases, is also required, he says. Danske still doesn't see inflation in the eurozone, \"so it may take a while before I structurally can see Bunds in e.g. +0.5%,\" Christiansen says. The 10-year Bund yield last trades at -0.127%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0721 GMT - U.S. consumer spending was strong at the end of the first quarter and sets the tone for a summer boom, says Gregory Daco chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. As health conditions improve and the economy reopens, generous fiscal stimulus, rebounding employment, and rising optimism will help unleash pent-up demand, he says. Oxford Economics projects real consumption growth of 9.6% for this year, which would mark the strongest performance since 1946, and 5.1% for 2022. While the outlook is on the high side of consensus expectations, risks are still tilted to the upside, he says. \"Should consumers spend 45% of their excess savings over the next 18 months, in line with the marginal propensity to spend out of income, real GDP could be 2.5% higher than in our baseline in 2022,\" Daco says. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) \n\n  0718 GMT - With the start of the 2021 travel season in Europe on the horizon, a rebound in travel prices is expected to boost inflation later in the year, Goldman Sachs says. As both demand and the timing of 2021's tourism season are highly uncertain, Goldman Sachs has constructed three scenarios. In its baseline, travel prices recover somewhat this year, with travel price inflation reaching about 5% year-on-year in autumn. An upside scenario in which travel prices reach levels seen during the strong 2018 tourism season would add 10 basis points to eurozone core inflation in September. A downside scenario where this year's season is comparable to the 2020 season would take around 20 basis points off core inflation in autumn, Goldman Sachs says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0716 GMT - The dollar's fluctuation after a sharper-than-expected rise in April U.S. consumer prices suggests investors are torn between deciding whether higher inflation is good or bad for the currency, Commerzbank says. \"The main reason for this is because it isn't clear how the [Federal Reserve] will react to particular levels of inflation,\" Commerzbank's Thu Lan Nguyen says. Speculation that the Fed could scale back stimulus will grow if U.S. inflation continues to accelerate above expectations, she says. The dollar initially rose after data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices jumped 4.2% year-on-year in April before correcting lower then ending the day higher. The DXY dollar index last falls 0.1% to 90.6470 and EUR/USD rises 0.2% to 1.2099. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0714 GMT - The next round of government-bond syndications in the eurozone is likely to focus on the 10-year maturity segment, Commerzbank's rates strategists Hauke Siemssen and Rainer Guntermann say. They see Finland and Spain as countries likely to embark on new issues before the summer. Prior to any syndicated issues, though, both countries are set to line up for bond auctions next week, with the two scheduled to reveal auction details Friday. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0709 GMT - The market is pricing in the first interest rate increase by the European Central Bank in the second quarter of 2023, which is far too soon, says Danske Bank. The market prices the euro short-term rate at 10 basis points higher in that period, says Danske's chief strategist Piet Haines Christiansen. \"It's way too early to discuss rate hikes-even in 2023,\" he says. He attributes the rise in the euro short-term rate over the past month primarily to higher bond yields. The 10-year German Bund yield last trades 0.5 basis points lower at -0.127%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0708 GMT - Over a quarter of adults in the European Union are vaccine hesitant, with 29% of men and 25% of women indicating that they were either \"very unlikely\" or \"rather unlikely\" to take the Covid-19 vaccine, a Eurofound's survey shows. The survey found an association between vaccine hesitancy and social-media use, particularly when social media is the main source of information, Eurofound says. The intention to get vaccinated varies considerably among member states, with an east-west divide. With the exceptions of Austria and France, the intention to get vaccinated is over 60% for all western member states, while among eastern states the rate is lower, ranging from 59% in Romania to 33% in Bulgaria, the survey shows.

Supply constraints threaten to slow countries' plans to reduce emissions and make them more expensive, they say. \n\n     Though off their highs, many mined commodities have hit record prices this year as the global economy bounces back from Covid-19, governments increase spending on infrastructure and supply stutters for some resources. For instance, the price of copper -- used in construction and to conduct electricity -- has almost doubled over the past 12 months to a record of $10,762 a metric ton earlier this month. \n\n     But miners have been reluctant to invest in new projects, analysts and executives say, because their investors have in recent years wanted higher dividends after seeing the sector burn through cash during the last commodity bull run. That hesitancy is now raising the specter of supply crunches. \n\n     \"We are starting to see some pinch points appear in the key energy-transition metals, copper and platinum group metals for example, where there is very little new supply ready to fill the gap,\" says Anglo American PLC Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pearce. \n\n     \"You have to continuously reinvest to keep filling your resources cupboard, and it takes many years to bring new mines to fruition,\" he adds. London-listed Anglo has been among the bigger spenders on new and existing projects in recent years. \n\n     Overall, though, spending across the industry isn't keeping pace with demand and is expected to lead to shortfalls for many resources, analysts say. Capital spending is set to fall by 6% among major diversified mining companies and 10% among copper miners this year, according to analysts' consensus. \n\n     Meanwhile, the total demand for copper is forecast to increase 40% by 2030 -- with so-called green demand jumping by as much as 900% -- according to Goldman Sachs Group, leaving a supply shortfall of 8.2 million metric tons. Even as copper prices have rallied over the past 12 months, no material new mines have been approved, it added. \n\n     At current metal prices, Rio Tinto PLC, BHP Group Ltd., Anglo American and Glencore PLC could this year generate a combined $140 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Royal Bank of Canada. That compares with $44 billion in 2015, a year when metals prices were at or near lows. \n\n     To be sure, there has been investment in some areas of mining, particularly in the iron ore market. But miners' focus has been on returning cash to investors. \n\n     Capital expenditure, including money spent on current and future production, rose 30% to $75 billion last year among 45 of the world's largest miners, according to investment bank Liberum, while dividends nearly doubled to $66.1 billion. The capital spend was a third lower than in 2012, at the end of the last commodity bull run, while dividends were 125% higher, Liberum says. \n\n     Miners are returning more money to investors, analysts and executives say, after overspending on projects and acquisitions during that last run, which lasted for a decade. Investors then deserted the sector, some miners went bankrupt, and many chief executives lost their jobs. \n\n     \"Investors remain very conscious the last bear cycle was driven by an overbuild of new capacity,\" says Robert Crayfourd, who invests in miners at London-based fund CQS New City Investment Managers. \"The point is here, that maybe they are being too cautious.\" \n\n     Some miners admit there isn't enough cash being spent on new projects. \n\n     \"Our industry's capital discipline and decline in exploration success over a number of years means there are fewer high-quality growth projects in the industry pipeline to meet this demand,\" BHP's Chief Executive Mike Henry told an industry conference last week. \n\n     Barrick Gold Corp. CEO Mark Bristow has recently complained that investor clamor for dividends means the industry isn't replacing what is being mined. \n\n     While analysts expect miners to start investing more in new projects if commodity prices remain elevated, mines typically take 10 to 15 years to develop. That has prompted some analysts and executives to worry that shortfalls could hurt governments' attempts to drive down carbon emissions. \n\n     To achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, there needs to be a quadrupling of the supply of minerals needed for clean-energy technologies by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency. The Biden administration this year rejoined the accord, which calls for cutting emissions enough to limit the rise in global temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. \n\n     \"The data shows a looming mismatch between the world's strengthened climate ambitions and the availability of critical minerals that are essential to realizing those ambitions,\" Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, said in a report last month. \n\n     For instance, the Paris-based energy watchdog says expected supply from existing mines and projects under construction is estimated to meet only half of projected lithium and cobalt requirements by 2030. Both metals are key components of batteries for electric cars and energy storage. \n\n     \"This will likely mean that decarbonization could cost more than is currently estimated and will be a structurally inflationary force for some time,\" says Tyler Broda, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada. \n\n     Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones

WSJ\n\nBy Anna Hirtenstein \n\n  This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (June 12, 2021). \n\n     The cheapest dollars in years are spurring a rise in foreign investment in U.S. government bonds at the same time that pension funds are boosting their holdings -- and that demand pickup could weigh on Treasury rates even as the economy strengthens. \n\n     The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, is down 2.4% this quarter so far and hovering close to the lowest level in about five months. The price of hedging dollars through forward rates also was the cheapest in at least six years last week and remains close by, according to analysis from Deutsche Bank. \n\n     \"If I were to buy a bond market, which is the case for a lot of investors, I would buy the U.S. Treasury,\" said Laurent Crosnier, chief investment officer of Amundi's London branch, Europe's largest asset manager. The positive yield and low hedging cost \"makes the U.S. Treasury attractive relative to others.\" \n\n     The benchmark 10-year government bond yield slipped below 1.5% earlier this past week, closing at 1.462% on Friday -- near its lowest level since March 3. Prices rise when yields fall. \n\n     Government bonds are popular in times of poorer economic performance for safety and liquidity. The recovery from the pandemic is widely expected to result in fund managers cutting their holdings as they position their portfolios for better times and less uncertainty. \n\n     Investors are widely expecting an increase in inflation from a combination of pent-up demand, supply constraints and stimulus spending. This is also seen as negative for conventional bonds, whose fixed cash flows lose purchasing power when prices rise. \n\n     Despite this, recent Treasury bond auctions have seen an uptick in demand from foreign investors. A 5-year debt sale on May 26 received the most bids from overseas investors since August at over 64%. A 7-year issuance in the same week saw the most since January. The latest data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed that major foreign investors upped their holdings of longer-maturity U.S. government bonds in March. \n\n     The dollar depreciation is linked to the high levels of liquidity in the market from a combination of Federal Reserve stimulus and colossal fiscal spending from the White House, analysts said. \n\n     Cash holdings have ballooned during Covid-19 lockdowns, with deposits at commercial banks in the U.S. sitting at a record $17.1 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. Assets in money-market funds total $4.6 trillion, according to the Investment Company Institute, which is close to record levels. \n\n     U.S. money-market yields have come under pressure from the excess liquidity, with some pushed toward zero. \n\n     Forward rates, which are used to lock in an exchange rate at a certain point in the future and reduce the risk of currency fluctuations, are priced based on money-market rates and the difference between yields in the two currencies' domestic short-term debt markets. The smaller the gap, the cheaper the trade -- and that is just what has happened as the U.S. rates have come down. \n\n     \"If you take a 10-year U.S. Treasury and you hedge with a three-month forward, the yield you get is around 0.9%,\" said Althea Spinozzi, a fixed-income strategist at Saxo Bank. \n\n     That is higher than all European government bonds of the same maturity. Italy's 10-year bond yield was 0.693% on Friday. Japan's equivalent bond yielded 0.030%. \n\n     To be sure, many analysts are expecting Treasury yields to tick up as U.S. economic growth and inflation pick up. The median of 47 estimates projects that the benchmark 10-year government bond yield will reach 1.90% by the end of the year, according to data from FactSet. \n\n     \"That means that if you were to act on that trade now, that second selloff could wipe out the carry returns you were hoping to make,\" said Ralf Preusser, a fixed-income strategist at Bank of America. \n\n     \"We think the selloff in dollar rates will be slower and more gradual once we hit 2% for the 10-year. That is where we expect this to start kicking in, with flows from European and Japanese investors,\" he said. \n\n     Another source of money flowing into Treasurys has been pension funds. Strong rallies in riskier assets, like stocks, in recent months helped to close the shortfall many funds have between the value of their assets and their liabilities, allowing them to move cash into safer assets, like bonds. \n\n     U.S. pension funds shifted nearly $90 billion of funds out of stocks and into fixed income during the first quarter of this year, $41 billion of which went into Treasurys, according to analysts at Bank of America. \n\n     These flows have helped to hold down yields, but Mike Bell, global markets strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said he expects 10-year yields to rise to about 2% over the next 12 months -- and that level would lure even more investment flows. \n\n     \"The rise in yields from there will be a lot slower and Treasurys will be much more attractive,\" he said. \n\n     Paul J. Davies contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 12, 2021 02:32 ET (06:32 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.898389Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T22:40:18.570584Z", "inner_id": 71, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7704, "annotations": [{"id": 6842, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 673, "end": 691, "text": "supply bottlenecks", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "893599", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 859, "end": 877, "text": "eurozone inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "776459", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 897, "end": 899, "text": "2%", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "879218", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 948, "end": 966, "text": "price expectations", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "243148", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1096, "end": 1108, "text": "Base effects", "labels": ["Base Effect"]}, "id": "398369", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1112, "end": 1125, "text": "energy prices", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "310908", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1146, "end": 1164, "text": "headline inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "410515", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1321, "end": 1339, "text": "transitory factors", "labels": ["Pent-up Demand"]}, "id": "728735", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3543, "end": 3559, "text": "supply shortages", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "815537", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4287, "end": 4299, "text": "vaccinations", "labels": ["Medical Costs"]}, "id": "840208", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 8118, "end": 8124, "text": "dollar", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "744566", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 8347, "end": 8366, "text": "market expectations", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "509643", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 8406, "end": 8412, "text": "dollar", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "459401", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"from_id": "398369", "to_id": "410515", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-27T22:51:04.625799Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T22:51:04.625812Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 643.452, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 14, "unique_id": "25dbc44c-a633-4ff3-8249-668c7c08bcde", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7704, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2131, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2131], "data": {"inner_id": 389, "text": "Global Equities Roundup: Market Talk\n\n   The latest Market Talks covering Equities.

In building construction, 43.9% of companies reported in May that they were having problems procuring construction materials in time, up from 23.9% in April and just 5.6% in March, according to data by the Ifo Institute. Civil engineering was slightly less affected, with 33.5% of companies reporting shortages in the month, up from 11.5% in April. \"Capacity utilization in the industry is still high, but supply bottlenecks are causing worries for more and more companies,\" says Felix Leiss, survey expert at the Ifo Institute. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0950 GMT - The flash estimate for eurozone inflation for May came in at 2%on year and Oxford Economics says recent data on price expectations and signs of a strong rebound in economic activity in the eurozone suggest some upside risks to the inflation outlook this year. Base effects in energy prices continue to push up headline inflation and Rory Fennessy, assistant economist at Oxford Economics, expects this trend to continue. \"Overall, we expect inflation this year to be largely driven by transitory factors, and although core price pressures will pick up, these will continue to remain largely subdued,\" the economist says.(maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0941 GMT - Singapore shares ended higher, supported by bank and consumer-product stocks.

Firstly, the building-and-insulation materials company's completion of the credit facility confirms its credentials as an extremely strong financial structure with plenty of opportunities, the Irish research firm says. Secondly, it shows that Kingspan is committed to dealing with the many environmental challenges facing the world, Davy says. \"Linking both is a willingness to be measured on the targets that have been embedded in its Planet Passionate strategy via the pricing of the new facility,\" the firm says. Davy retains its outperform rating. Shares are down 1.1% at 77.28 pence.

Orders also might be particularly high now because businesses have learned of supply shortages and are panic buying in response, Tombs says. The upswing in manufacturing is set to run out of steam soon and by the end of the year output is expected to fall back, he says.

The adjusted unemployment rate was at 6.0% in May, unchanged from April, and Koehler-Geib says unemployment will fall noticeably and the number of people on short-time contracts will drop sharply by summer. However, for the labor market and for the economy as a whole to make a sustained recovery, she says vaccinations are essential. \"If hotels, restaurants, stationary retailers and cultural and sports venues open their doors again across Germany, consumption will pick up,\" she says, explaining that this surge in consumption would be \"a turbo igniter for the economy.\" (maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0928 GMT - Japanese regional banks will likely struggle to restore profitability to pre-pandemic levels due to a subdued economic recovery and ultralow interest rates, Moody's says. About half of the country's listed regional banks reported drops in net income or net losses for the fiscal year ended March, the ratings company says. The average nonperforming loan ratio of 12 rated regional banks rose 15 basis points as of the end of March from a year earlier, Moody's says, adding it expects NPL ratios to rise further and loan loss provisions to stay elevated because default rates among businesses will rise amid a weak recovery. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka) \n\n  0927 GMT - Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' indexes show a picture of robust operating conditions midway through the second quarter, Claus Vistesen, senior eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says. \"Output growth slowed slightly, but remains robust overall, and the near-term outlook is positive due to brisk growth in sales and new orders,\" the economist says. However, the supply side is not that positive. Firms' purchasing activity is now at a record high and delivery times have soared in response, he says. \"Not surprisingly, input price inflation is rising sharply, forcing firms to respond in kind, by raising output charges,\" Vistesen says. On the positive side, employment seems to be in a solid uptrend and the outlook for the next 12 months is brightening, he says. (maria.martinez@wsj.com) \n\n  0923 GMT - The index of German blue-chip companies - the DAX 30 - currently trading at 15,606, is escaping from a symmetrical triangle pattern in place since May 25th high. Prices are supported by the rising 20/50-simple moving averages on a 60-minute chart. Bollinger are widening, indicating that a new up leg may be on the cards. As long as 15,350 (May 27th low) is support, the bias remains bullish. Expect a further rise towards 15,671 and 15,730 in extension. Alternatively, a push below 15,350 would call for a reversal down trend with 15,100 as main target.

Key U.S. data this week include the ISM manufacturing report at 1400 GMT on Tuesday, the ISM non-manufacturing report, ADP private payrolls and weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday, and the nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. The DXY dollar index falls 0.3% to 89.8060. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0918 GMT - Around 630,000 foreign tourists visited Spain in April, more than the 490,000 registered in March but far from the 7.15 million visitors who entered the country in April 2019, data from the Spanish statistics office INE show. No travellers came to Spain in April 2020, when the pandemic-induced lockdown prompted the closure of international borders. Spain will let vaccinated tourists from anywhere in the world enter the country from June 7 in an attempt to speed up the sector's recovery this summer. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) \n\n  0915 GMT - Hyve Group has confirmed that it is considering funding options to accelerate its post-pandemic growth and capitalize on market disruption, which indicates that there is scope for further market consolidation, Citi says. The events industry continues to be an extremely fragmented sector, Citi says. Moreover, the statement from U.K. events group Hyve is confirmation that the industry is of de facto interest for private-equity investors, the bank says. \"Putting this together, we think this is an encouraging development and underpins our positive view on the [events] subsector and in particular our Buys not only on Hyve but also RELX and Informa,\" Citi says.

In a bid to build U.S. brand awareness, the Italian-based company plans to add about a dozen Illy Caff\u00e8s and shops this year to its 20 already in service in the U.S. \n\n  There are just a few problems-including American taste in coffee. Most consumers in the U.S. favor giant, sweetened coffee drinks, rather than Illy's signature small cups of espresso. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Israel Gets New Government to End Netanyahu's 12-Year Rule \n\n  TEL AVIV-A new Israeli coalition government led by commando-turned-tech entrepreneur Naftali Bennett ended Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year run in power, but now faces the difficult tasks of reviving an economy battered by the Covid-19 pandemic and preserving a fragile cease-fire with Palestinian militant group Hamas. \n\n  Mr. Bennett of the right-wing Yamina party took over as prime minister Sunday after his new, wide-ranging coalition was backed by 60 lawmakers in the 120-member Knesset, ending months of stalemate. Fifty-nine lawmakers voted against his coalition and one abstained. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Ousted From Power, Israel's Netanyahu Plots Comeback \n\n  TEL AVIV-Outmaneuvered by rival politicians after 12 years in power, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already plotting a comeback, intending to challenge the new government on matters that could deeply divide the cross-party coalition. \n\n  Mr. Netanyahu, who now is expected to lead the opposition, plans to press the new governing coalition, which includes eight parties ranging from an Arab group to conservative forces, on sensitive policy issues such as settlement construction and empowering the country's Arabs. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Biden and Macron Share Affection and Worldview at G-7 Summit \n\n  President Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron threw their arms around each other as they walked on the beach. Later the two men shared a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate as aides looked on. At one point Mr. Biden asked Mr. Macron to answer a reporter's question for him. \n\n  At the summit of the Group of Seven leaders in Cornwall this weekend, the two presidents embraced each other, sometimes literally, as allies on a host of issues-from multilateralism to fighting climate change-after years of volatility between Mr. Macron and former President Donald Trump. \n\n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n\n  GLOBAL NEWS \n\n  Investors Bet Green-Energy Focus Will Push Up Oil Prices \n\n  Some investors are wagering that Wall Street's preference for green energy will depress spending on oil extraction, setting the stage for supply shortages and higher fuel prices. \n\n  The bets come as money managers line up trillions of dollars for wind, solar and other renewable programs and expenditures on oil projects tumble. The drop in fossil-fuel spending is becoming so severe that energy companies could struggle to quench the world's thirst for oil, some analysts say. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Fed Officials Could Pencil In Earlier Rate Increase at Meeting \n\n  WASHINGTON-Federal Reserve officials could signal this week that they anticipate raising interest rates sooner than previously expected following a spate of high inflation readings. \n\n  In March, the last time they released quarterly economic forecasts, most officials expected to keep the Fed's benchmark interest rate near zero through 2023 to encourage the economy's recovery from the pandemic. Officials are set to release updated projections Wednesday after a two-day policy meeting. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  G-7 Leaders Rally to Biden's Call to Challenge China \n\n  CARBIS BAY, England-Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies called on China to respect human rights but stopped short of an outright condemnation of Beijing, as President Biden sought to build momentum for an international coalition to counter Chinese influence in the world. \n\n  A 25-page joint statement released by leaders of the G-7 nations on Sunday-covering issues ranging from pandemic recovery to the global economy, tax, trade and girls' education-asked China \"to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.\" The same section of the statement said the G-7 would continue to consult on how to challenge China's behavior in the global economy. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Economy Week Ahead: The Fed, Factories and Consumers \n\n  The Federal Reserve's policy meeting highlights this week's slate of economic news. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Markets Are Leaving Little Room for the Fed to Be Wrong on Inflation \n\n  Investors have faith in the Fed. Over the past three months consumer prices, excluding volatile food and energy, have risen 2%, equivalent to a shockingly high annual rate of 8.2%. Rather than panic and dump bonds, investors have piled into Treasurys and pushed 10-year yields back down to where they stood in late February. Confidence in the central bank is absolute. \n\n  To be fair, the Fed is probably right: This burst of inflation is probably transitory. The reopening of the economy released a surge of pent-up demand, while supply bottlenecks are restricting production and distribution. As things get back to normal inflation should calm down. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Regulators Tell Banks It Is Time to Stop Using Libor \n\n  Regulators are ramping up efforts to end Libor trades by year-end. \n\n  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week told brokers that facilitate derivatives trading among large banks that they should stop using Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, as a reference rate by July 26. The Tuesday announcement could accelerate the push to phase out the troubled interest-rate benchmark, which underpins trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts. Authorities decided several years ago, after a widespread Libor-rigging scandal, that it should disappear by the end of 2021. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.S. Fight Against Chinese 5G Efforts Shifts From Threats to Incentives \n\n  The U.S. government is ratcheting up pressure on Beijing's 5G ambitions overseas, offering financial incentives and other enticements to countries willing to shun Chinese-made telecom gear. \n\n  U.S. foreign-affairs agencies are developing workshops and a handbook that would help policy makers in places like Central and Eastern Europe, and in developing countries elsewhere, to build next-generation 5G cellular networks that don't use equipment from Huawei Technologies Co. and China's ZTE Corp. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Write to sarka.halas@wsj.com \n\n  Write to us at newsletters@dowjones.com \n\n  We offer an enhanced version of this briefing that is optimized for viewing on mobile devices and sent directly to your email inbox.

Annual CPI Decelerates to 3.1% in June -- Update\n\n  By Kim Mackrael \n\n  OTTAWA--Canada's annual inflation rate decelerated in June as the effects of last year's economic reopening contributed to smaller year-over-year price increases compared with prior months. \n\n  Canada's consumer-price index rose 3.1% on a year-over-year basis in June, Statistics Canada said Wednesday, slower than the 3.6% increase recorded in the previous month. Market expectations were for a 3.2% rise in June, according to economists at TD Securities. \n\n  On a month-over-month basis, prices climbed 0.3% in June. On a seasonally adjusted basis, CPI rose 0.1% in June from the previous month. \n\n  Excluding gasoline, headline inflation rose by 2.2% on an annual basis in June, the data agency said. \n\n  Meanwhile, the average of the Bank of Canada's preferred measures for underlying inflation in June was 2.23%. Core inflation is meant to gauge price changes in items that exclude volatile goods like food and energy. \n\n  Several economists said the June deceleration should ease concerns about the possibility of a persistent rise in headline inflation. The Bank of Canada said earlier this month that the factors pushing up inflation are largely temporary, such as a rebound in gasoline prices and supply-chain bottlenecks. Officials at the central bank expect inflation to remain above 3% through the second half of 2021 before easing back toward 2% in 2022. \n\n  \"While the headline rate is still well above the Bank of Canada's 2% target, the deceleration appears to confirm the central bank's view that much of the recent pickup in inflation was transitory,\" CIBC Capital Markets economist Royce Mendes said. \n\n  The June data used Statistics Canada's recently revised weights in calculating the consumer-price index, reflecting changes in spending patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic by putting more weight on shelter and household furnishings, and less on transportation. The data agency said the headline number for annual inflation wasn't affected by the new weightings. \n\n  Statistics Canada said the deceleration in June was largely the result of price increases that took place one year earlier, at a time when the economy was reopening after the initial shutdown that began in March 2020 and was meant to curb the spread of Covid-19. Annual inflation data compare current prices with those from a year earlier. \n\n  In June, shelter prices rose 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and transportation prices increased 5.6%. Price growth slowed the most in the clothing and footwear category, advancing just 1.1% year-over-year, mainly because of lower prices for women's clothing. Gasoline prices also advanced at a slower annual pace in June compared with the previous month. \n\n  Write to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 28, 2021 09:50 ET (13:50 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.898685Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T23:05:03.311818Z", "inner_id": 74, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7707, "annotations": [{"id": 6845, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 280, "end": 286, "text": "supply", "labels": ["Supply (residual)"]}, "id": "801305", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 311, "end": 317, "text": "demand", "labels": ["Demand (residual)"]}, "id": "364557", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 688, "end": 697, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "189141", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1640, "end": 1649, "text": "Shortages", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "276253", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1679, "end": 1685, "text": "demand", "labels": ["Demand (residual)"]}, "id": "418274", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1699, "end": 1711, "text": "inflationary", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "540651", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 2769, "end": 2778, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "393103", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3077, "end": 3099, "text": "Constrained production", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "256156", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3439, "end": 3452, "text": "chip shortage", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "311777", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3705, "end": 3708, "text": "Buy", "labels": ["Price-Gouging"]}, "id": "385987", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3833, "end": 3846, "text": "chip shortage", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "647021", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 524, "end": 533, "text": "The spike", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "Owh4Jq1Z_W", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"start": 2686, "end": 2707, "text": "Low new- and used-car", "labels": ["Transportation Costs"]}, "id": "d5wna4ALCD", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "Owh4Jq1Z_W", "to_id": "189141", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}, {"from_id": "d5wna4ALCD", "to_id": "393103", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-27T23:22:03.800059Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T23:22:03.800085Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-27T23:18:50.896280Z", "lead_time": 1005.885, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 14, "unique_id": "2b299b3e-fcd6-4027-a36b-6d3c6ee70acd", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7707, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2134, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2134], "data": {"inner_id": 401, "text": "The Chip Shortage Looks Like the Oil Shortage of the 1970s. What It Means for Stocks and the Economy. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Al Root \n\n     Semiconductors might be the new oil -- and that could make the 2020s the new 1970s. \n\n     Back then, the world ran on oil -- and any change in supply had a massive impact on demand. When OPEC embargoed the U.S. in the 1970s, the price of crude rose from about $3 a barrel at the beginning of the decade to $13 a barrel by its end. The U.S. even issued gas ration coupons in 1974. \n\n     The spike was good news for Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which returned roughly 100% and 70%, respectively, in the 1970s, but painful for everyone else, as inflation raged. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 17% and 5%, respectively, over the decade. \n\n     If oil was the necessary component for the 1970s economy, chips provide the same function in the 2020s. They power everything from our computers and phones to our cars and appliances. And, as everyone knows by now, there is a shortage, with delivery times growing to more than 20 weeks, per Susquehanna Financial Group data. \n\n     Roughly 80% of all the chips in the world are made in Northeast Asia. Politicians realize how big a problem this is, and they have started to demand local manufacturing, with President Joe Biden introducing a plan for $50 billion in chip research earlier this year. Reshoring any industry, including semiconductors, is a yearslong process that requires billions in capital. There will be winners and losers. And if it goes on too long, it will filter into the prices of all kinds of goods. \n\n     \"Shortages related to rapid upswings in demand could become inflationary, \" TS Lombard's Rory Green and Steven Blitz wrote back in January, when the scarcity of chips -- \"a product more known for steadily declining prices\" -- was in its infancy. \n\n     The global semiconductor shortage has been a particular thorn in the side of the automotive industry all year. It was supposed to resolve itself by the second half of 2021. But more production cuts announced by Toyota Motor (TM) this past week shows the problem isn't going away soon. In fact, RBC analyst Joseph Spak argues the shortage could last for years. \n\n     Part of the problem is structural, Spak says. Electric vehicles need more computing power, but the auto industry typically relies on older-generation chip technology, where capacity isn't being as readily added by chip makers. Instead, they prefer to focus on newer, higher-end chips for the consumer electronics industry. \n\n     The result: Instead of lines at the gas stations, there are lines at the automotive dealerships. Low new- and used-car inventories have pushed up pricing and contributed to rising inflation. Used-car prices rose about 20% in the first half of 2021, while new-car prices rose about 3%. The rise in used-car prices has started to slow, but new-car price gains are accelerating, rising about 7% year over year in July. \n\n     That's not good for consumers, but auto makers stand to benefit. Constrained production will lead to persistently low inventories and higher pricing. Companies will sell fewer cars, but that's been offset by higher prices. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) shares are up 43% and 17%, respectively, in 2021, and both still trade for about seven times 2022 earnings. \n\n     And that's just the auto industry. The longer the chip shortage goes on, the more prices will rise in all types of products. That will benefit chip makers such as Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Wall Street sees upside in the latter. Some two-thirds of analysts covering the stock rate it Buy, and the average price target implies about a 33% upside. \n\n     Don't expect long lines outside RadioShack, but expect the chip shortage to be felt just the same. \n\n     Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  August 20, 2021 21:18 ET (01:18 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.898769Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T23:22:04.022655Z", "inner_id": 75, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7708, "annotations": [{"id": 6846, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 333, "end": 345, "text": "unemployment", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "169548", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 400, "end": 412, "text": "natural rate", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "249281", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 584, "end": 594, "text": "employment", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "158970", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 805, "end": 815, "text": "employment", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "144098", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1333, "end": 1342, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "513261", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1349, "end": 1355, "text": "target", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "316415", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1360, "end": 1366, "text": "policy", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "779748", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1385, "end": 1398, "text": "long-run rate", "labels": ["Inflation Expectations"]}, "id": "829645", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3688, "end": 3710, "text": "interest rate increase", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "598758", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3787, "end": 3802, "text": "asset purchases", "labels": ["Government Spending"]}, "id": "754752", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 3826, "end": 3844, "text": "supply constraints", "labels": ["Supply (residual)"]}, "id": "292681", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4583, "end": 4598, "text": "asset purchases", "labels": ["Government Spending"]}, "id": "936301", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 6891, "end": 6903, "text": "unemployment", "labels": ["Labor Shortage"]}, "id": "704975", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1789, "end": 1808, "text": "inflation forecasts", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "MkevKzbiRa", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"start": 2000, "end": 2011, "text": "bottlenecks", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "t1bfWOrcrL", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"value": {"start": 2016, "end": 2025, "text": "shortages", "labels": ["Supply (residual)"]}, "id": "o6JWJAx3YW", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "t1bfWOrcrL", "to_id": "MkevKzbiRa", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}, {"from_id": "o6JWJAx3YW", "to_id": "MkevKzbiRa", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-27T23:27:58.501152Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T23:27:58.501184Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-27T23:23:56.084058Z", "lead_time": 351.957, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 17, "unique_id": "f68cad6a-f990-4d15-ae00-4afc87231031", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7708, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2135, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2135], "data": {"inner_id": 402, "text": "Transcript: Fed Chief Powell&apos;s Postmeeting Press -2-\n\n     So the question is really on the maximum-employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate, 50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress. Many on the committee feel that the substantial further progress test for employment has been met. Others feel that it's close. They want to see a little more progress. There's a range of perspectives. \n\n     I guess my own view would be that the test, the substantial further progress test for employment, is all but met. And so once we've met those two tests, once the committee decides that they've met, and that could come as soon as the next meeting -- that's the purpose of that language is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting -- the committee will consider that test and we'll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper. \n\n     Q: Thanks, Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. \n\n     So looking at the steps, we have now, basically, four years of inflation above target and policy never gets to the long-run rate. I'm wondering if you could address that from two perspectives, one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year, and second, from the perspective of the average household that's now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when for some this year real wages have actually gone down. \n\n     MR. POWELL: Sure. So as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the out years and that's really, I think, a reflection of -- and they've moved up significantly for this year -- and that's, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being -- that we're seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. \n\n     So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation is going to be higher this year and a number -- you know, I guess, the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up but just by a couple of tenths. \n\n     Those are very modest overshoots. You're looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years -- two years and three years out. These are very, very -- I don't think that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot. That just happens to be people's forecasts. You know, we want to -- we want to foster a strong labor market and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we're very much on track to achieve those things. \n\n     In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want and we're -- that's really the ultimate test of whether we're getting this done under the framework and, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent. I wouldn't put -- I wouldn't put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and '24 -- one-tenth in '24. But you're right, those are the numbers. \n\n     Q: Chair Powell -- thank you, Michelle. \n\n     Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I'm wondering what the contours of that debate have been. For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase? Or is it about financial stability risks or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? \n\n     Thank you. \n\n     MR. POWELL: So let me say that there's very broad support on the committee for this plan both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote today, and I'd say quite, quite broad support for this approach. You're correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner and they've made their arguments publicly. For some of them, it's a financial stability concern and for others it's other concerns. They can make their own -- make their own arguments. \n\n     This is -- this is an approach that the committee will, broadly, support and it will -- it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate. You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the -- in the early stages of the crisis, they were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets. \n\n     Then as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do, and now we're in a situation where they still have a use but it's time for us to begin to taper them. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework -- the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go and, again, broad support on the committee. \n\n     Q: Hi, Nick Timiraos of The Wall Street Journal. \n\n     Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just to taper, may be closer at hand. Does the committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you've articulated, or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do? \n\n     MR. POWELL: Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper, and the taper takes some months in everyone's figuring, so you're going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it is -- it's what we adopted last September. It's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, and while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market's very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market and we think that those imbalances will sort themselves out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve moderately higher inflation, over 2 percent -- you know, that really depends on the path of inflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff. \n\n     So I just think -- if you look at what people are writing down for year and 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates, and that's only one indicator but it suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they're writing down, in good faith, what they see as meeting the test. There's a range of perspectives about where the economy will be. But, by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023, so it's not really an unusually wide array of views about this. \n\n     Q: Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year, and I wonder if you thought those were appropriate. \n\n     MR. POWELL: So no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. \n\n     So let me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission, and that's why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business. One of those is -- sort of three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictions: one is ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that's bank securities and other things; secondly, there are times when we're not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets, and that's the period immediately before or during an FOMC meeting; and third, there's regular disclosure. \n\n     So all of these -- everyone's, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis, so, you know, I would have to go back and read people's financial disclosures to know what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you'd say it's served us well. The other thing you would say -- that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public's trust in us. We need to make changes and we're going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review. We're going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards. \n\n     Q: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \n\n     I want to follow up on Jeanna's question. The issue of ownership of these stocks and trades, do you think it's appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying? Is that one of the modifications that you're looking at? And in that these -- you said yourself they're clearly not seen as appropriate. In that the Fed's code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of conflict, do those trades, in fact, and holdings violate the Fed's code of conduct? Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might be done with your review? Thank you, sir. \n\n     MR. POWELL: Don't have a timeline yet. We can start with that. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  September 22, 2021 16:56 ET (20:56 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.898877Z", "updated_at":

and rising inflation as consumers head into the holiday shopping season. \n\n     Sales at retail stores, restaurants and online sellers rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. The rise in sales reflects persistently strong demand and higher consumer prices. \n\n     Consumers, armed with stimulus payments and rising wages, have stepped up spending this year, shrugging off the Delta variant of Covid-19, the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and emerging supply constraints. The retail sales, which aren't adjusted for inflation, rose 13.9% in September from a year earlier. Consumer inflation increased 5.4% in that time, according to the Labor Department. \n\n     Still, economists see some reasons for concern in the months ahead, including supply chain disruptions causing backlogs and pushing up prices further, a slowing labor market recovery and anxious consumers. \n\n     \"The shipping bottlenecks will become more of an issue in November and December when you have that spike in holiday-related sales,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief economist at Jefferies LLC. \n\n     So far, consumers have proven resilient. Retail spending in the first week of October was up 8.8% compared with the average week in September, according to data from Earnest Research, which tracks credit- and debit-card purchases. \n\n     Barclays PLC economists see consumer spending -- both in goods and services -- rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3% in the fourth quarter from the third. The bank sees a 1.3% growth rate in the third quarter. \n\n     \"There should be some momentum going into the holiday season,\" said Pooja Sriram, a U.S. economist at Barclays. \n\n     Several rounds of government stimulus have left households sitting on roughly $1.6 trillion in savings, representing 9.4% of their disposable income, well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Commerce Department. Private-sector hourly wages were up 4.6% in September over the previous year, according to the Labor Department. \n\n     Friday's report led IHS Markit to raise its economic growth forecasts to 1.6% from 1.4% for the third quarter and to 5.4% from 5.1% for the fourth quarter. \n\n     Increased spending in September contrasted with shoppers' view of the economy dimming. An index of consumer sentiment fell in October to 71.4 from 72.8 in September, the University of Michigan reported Friday. Americans worried about rising prices, product shortages, the labor market, the Delta variant and the ongoing debate on Capitol Hill over infrastructure and social spending, said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. \n\n     Meanwhile, the backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing. Dozens of ships remain anchored off the coast, waiting to be unloaded at U.S. ports. Containers are piled up in warehouses waiting to be shipped and trucking companies can't find enough drivers. \n\n     On Wednesday, the Biden administration said the Port of Los Angeles -- one of the country's busiest -- would operate 24 hours a day in an attempt to clear the backlog. \n\n     IKEA, the world's largest furniture retailer, said Thursday shipping backlogs were making it difficult to get products from warehouses to stores. Still, the company reported higher revenues as customers moved to online sales. \n\n     Business inventories rose 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said separately Friday. The ratio of inventories to sales, which measures how much is in stock relative to sales, rose slightly but remains well below prepandemic levels. \n\n     James Burris, owner of Black Dog Bikes in Staunton, Va., regularly tells customers looking for a specific item that he can't get it shipped to the store right away because of supply-chain problems. \n\n     \"Not being able to suddenly order one of those higher-end bikes has hurt because we're missing out on the sale,\" he said. The store has a supply of entry-level bikes, he added, and sales overall have been on par with 2019. \n\n     September spending on autos and auto parts rose 0.5% last month even though auto unit sales fell in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.6 million from a recent peak of 18.8 million in April, according to a separate Commerce Department report. \n\n     Economists said the discrepancy was caused by higher prices and manufacturers' greater focus on luxury vehicles.The sector has been hit hard by a global shortage in computer chips, leaving dealers with few cars on their lots. \n\n     Spending at restaurants and bars was up 0.3% in September. Consumers also spent 1.8% more at gas stations, and 3.7% more at sporting goods, music and book stores. \n\n     A delayed back-to-school shopping season may have boosted September's number. Some parents held off on purchases in the summer while waiting for schools to clarify plans, said Ms. Markowska, the Jefferies economist. \n\n     Zach Gray, manager of Music & Arts, a music store in Greenville S.C., said many are buying instruments this year, rather than renting, suggesting consumers have money to spend. \"It's not quite normal for a parent to drop $700 on a saxophone for their sixth-grader who's unsure they want to continue with it,\" he said. \n\n     --Gwynn Guilford contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow

preliminary data released by the German statistics office Destatis on Thursday. \n\n  Consumer prices rose 4.5% on year measured by national standards, above the forecast of 4.4% of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. They rose 4.6% on year by European Union-harmonized standards, above the forecast of 4.5%. \n\n  The increase in the inflation rate is caused mainly by base effects due to lower prices in 2020, the statistics office said. In this context, the temporary value added tax reduction and the sharp decline in mineral-oil-product prices also had an upward effect on the overall inflation rate, Destatis said. \n\n  Additional factors were the introduction of carbon-dioxide pricing in January 2021 and pandemic-related effects, such as marked price increases during the stage of economic recovery, the statistics office said. \n\n  Consumer prices rose 0.5% on month by national standards, in line with the forecast of economists polled by the Journal.

Higher wages, including an average 15% increase this year at company-owned U.S. restaurants, is helping, but not as much as anticipated, executives said. \n\n     \"Certainly I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized,\" chief executive Chris Kempczinski told investors Wednesday. \n\n     The Big Mac maker is also paying more for paper, food and other supplies, executives said. McDonald's expects its commodity costs for the year to rise by 3.5% to 4%, up from the 2% they grew earlier in 2021, executives said. \n\n     Those higher costs are making their way to consumers, as McDonald's executives said they expect U.S. prices to be up about 6% this year compared to last year. \n\n     Companies across the globe are raising consumer prices in response to growing costs spanning distribution and freight to fuel and food. U.S. inflation in September remained at its highest rate in more than a decade, Labor Department data showed. \n\n     Many restaurants are raising menu prices to offset higher wages for cooks and servers and rising costs for meat, packaging, vegetable oil and other commodities. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., Del Taco Restaurants Inc. and Chili's owner Brinker International Inc. are among the chains that told investors in recent weeks that they have increased prices to help cover costs. \n\n     McDonald's said Wednesday that global same-store sales in the quarter ended Sept. 30 increased 10.2% compared with the same period before the pandemic. U.S. same-store sales were up 14.6% compared with the equivalent 2019 period. \n\n     McDonald's said that bigger order sizes and higher prices increased its revenue in the U.S., as did its new crispy chicken sandwich and celebrity-endorsed meals. Diners are placing more to-go orders and buying for larger groups than prior to the pandemic, contributing to higher sales per customer, executives said. \n\n     \"We are still selling more sandwiches, we're still selling more fries,\" Mr. Kempczinski said. \n\n     McDonald's reported quarterly net income climbed 22% from the same quarter a year earlier, rising to $2.15 billion. Sales totaling $6.2 billion increased 14% from the previous year's period. Adjusting for one-time items, McDonald's said it earned $2.76 a share. \n\n     The company's sales and earnings topped analysts' expectations. McDonald's shares rose 2.2% to $241.57 in morning trading. \n\n     McDonald's slightly increased its projected sales across its restaurants for 2021. It also anticipates opening more restaurants globally, mainly in China and other international markets. In the U.S., supply-chain backlogs for kitchen equipment and permitting delays are postponing some new restaurant openings until next year, the company said. \n\n     McDonald's, the world's biggest burger chain, said that it had fewer Covid-19-related restaurant closures over the past quarter in major markets such as Canada, France and Germany, helping McDonald's sales in those countries. Still, vaccine health pass requirements in France and quarantine orders in Australia, for example, made operations more challenging, the company said. \n\n     In the U.S., roughly 3,000 McDonald's dining rooms remain closed in areas with high Covid-19 infection rates, or roughly 20% of locations. U.S. sales remain elevated at drive-throughs, online and through delivery, even after reopening a location's dining room, executives said. \n\n     McDonald's acquired a string of technology startups prior to the pandemic to develop systems such as voice-recognition ordering at drive-throughs. The company said Wednesday it was selling a technology lab it developed in the Bay Area to International Business Machines Corp. to better advance that work. \n\n     Write to Heather Haddon at

{"inner_id": 411, "text": "Asian Morning Briefing: U.S. Stocks Post Biggest Weekly Gains in Months\n\n  MARKET SNAPSHOT \n\n  U.S. stocks finished their best week in months after strong earnings reports. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.572%, up from 1.519% on Thursday. The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.07% to 88.36. U.S. oil futures finished higher, with prices up an eighth straight week. Gold futures ended lower, but prices logged their strongest weekly gain since early September. \n\n  MARKET WRAPS \n\n  EQUITIES \n\n  U.S. stocks rose, notching their biggest weekly gains in months following a strong streak of earnings reports. \n\n  The S&P 500 added 0.75% after rallying in its biggest one-day advance since March on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.5%. For the week, the S&P 500 was up 1.8%, its best showing since July. Solid quarterly results from healthcare companies and banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have buoyed the market in recent days. Economic data have also helped reassure investors about the growth outlook. \n\n  Japanese stocks ended broadly higher, led by especially strong gains in electronics stocks, as the yen fell to its lowest level in nearly three years and amid continued hopes for economic reopening. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.8%, its highest level since November 2018. \n\n  Chinese stocks ended the session higher with coal and renewable-energy companies rising. Renewable-energy companies are facing tailwinds from continued policy support as China seeks to decarbonize. Coal producers, on the other hand, are likely benefiting from high coal prices as the country faces an energy crunch. The Shanghai Composite Index ended 0.4% higher, the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 0.1%, while the ChiNext Price Index rose 1.9% to 3276.32. \n\n  Elsewhere, New Zealand's NZX-50 closed 0.3% lower, after company-specific trades prevented the index from coattailing on Wall Street's rise. Mainfreight declined 2.3% and lost 6.0% this week as shipping companies that have benefited from the pandemic gave back some of their strong gains. The index fell 0.6% for the week and is down 2.0% this month. \n\n  And Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index closed 0.7% higher, overcoming a midsession wobble amid gains by travel and mining stocks. Qantas, Corporate Travel Management, Flight Centre and Webjet added between 2.0% and 4.05% after Australia's most-populous state said it would no longer quarantine fully vaccinated international arrivals from next month. The ASX 200 finished 0.6% higher for the week. \n\n  COMMODITIES \n\n  Oil futures extended their rise to multiyear highs, with U.S. and global benchmark crude scoring an eighth weekly gain in a row - the longest such streak of gains for a front-month Brent contract in more than two decades. \n\n  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery rose 1.2% to settle at $82.28 a barrel, with front-month prices marking their highest finish since Oct. 21, 2014, according to Dow Jones Market Data. December Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose 1% to $84.86 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe after hitting a session high above $85. Prices ended the session at their highest since Oct. 9, 2018. \n\n  Gold futures ended lower, as strength in Treasury yields and the U.S. stock market help lead prices to their first loss in four sessions. But the precious metal still notched its best weekly advance in six weeks. \n\n  December gold fell nearly 1.7% to settle at $1,768.30 an ounce on Comex, after picking up 0.2% on Thursday and settling at the highest since Sept. 14, FactSet data show. For the week, gold gained 0.6%, which marked its steepest weekly climb since the week ended Sept. 3. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES \n\n  Retail Sales Rise, Showing Strong Consumer Demand, Higher Inflation \n\n  Americans stepped up their spending in September, a sign of resilient demand and rising inflation as consumers head into the holiday shopping season. \n\n  Sales at retail stores, restaurants and online sellers rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday. The rise in sales reflects persistently strong demand and higher consumer prices. \n\n  Consumers, armed with stimulus payments and rising wages, have stepped up spending this year, shrugging off the Delta variant of Covid-19, the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and emerging supply constraints. The retail sales, which aren't adjusted for inflation, rose 13.9% in September from a year earlier. Consumer inflation increased 5.4% in that time, according to the Labor Department. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  U.S. Consumer Sentiment Decreased in Early October -University of Michigan \n\n  Consumer sentiment in the U.S. fell slightly in early October as the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant and supply-chain strains weighed on Americans' mood. \n\n  The preliminary estimate of the index of consumer sentiment released Friday by the University of Michigan decreased to 71.4 in October from 72.8 in September. The reading missed estimates from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, who expected the indicator to come in at 73.0. \n\n  \"The Delta variant, supply-chain shortages, and reduced labor-force-participation rates will continue to dim the pace of consumer spending into 2022,\" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  J&J Covid-19 Booster Shot Endorsed by FDA Advisers \n\n  Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously Friday to recommend the agency authorize an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine, to shore up protection against the coronavirus. \n\n  The panel of outside doctors and experts voted 19-0 to recommend that all adults who received a first dose of the J&J vaccine should get the second dose at least two months later. \n\n  The FDA could decide on whether to clear a J&J booster within days. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Goldman Sachs Profit Rises on Deal Bonanza \n\n  Companies are ravenous for deals. Wall Street investment bankers are feasting on big paydays. \n\n  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Friday reported a 60% jump in profit and a 26% increase in revenue, beating analysts' expectations. The Wall Street titan rounded out earnings season for the biggest U.S. banks, all of which reported double-digit profit gains. \n\n  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. released some of the money they had set aside to deal with pandemic losses, a sign of their confidence in the bumpy economic recovery. \n\n   \n \n \n\n  Nissan Motor Ordered to Pay $353.9 Million to Middle East Company \n\n  Nissan Motor Co. was ordered by a Dubai court to pay 1.3 billion Emirati dirham ($353.9 million) to Middle East company Al Dahana FZCO, which sought damages over a distribution agreement. \n\n  Al Dahana said the Dubai Court of First Instance issued its judgment in September. In the case, which was first filed in 2019, Al Dahana said it was seeking compensation for damages suffered due to breach of contract by Nissan. \n\n  A Nissan spokesman said the company had fully complied with its contractual obligations and that it was appealing the decision. \n\n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n\n  Expected Major Events for Monday \n\n  00:30/SIN: Sep Merchandise Trade, incl non-oil domestic exports (NODX) \n\n  02:00/CHN: Sep Retail sales \n\n  02:00/CHN: Sep Fixed Assets Investment \n\n  02:00/CHN: Sep Industrial Output \n\n  02:00/CHN: 3Q GDP \n\n  08:30/HK: Aug External Merchandise Trade: Volume & Price Statistics \n\n  09:59/CHN: Sep FDI Foreign Direct Investment \n\n  All times in GMT.

President Biden's decision to nominate Lael Brainard to become Federal Reserve vice chairwoman elevates a veteran policy maker and economist who has been a strong ally of Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank's boldest policy decisions during the pandemic. \n\n     Ms. Brainard was a key adviser to Mr. Powell as the Fed scaled up emergency-lending backstops last year, and she provided influential intellectual support for his effort last year to revamp the Fed's policy-setting framework. Under the new framework, the Fed set aside its practice of raising rates to pre-empt inflationary pressures and pledged to keep interest rates low to foster a faster and broader labor-market recovery. \n\n     Ms. Brainard has been especially outspoken about avoiding the mistakes of raising interest rates prematurely after a downturn when interest rates are near zero. \n\n     Mr. Biden on Monday also said he would nominate Mr. Powell to a second term as Fed chairman. Now, both leaders face perhaps their trickiest policy challenge of the past four years: A bout of inflation that is proving to be more stubborn than anyone at the central bank anticipated is raising questions over how the Fed should set policy in the months ahead. \n\n     Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have underscored the importance of not raising rates until labor markets are tight to build up the credibility of their new framework this year. But with inflation running well above the Fed's 2% target, they are facing questions over how long they can maintain that stance before eroding the central bank's credibility. \n\n     Brisk demand for goods, disrupted supply chains, temporary shortages and a rebound in travel have pushed 12-month inflation to its highest readings in decades. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.1% in October from a year earlier, according to the Fed's preferred gauge. \n\n     \"We're entering a period of great policy uncertainty. Will they raise rates in the first half of 2022? Are they going to have the resolve to wait? It's going to take a lot of courage,\" said Derek Tang, an economist at LH Meyer Inc., an economic-forecasting firm. \n\n     \"Brainard has been very focused on maintaining maximum employment,\" said Mr. Tang. \"If there's a difference between how Powell and Brainard characterize that threshold, the market could ask, 'Who should we listen to?'\" \n\n     If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Brainard would succeed Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, whose term on the central bank's board expires in January. The Fed's vice chair, along with the New York Fed president, is part of the inner circle of advisers -- known as the troika -- that shape the agenda for monetary-policy deliberations by the Fed's rate-setting committee. \n\n     When the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global dash for dollars that overwhelmed the ability of many markets to function in March 2020, Mr. Powell asked Ms. Brainard to join the group, an arrangement that has continued to the present. \n\n     Before joining the Fed in 2014, Ms. Brainard helped manage President Barack Obama's response to the 2008 financial crisis during four years as the Treasury Department's top financial diplomat, making her one of the few Democrats intimately involved in responding to the last two economic shocks. \n\n     Ms. Brainard served as an adviser to President Bill Clinton on international economics in the late 1990s. She also served as a staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the George H.W. Bush administration. \n\n     Even though Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have been aligned on monetary policy, there are questions over how they will resolve differences on other issues. Since he became chairman in 2018, she has dissented on 23 board votes, often to protest against loosening banking rules imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. \n\n     Among the six sitting Fed governors, Ms. Brainard has spoken the most enthusiastically about the central bank adopting a digital dollar while raising warnings about the risks of unregulated private digital money, including so-called stablecoins that seek to tie the value of their respective offerings to the dollar. \n\n     Ms. Brainard also expressed concern over the dollar losing its dominance in international payments if other central banks, including in China, press ahead with their digital currencies. \n\n     Mr. Powell, on the other hand, told lawmakers this summer he was torn over whether the benefits of issuing a digital dollar outweighed the costs, including potentially disrupting the banking system. \n\n     Ms. Brainard has pulled the Fed her way on some key banking issues, including twice in 2019, both times with crucial backing from Mr. Powell. First, the Fed bucked opposition from big banks when it voted to establish a round-the-clock payment system for banks to exchange money, a proposal she spearheaded. \n\n     Later, the Fed opted against joining two other federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., on a proposal to overhaul rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 law designed to end racial lending disparities. After Mr. Biden's election, the OCC scrapped its proposed overhaul. \n\n     Ms. Brainard \"almost single-handedly saved the Community Reinvestment Act and managed to get four Republican governors to vote for her outline, \" said Jesse Van Tol, chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. \n\n     Financial-industry officials welcomed both of Mr. Biden's Fed nominations. \"We expect regulators will continue to hold the largest banks to the high regulatory and supervisory standards that have remained in place to support a resilient and essential part of the U.S. financial system,\" said Kevin Fromer, chief executive officer of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest U.S. banks. \n\n     Ms. Brainard received 61 votes during her confirmation in 2014, including from four Republicans who are still in the Senate. \n\n     The daughter of an American diplomat, Ms. Brainard grew up on both sides of the Iron Curtain in Germany and Poland during the Cold War. She has credited that upbringing with fostering her interest in economics. \"I was fascinated by how two countries so close in geography and resources could diverge so sharply simply by being separated by the Iron Curtain,\" she said in a 2014 speech in Claremont, Calif. \n\n     Life in Poland was grim, with an economy that suffocated under a heavy state apparatus, she recalled in a 2017 interview with the college newspaper at Wesleyan University, where she completed her undergraduate degree. The most successful parts of the economy were farming and small-business enterprises that had \"the least amount of red tape and the greatest role for individual initiative,\" she said. \n\n     Ms. Brainard received her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University after a stint working for consulting firm McKinsey & Co. She is married to Kurt Campbell, who is Mr. Biden's point person on Asian affairs on the White House National Security Council. \n\n     Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com \n\n  This

{"inner_id": 413, "text": "U.S. Retail Sales Rose 1.7% in October -- Update\n\nBy Gabriel T. Rubin \n\n     American consumers spent more at the start of the holiday shopping season, brushing off concerns about higher prices at retailers last month. \n\n     Sales at U.S. retail stores, online sellers, and restaurants rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.7% in October compared with the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Consumers continued their stepped-up spending despite continued Covid-19 fears and inflation concerns. \n\n     Spending rose sharply, by 4%, at online retailers, along with big gains at electronics, appliance and hardware stores. Grocery-store sales rose by 1.1% while restaurant and bar sales were flat. Other gains occurred at gas stations, where sales rose 3.9%, and auto dealerships, with a 1.8% gain. \n\n     Walmart Inc. on Tuesday reported higher sales in the third quarter, saying it increased prices as more consumers shopped early for the holidays. The retailer said U.S. inventory rose as it prepare for \"an expected strong holiday season.\" Home Depot Inc., among several retailers reporting earnings this week, said its third-quarter results were better than expected. \n\n     The elevated spending levels suggest solid holiday sales this month and next. Consumers have said they are worried about inflation, which hit a three-decade high last month, but planned to continue spending. \n\n     \"Consumers say they're pessimistic -- we have had very high inflation -- but the truth is they're in very good shape right now,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group. As reasons for the robust demand for goods he cited the roughly $2 trillion in excess savings that households have accrued since the start of the pandemic, as well as low interest rates and an improving labor market. \n\n     Core retail sales, a measurement that excludes spending on autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, were up 1.6%, showing that consumers increased discretionary spending in addition to taking on higher prices for necessary goods. Spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores was up 1.5% and rose by 2.2% at department stores. Pharmacies and clothing stores both saw modest declines from the previous month. \n\n     The combination of strong demand, snarled supply chains, higher prices and an unbalanced labor market is making for an unusual holiday season where record sales may be accompanied by shortages and long waits for goods. Inflation may also start to cut into demand for consumers with lower incomes who may put off purchases due to price increases, economists say. \n\n     Norm Bruce, who with his wife, Eve, owns Martha Merrell's Books and Toys in Waukesha, Wis., said that he expected strong holiday sales. A winter farmers market they set up in front of their Main Street store was a success the first weekend of November, and they plan to continue to use the weekly event to help attract customers. But supply-chain issues and rising prices are taking their toll. \n\n     \"We're telling our customers right now, if you see it, buy it. We don't have 10 or 20 copies of a book right now, we have maybe 1 or 2,\" Mr. Bruce said. \n\n     Most books have prices printed directly on the jacket, preventing Mr. Bruce from charging more. But to keep up with supply pressures, the store has had to raise prices on some other items, giving some customers sticker shock. \n\n     \"All of a sudden, I was having to put increases of $4 or $5 on stuffed animals, because the shipping cost has gone up tremendously,\" Mr. Bruce said. \"Consumers right now are very forgiving, but when the prices start going up, they say, that's a stuffed dog, I don't want to pay that much.\" \n\n     Retail sales figures aren't adjusted for inflation, so some of the increase can be attributed to higher prices. \n\n     The backup in the supply chain shows few signs of easing, as container ships struggle to unload their cargo at U.S. ports. Containers can wait weeks before they are picked up by trucking companies, which say they can't find enough drivers to meet demand. \n\n     The resulting inflation, if left unchecked, could start eating into consumers' budgets enough to tamp down on the elevated demand for goods, Mr. Faucher said. But there are strong incentives for retailers to get their supply chains sorted out. \n\n     \"If you can find out how to get your product to consumers when they're having trouble finding things, you're going to make a lot of money,\" he said. \n\n     Companies attempting to get ahead of the holiday crush may have simply moved it forward by a few weeks, according to a study by Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence. \n\n     Imports are up 20.5% compared with 2019. And individual companies are experiencing longer shipping times for goods, which then prompts them to order goods even earlier ahead of peak shopping times. \n\n     Online shopping has dominated the early days of the holiday retail rush, but that is expected to shift to in-store shopping as the holidays get closer and customers try to avoid shipping delays. And some gift-givers may choose to opt out of material gifts altogether. \n\n     \"Gift card and digital e-gift card sales have also been trending up recently which could continue to be a theme through the holidays,\" said Felipe Chacon, an economist at payments company Square. \n\n     Labor shortages are also contributing to price increases as businesses struggle to meet customer demand. \n\n     Maureen Craig, who owns the Southern Cajun-Creole restaurant Alligator Soul in Savannah, Ga., said that the main thing preventing her from having her best year ever is inability to find enough staff. \n\n     Restaurant and bar sales remained flat between September and October, a sign of weakness in the recovery for an industry that has struggled with a wave of quitting employees, high food prices and persistently high Covid-19 case levels. Restaurants, especially in northern states, are bracing for another winter dependent in part on outdoor dining as some customers remain reluctant to dine indoors. \n\n     \"It's been very, very difficult to hire -- more in the kitchen than in the front of the house,\" Ms. Craig said. She recently decided to close the restaurant on Sundays to alleviate some of the pressure on her chef and kitchen staff. Customers have taken it in stride when she calls them to tell them she has to switch their reservations. \n\n     \"Everyone understands it's an impossible time right now,\" she said. \"I don't want to sacrifice their experience for the almighty dollar.\" \n\n     Write to Gabriel T.

Fears Sped Spending? It Seems So -- Barron&apos;s\n\nBy Lisa Beilfuss \n\n     Inflation is making consumers miserable. To judge from retail sales, that might not matter -- for now. But lofty inflation expectations are a warning worth heeding, potentially signaling slower economic growth ahead. \n\n     When the Commerce Department reported October sales across retail and food-services stores, the results far exceeded expectations, with total sales rising at the fastest pace since March. On the heels of a surprisingly sluggish third-quarter gross-domestic-product report that showed the slowest pace of growth since the recovery began, solid retail sales reminded investors that U.S. consumers are flush, shopping, and still powering economic activity. \n\n     You wouldn't know it, though, to look at confidence surveys. Take the latest report from the University of Michigan. Consumer sentiment fell in early November to its lowest level in a decade, says Richard Curtin, the survey's director. \n\n     The details are even drearier: A quarter of U.S. households expect their financial situation to deteriorate, the biggest share since 2008; half of respondents say the national economy has recently weakened and will continue to do so in the year ahead; and nearly six in 10 consumers think bad times financially will persist in the next five years. Economists at Goldman Sachs say the recent declines in the Michigan gauge would imply a 0.4% drag on fourth-quarter annualized consumption growth, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP. \n\n     What consumers say and what they do don't always jibe. Some economists shun sentiment surveys, viewing them as useless when spending data are readily available each month. After all, the golden rule of behavioral economics is to observe what people pay, not what they say, economist Dan Geller notes. \n\n     But it isn't that simple. Since retail sales are reported in nominal terms, meaning the data aren't inflation-adjusted, it is worth considering the corresponding increase in the consumer price index. That's a back-of-the-envelope way to inflation-adjust the sales figure, says Citi economist Veronica Clark. Applying the CPI roughly suggests that higher prices represented about half of the October increase in sales, with actual sales volume representing the balance. \n\n     Higher prices aren't altogether bad. Companies are successfully passing on climbing wages, rising material prices, and surging shipping costs, protecting profit margins and then padding them some more. Anxious about supply-chain challenges, retailers began pushing out a wave of holiday deals in October, a report from software company Adobe shows. But those deals have been skimpy. Prices rose in 12 of 18 categories last month; they almost always fell, on average, during the same period from 2015 to 2019. \n\n     Expectations for record-high corporate profit margins of 13.1% this year, 13.2% next year, and 13.8% in 2023 are proof that cost pressures aren't squeezing margins, says Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Retailers' stocks are benefiting. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (ticker: XRT) is up 10% this month and 61% this year, far outpacing respective gains of 2% and 25% in the S&P 500 index. Consumers might not be happy about it, but they are paying up. \n\n     At least for now. \"I wouldn't look at it and say, 'All our concerns are gone,' \" notes Citi's Clark of the upside retail sales report. \"Part of it is that prices are pulling forward holiday shopping,\" she adds. \n\n     While solid October sales augur well for fourth-quarter GDP, Clark cautions of possible payback in November and December, with sales in those months potentially lower because consumers shopped earlier. \n\n     Therein lies one reason not to discard survey data that are so glaringly conflicting with reality, or at least the reality before it is adjusted for inflation. Curtin at the University of Michigan attributes falling confidence almost entirely to rising prices. While respondents widely reported nominal income gains, half of all families foresee reduced real incomes next year, and a quarter say they already feel inflation is reducing their standard of living, he says. \n\n     Consumers speeding up purchases in anticipation of higher prices is the very dynamic central bankers fear. If real-world prices shape inflation expectations that wind up determining actual inflation, perception becomes reality. In fact, the report's measure of inflation expectations over the next year edged up to 4.9%, the highest since 2008, with 71% of all consumers surveyed predicting higher prices in the year ahead. \n\n     It's important to note that long-term inflation expectations within the latest Michigan survey held at 2.9% -- elevated, but not alarmingly so. One reading: Consumers buy the narrative that inflation is mostly transitory, believing that rates of prices increase will slow after next year. But not everyone is sold. \n\n     Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, notes that the share of people expecting inflation to be around the Federal Reserve's 2% target over the next year has fallen sharply, and is near the lowest level observed over the past few decades. The number of people predicting inflation of 3% or higher has shot up dramatically, driven by the share of people anticipating inflation of 15% or more. \n\n     Few things are seeing prices rise at that pace. \"But the simple fact that people perceive it that way should be enough to scare the Fed,\" Porcelli says, adding that inflation fear is widespread, with the entire income distribution on the same page. \n\n     The question isn't whether consumers feel inflation and expect it to run higher over the next year. It's whether consumers are spending now because of those rising inflation expectations at the expense of future spending -- or in spite of them. \n\n     Write to Lisa Beilfuss at

Day&apos;s Top News\n\nBy Matt Murray \n\n  Good Morning. In today's edition, small-cap stocks get a boost, inflation means bigger profits for some U.S. businesses, a path to international carbon trading, and Covid-19 cases rise in the North and West. \n\n  Small-cap stocks are getting a boost as investors seek refuge from inflation \n\n  The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks has advanced 5% in November, outpacing the S&P 500 large-cap benchmark's 1.7% gain. Investors are focusing on small companies that they hope can respond quickly to rising inflation. Confidence in the Russell 2000 also tends to reflect positive expectations for the economy, in part because economically sensitive sectors like energy, financials and industrials make up more of the small-cap stock index than of the S&P 500. Investors seeking refuge from inflation have also driven the price of gold up 4.8% this month and sent materials stocks up 5.8% -- putting the group at the lead of the S&P 500's 11 sectors for November. Demand for 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, meanwhile, has dragged yields to record lows. The prospect of negative returns on super safe inflation-protected bonds has pushed investors to buy riskier assets. \n\n  -- In global trading today, Asian stock markets closed mostly higher, Europe was mixed at midday and U.S. stock futures were up. \n\n  -- Mall stocks are back in fashion as shoppers return. \n\n  -- In 2018, uBiome was raising its third round of venture-capital funding, which eventually amounted to $59 million. Just one year later, the company had collapsed. \n\n \n\n  Some companies are raising prices enough to outrun inflation and produce some of their fattest profit margins. After decades of grinding down costs and prices, industries including retail, manufacturing and biotech have seen their profits rise. Other industries, largely those still climbing out of pandemic lockdowns, such as travel, or those too weighted with inflationary costs, have raised prices but haven't experienced a profit boost. \n\n  -- The cost to ship a container across the Pacific fell by more than 25% last week, signaling easing demand for Asian exports. \n\n  -- The Biden administration is stressing its efforts to fight rising costs as high inflation puts its political fortunes at risk. \n\n  -- A decision on who will be next to head the Federal Reserve is expected as soon as this week. \n\n \n\n  Workers ages 25 to 54 are returning at a slower rate, damping expectations for a bigger workforce this fall \n\n  Roughly 1.4 million fewer so-called prime-age workers are working or looking for a job than in the month before the pandemic hit. Factors that were expected to push up job participation this fall, like school reopenings and the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits, aren't as important as previously thought or are taking a long time to boost labor supply. Dwindling savings could drive some workers back; others might settle into a new lifestyle and never return. A slow labor-force recovery could keep propelling wages higher as employers compete for a shrunken pool of workers. Such wage growth could prolong inflationary pressures and force the Fed to raise rates sooner than it otherwise would. \n\n  -- Turnover isn't evenly spread across the U.S. workforce, according to new data on people who have quit. \n\n  -- The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is electing a new president this week. \n\n  -- M.B.A. starting salaries are hitting record highs in a tight labor market. \n\n  -- Malaysia is testing whether its economy can run with fewer foreign workers. \n\n \n\n  Manufacturers struggling with a shortage of chips are finding workarounds -- redesigning products, shipping uncompleted units and focusing on older, lower-tech models. Reworking products has been cumbersome for some companies and challenging for consumers who received products with missing features. Some companies ended up with better products. T3 Motion, which makes electric stand-up vehicles for airport and university security officers, redesigned its vehicle to use a single processor-part of changes that are expected to increase vehicle range. \n\n  In other business news... \n\n  -- Airbus said it can't ramp up production of its A320 single-aisle jet fast enough to meet demand and forecasts delivery constraints for a further three years. \n\n  -- National child-care operators such as KinderCare Education and Bright Horizons Family Solutions are buying up closed centers, aiming to fill a void left by the pandemic. \n\n \n\n  The COP26 summit ended with agreement on long-stalled rules on international carbon trading. Governments from nearly every country endorsed a set of preliminary rules over how governments and companies can create, value and swap credits to drive their net emissions lower in a global trading system. Negotiations over the carbon agreement were overshadowed by a higher-profile deal on emissions cuts and climate-change funding. That broader deal asks its 190-plus signatories next year to revisit emissions-cutting plans that fell short of what scientists say is enough to prevent the worst possible effects of climate change. The deal, though, left big questions about how governments will follow through. \n\n  -- Royal Dutch Shell plans to consolidate its dual-share structure and move its headquarters to London to help it navigate the transition to low-carbon energy. \n\n \n\n  Covid-19 cases are climbing in the upper Midwest, Southwest and parts of the Northeast. Health authorities say the Delta variant is easily finding pockets of unvaccinated people, even in some of the most-vaccinated places, like Vermont, where about 72% of the population is fully inoculated. Meanwhile, some states, like Michigan, report that fully vaccinated people are increasingly adding to their Covid-19 numbers -- reflecting both the rising number of vaccinated people and the vaccines' waning effectiveness among people who got the shots early on. The stalled progress is an unwelcome turn as more people are expected to travel and congregate indoors during the Thanksgiving holiday. \n\n  Quote of the Day: \n\n  \"After nearly two years, I don't blame anyone for feeling done with the Covid-19 pandemic. The unfortunate truth, however, is the pandemic isn't done with us.\" \n\n  -- Don Herrington, interim director of the Arizona Dept. of Health Services \n\n  -- Many governments are treading cautiously in rolling out Covid-19 vaccinations to children. \n\n  -- More schools are opting to use test-to-stay screening protocols over quarantines to keep children in classrooms after they have been exposed to Covid-19. \n\n  -- International-student enrollment in U.S. colleges and universities is showing signs of a rebound this fall after a pandemic-induced decline. \n\n \n\n  President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will meet virtually today, putting Mr. Biden's China policy to the test as the two attempt to build on signs of easing hostility. Both sides set modest expectations and don't anticipate concrete outcomes. Broadly, Mr. Biden and his team have settled on a strategy of managing the relationship through what they call \"intense diplomacy.\" \n\n  -- As the U.S. seeks to counter China's global influence, The Journal looks at how Mr. Biden's infrastructure plan aims to compete with China's Belt and Road initiative. \n\n  In other world news... \n\n  -- China's social mobility has stalled, and inequality has worsened. \n\n  -- A Chinese state-controlled company bought an Italian military-drone manufacturer and transferred its know-how and technology without authorities' knowledge. \n\n  -- Poland, locked in an escalating culture war within the EU for several years, now finds itself on the front lines of Europe's external conflict with migrants and Russia. \n\n  -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi,

four-decade high in November, as strong consumer demand collided with pandemic-related supply constraints. \n\n     The Labor Department said the consumer-price index -- which measures what consumers pay for goods and services -- rose 6.8% in November from the same month a year ago. That was the fastest pace since 1982 and the sixth straight month in which inflation topped 5%. \n\n     The so-called core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 4.9% in November from a year earlier. That was a sharper increase than October's 4.6% rise, and the highest rate since 1991. \n\n     The increase in prices for new vehicles, which came in at 11.1% in November, was the largest on record, as were those for men's apparel and living room, kitchen and dining room furniture. A 7.9% surge in fast-food restaurant prices last month marked the sharpest on record too. \n\n     The steady rise in restaurant prices during the past few months is a sign of pass-through from wages into higher prices, economists say. That dynamic is increasingly showing up in other industries. Wages tracked by the Atlanta Fed climbed 4.3% in November, up from 4.1% in October and the highest since 2007. \n\n     Some energy prices showed signs of easing -- in part because of fear in the financial markets that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 could slow growth. But gasoline rose at a 6.1% monthly rate for the second straight month. \n\n     The November prices trend came before the emergence of the Omicron variant, which poses a new threat from a pandemic that is well into its second year. But the sharp price increases are the result of a booming economy that has developed imbalances in supply and demand as the U.S. continues to recover from the pandemic. \n\n     \"We have tremendous spending by consumers. A lot of people are getting hired. Demand is huge,\" Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics, Inc. said. He added that higher-than-expected inflation implies a needed pullback in fiscal and monetary stimulus. \"Even after doing that, the economy should still be in super shape producing growth rates and earnings not seen in decades.\" \n\n     On a monthly basis, the CPI increased a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in November from the prior month, about the same as October's 0.9% increase. \n\n     The latest strong inflation report strengthens the case for Federal Reserve officials to commit to hastening the wind-down of their stimulus efforts, paving the way to raise interest rates in the spring to curb inflation. \n\n     \"I think the Fed already got ahead of today's data by pre-announcing that they will accelerate the taper next week,\" said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC. \n\n     Stocks and oil prices gained and government bond yields fell after the inflation figures reinforced expectations that the economy should slow gradually next year as the Fed tightens monetary policy. \n\n     Unlike in past recoveries, strong demand for goods such as autos, furniture and appliances has driven much of the inflation surge. Prices for services -- such as for travel and recreation -- have generally climbed much less with softer demand. The holiday season is likely exacerbating these dynamics, Ms. Markowska said, adding the supply and demand imbalance will continue to widen. \n\n     A shortage of available workers is also affecting inflation and the overall economy, pushing companies to raise prices to offset higher labor costs. Companies are setting aside an average 3.9% of total payroll for wage increases next year, the most since 2008, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a private research group. \n\n     Tip Hongchindaget said that while demand at her Charlotte, N.C., restaurant is booming, higher costs and scarce labor are squeezing her business. A surge in chicken prices has wiped out what used to be a reliable source of profit for her restaurant, Rice & Spice Thai Street Food. And though sales are strong, the dearth of workers has prompted her to start closing for Sunday lunch. \n\n     \"It has happened like a storm, and it just keeps coming,\" she said. \"I don't think we can keep giving more people higher wages.\" \n\n     Ms. Tip said she is now researching technological upgrades that might require less labor. She is reluctant to increase prices after having done so earlier this year, especially since the area's other Asian restaurants haven't raised prices much. \"If we raise the price again this time, I'm pretty sure it's going to impact\" sales, she said. \n\n     On Thursday Costco Wholesale Corp. said its prices likely grew between 4.5% to 5% during the most recent quarter, a bit higher than the company predicted the previous quarter. \"I think it's going to continue,\" said Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti on a call to discuss earnings. \"Hopefully, we're getting towards the top and it'll start flattening out and subsiding, but we'll see.\" \n\n     Hormel Foods Corp., maker of Spam and Skippy peanut butter, said on Thursday that it raised prices on many of its different pantry staples, citing sharply higher costs. The Minnesota-based company said it raised the price of its Jennie-O turkey, for example, to counter higher feed costs and labor shortages. \"In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey and feed prices to remain above historical levels,\" said chief financial officer James Sheehan on a call with analysts. \n\n     Sixty percent of small-business owners said they had increased prices in the previous 90 days, according to a November survey of more than 560 small businesses for The Wall Street Journal by Vistage Worldwide Inc., a business-coaching and peer-advisory firm. Eighty percent of the companies surveyed reported increased labor costs, while 72% said their suppliers had raised prices. \n\n     Companies are still struggling to get materials, though supply constraints were showing signs of easing before the Omicron variant emerged. The most prominent example of strained supply chains is a shortage of semiconductors that has hamstrung auto production. \n\n     Economists generally see inflationary pressure from supply constraints easing in 2022 as sidelined workers return, consumer demand for goods cools and production ramps up. However, they also expect those to be replaced by more persistent sources of price pressure such as rent and medical care. \n\n     Aichi Amemiya, senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities, said a continuing shift in consumer spending from goods to services should also help calm inflation. Signs of improving transportation costs and auto production hint that inflationary pressure could begin easing early next year, though it is likely to remain high in December, Mr. Amemiya said. \n\n     Covid-19 continues to be a wild-card factor. Past virus surges have put downward pressure on prices for travel, recreation and other services that involve in-person interaction. However, a resurgence of cases ultimately could push inflation higher by increasing consumer demand for goods and triggering shutdowns of factories and ports, Mr. Amemiya said. \n\n     Persistently elevated inflation is hitting consumer budgets. \n\n     Dallas resident Greg Chu noticed a rise in his gasoline costs earlier this year -- an increase so sharp that he said he took his car to a mechanic. But there was nothing wrong with his car: The problem was much higher gas prices. The 27-year-old has taken to meticulously planning his day to reduce driving. Since food prices began rising last spring, he also is dining out less and is buying less meat and dairy at the grocery store. \n\n     \"Inflation has changed how I drive, shop and eat,\" said Mr. Chu, who works as an accountant. \"I can afford to pay these price increases, but at the cost of reducing my other expenses or savings, which I am not willing to do.\" \n\n     --Sarah Nassauer and

MARKET WRAPS \n\n  Stocks: \n\n  European stocks traded mostly higher after upbeat trading in Asia. \n\n  \"A decent start to the week for markets in Europe and Asia hopefully sets the tone for a better five-day trading session for investors, given the carnage we've seen for most of January,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \n\n  In the commodity space, crude prices continued their march higher, sitting at the highest levels since 2014. \n\n  \"There'll be a continued focus on the trajectory of oil prices over the week ahead, particularly with the OPEC+ group meeting on Wednesday to discuss a March production increase,\" said Reid. \"The geopolitical tensions out of Eastern Europe also helped drive oil prices higher, as Russia is one of the world's largest exporters.\" \n\n  Stocks to watch: LVMH's unmatched earnings give it scope for continued investment in the fast-changing luxury sector, Credit Suisse said after last week's expectation-beating 2021 results. \n\n  The French luxury goods major booked yearly operating profit of EUR17 billion, multiple times higher than what most peers can expect, and this looks sustainable as the core fashion division's high margins solidify, CS said. \n\n  This gives the group firepower for investment in product and marketing and to tap new sales opportunities, the bank added. Sales growth should normalize in 2022 as comparables get tougher, but should nevertheless reach double digits organically in the year, CS said, keeping an outperform rating on LVMH stock and raising its target to EUR800 from EUR720. \n\n  Low-cost carrier Ryanair's 3Q saw an improvement in pricing despite December's Omicron-related restrictions as its EUR25 average fare was only around 24% below 2019's 3Q, an improvement from the 31% difference in the 2Q comparison, Citi said. \n\n  However, pricing in 4Q would have been hurt by late Christmas and new year bookings and the Omicron coronavirus, the U.S. bank said. \n\n  Citi now expects net income loss for fiscal 2022 to be EUR366 million, compared with a prior net loss expectation of EUR367 million, with earnings estimates for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025 rising by more than 6%, 1%, and 4%, respectively, the bank said. Citi rates the stock buy with a EUR20 target price. \n\n  Pearson's acquisition of digital-credentialing firm Credly for a total firm value of $200 million is a sensible move and should be well received, Citi said. \n\n  The FTSE 100 education company's acquisition coherently expands its suite of services in what is currently an underscale professional learning operation, and at a group level it underlines the shift of emphasis away from higher education--something of a monomaniacal focus for the market, the U.S. bank said. \n\n  Pearson using its financial net cash position of around GBP200 million to accelerate its business mix shift also makes good financial sense, Citi added. Citi retains its buy rating on Pearson's stock. Shares are down 0.4% at 604.0 pence. \n\n  Data in focus: The absolute majority secured by the Portuguese socialist party, led by Prime Minister Antonio Costa, in Sunday's parliamentary election is likely to be positive for the country's economy, economists from Berenberg said. \n\n  Costa will now be able to pass the budget, and Portugal can begin to spend its 16.6 billion euros in EU recovery funds, which could lift the country's GDP be between 1.5% and 2.4% by 2026, they said. \n\n  Portugal's household median net income remains among the lowest in the eurozone, and Costa wants to increase income per worker, but will continue to safeguard the country's fiscal stability, Berenberg said. \"With largely sensible economic policies, Portugal can stay on a solid recovery track,\" the German bank said. \n\n  Germany's inflation is expected to ease to 4.7% on year in January, following a reading of 5.3% in December. This would be the first decline in the yearly rate since June 2021. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast German inflation at 4.3% in January. \n\n  One key driver of the deceleration is likely to have been the unwinding of the VAT effect that drove up inflation rates significantly last year, the Italian bank said. \n\n  \"A stronger deceleration is likely to have been prevented by energy companies passing on markedly higher electricity and natural-gas prices to consumers,\" UniCredit said. \n\n  Following the release of North-Rhine Westphalia's inflation data, which showed 5.1% inflation in January, UniCredit said the deceleration may be even more slight. \n\n  U.S. Markets: \n\n  Stock futures crept higher Monday, but major indexes are poised to close January with heavy losses following a month of volatile trading due to expected interest-rate increases. \n\n  \"There has been extreme volatility so far this year,\" said Louise Dudley, an equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. \"People are particularly worried with the interest-rate expectations continuing to get higher. We're definitely seeing from the U.S. that they're very on top of the inflation numbers-they're going to do everything they can.\" \n\n  Ms. Dudley said she expects that volatility will lessen as investors get more clarity over whether inflation has peaked and how companies expect to be impacted by higher prices for energy, labor and materials. Earnings are due ahead of Monday's market open from Otis Worldwide and L3Harris Technologies. \n\n  \"Companies are managing at the moment to hit their expectations, but it's the outlooks that have definitely got a big cautious question mark on them and people are worried about how much further some of these costs will go,\" she said. \n\n  In the week ahead, the U.S. jobs report Friday will be a highlight. The Fed is closely watching employment data as it considers higher inflation and monetary policy. \n\n  And with corporate earnings season in full swing, company results will also be in the spotlight. More than 110 constituents of the S&P 500 report this week, with NXP Semiconductors in the day ahead. Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Exxon Mobil, and General Motors, are among many other big names that will report in the coming days. \n\n  Forex: \n\n  The dollar was slightly lower after last week's rally but declines should remain limited due to speculation about the Fed tightening monetary policy at a faster pace, ING said. \n\n  \"Mild consolidation could see [the DXY dollar index] briefly break under 97.05 to the 96.85 area--that should hold, however,\" ING analysts said. \n\n  While most of this week's U.S. economic data for January could miss expectations, this weakness caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant is well understood by the market and investors are more influenced by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's \"very hawkish\" comments at last Wednesday's meeting, they said. \n\n  The Bank of England could raise interest rates further on Thursday but this might not lift sterling, RBC Capital Markets said. \n\n  The BOE is likely to raise its key rate 25 basis points to 0.50%, the level at which it plans to start reducing its stock of purchased assets, RBC currency strategist Adam Cole said. \n\n  \"The market is not currently appreciating how that interaction between Bank Rate and balance sheet reduction means this will not be a normal tightening cycle and that current pricing for Bank Rate is too aggressive,\" he said. That could weigh on sterling over the medium term, he said. \n\n  Short-sellers built bets against sterling in the week to Jan. 25 despite expectations the Bank of England will raise interest rates again this Thursday, Rabobank said, citing the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \n\n  \"The money market has been positioned for a fair amount of tightening this year,\" Rabobank forex strategist Jane Foley said. \"That said, fears of a spike in the cost of living in the U.K. questions whether the BOE will be able to match these expectations.\" \n\n  Bitcoin was struggling to recover as it remains below the key $40,000 level but the weakness won't last, AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam said. \n\n  \"With mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies on the rise, by institutional investors and individuals alike, and backed by strong fundamentals, the future outlook of cryptocurrencies remains positive,\" he said. \n\n  Bitcoin falls 2.3% on the day to $37,213 but has recouped some of its losses since hitting a six-month low of $32,983 last Monday, according to CoinDesk. \n\n  Bonds: \n\n  The European Central Bank's rate decision on Thursday should be neutral for European credit markets, though inflation data due the day before could hurt market sentiment, UniCredit said. \n\n  \"While we expect that the ECB will not make any policy changes at the meeting, which should... be credit neutral, inflation concerns remain high and are likely to weigh on market sentiment,\" analysts at the bank said. They advise clients to stick to bonds maturing between three and five years to reduce price volatility. \n\n  The Bank of England may find itself, like the Fed last week, unable to rule out consecutive interest-rate rises this Thursday, Mizuho said. \"The message may be similar as that from the Fed,\" analysts said, adding that it will be difficult for BOE Governor Andrew Bailey to rule out hiking scenarios when the questions inevitably come. \n\n  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's comments signaling that the Fed could raise rates several times in consecutive months prompted investors to dump stocks and bonds. \n\n  The BOE is expected to lift the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.5% this Thursday, which would trigger a stop to the reinvestments of proceeds of maturing gilts and open the door to a further rate rise in March. \n\n  The Italian presidential election has resulted in the most market-friendly outcome, with Sergio Mattarella remaining president and Mario Draghi as prime minister, nonetheless, Italian risk premia is expected to widen moderately this year, Oliver Eichmann, head of rates for EMEA fixed income at DWS, said. \n\n  \"With a view to the further development of the risk premium on Italian government bonds, we nevertheless expect a moderate widening over a 12-month horizon,\" he said. \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 31,

-- WSJ\n\n  S&P 500 and Dow lose 1% as investors adjust portfolios for higher interest rates \n\nBy Gunjan Banerji and Joe Wallace \n\n     U.S. stocks gave up early gains and turned lower, extending a recent stretch of losses that have pulled major indexes down to start the year. \n\n     The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 166.64 points, or 1.1%, to 14340.26. It finished the day 10.7% below its all-time closing high, set in November. A decline of greater than 10% is considered a correction for a stock index. \n\n     The S&P 500 fell 44.35 points, or 1%, to 4532.76. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 339.82 points, or 1%, to 35028.65. \n\n     Wednesday's trading activity continued a tumultuous stretch for major indexes, with stocks paring their earlier gains and closing near session lows. In the first weeks of January, many investors have started dumping shares of technology companies and piling into other corners of the market in anticipation of rising interest rates. Some investors are positioning for the Covid-19 pandemic to turn into an endemic. \n\n     Investors have stepped up bets that the Federal Reserve and other major central banks will tighten monetary policy in the coming months, withdrawing a pillar of support for markets. Mounting expectations of interest-rate rises follow evidence that the drivers of inflation have broadened beyond the supply-chain shock that fueled price gains for much of 2021. \n\n     That has led to big swings, leaving many stocks in a bear market and stoking giant rotations among different sectors. \n\n     Recent volatility is  \"really all about inflation and how aggressive central banks are going to be to counteract it,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum Asset Management, adding that inflation could also curtail economic growth by knocking consumption. \"Certainly, the market is nervous at the moment,\" he said. \n\n     Government-bond prices edged up Wednesday, pushing down yields. Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 1.826% from 1.866% Tuesday, which was their highest level since January 2020. Yields on interest-rate-sensitive two-year notes were down to 1.022% from 1.038% Tuesday. \n\n     The moves in the bond market have rippled through stocks, and particularly the tech sector. The Nasdaq Composite is down 8% this year, a much sharper decline than the S&P or Dow industrials. \n\n     \"There is currently a knee-jerk reaction occurring in the market\" in response to rising bond yields, said Dev Kantesaria, founder of Valley Forge Capital. \n\n     And there are signs that individual investors -- a key force behind 2021's stock-market rally -- are cooling on tech, according to analysts at Vanda Research. Retail investors have been buying shares of financials and energy companies, while their purchases of highflying stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia have been dwindling, Vanda said. \n\n     Other corners of the market have staged a strong rally. The S&P 500's value index has been outperforming its growth index by around 7.4 percentage points this month, on pace for the biggest monthly outperformance since December 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data. \n\n     Some of the biggest lenders in the U.S. reported rising earnings. Bank of America shares rose 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $46.44 after the lender reported a jump in fourth-quarter profits. Morgan Stanley's shares gained $1.72, or 1.8%, to $95.73, after profits that topped forecasts. \n\n     U.S. Bancorp fell almost 8% after the bank holding company posted a rise in compensation costs. This earnings season, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have also reported shelling out more in compensation. \n\n     Procter & Gamble said consumers were undeterred by higher prices, leading to higher revenue and lifting shares of the consumer-goods company around 3.4%. \n\n     Over the next week, investors will be parsing earnings from big tech companies including Netflix and Microsoft. Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co., said he'll be closely tracking the results to see what guidance executives provide for future quarters. \n\n     \"I'm hoping for them to not come out and guide lower,\" Mr. Morgan said. \n\n     Elsewhere, Europe's most closely watched government-bond yield turned positive for the first time since 2019. The yield on 10-year German bund rose as high as 0.021% Wednesday after trading in negative territory for over 30 months. \n\n     Oil prices rose. Brent crude futures rose 1.1% to $88.44, hitting the highest level since October 2014. Wednesday's moves extend a rally driven in part by the potential for supply disruptions in Russia and the Middle East. \n\n     Overseas stock markets were mixed following Tuesday's selloff on Wall Street.

In threatening those flows Moscow risks disrupting supplies to China while setting off a scramble among customers in fragile Middle Eastern economies at a time when food inflation is already high. \n\n     Missiles and airstrikes have battered cities throughout Ukraine, including port cities key to the country's agricultural exports. Commercial shipping in and out of the country has largely ground to a halt. \n\n     An ocean vessel chartered by one of the world's largest food suppliers, Cargill Inc., was hit by a projectile off the coast of Ukraine in the Black Sea on Thursday. Minnesota-based Cargill, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is seaworthy and no one was injured. \n\n     U.S. grains giants have also begun closing operations. Archer Daniels Midland Co. closed its facilities in Ukraine, which include a grain terminal at a port near Odessa. Bunge Ltd. also closed its offices and facilities in Ukraine. \n\n     Wheat futures traded in Chicago have jumped almost 12% so far this week, hitting their highest level since July 2012. European wheat prices have soared 15% for the week. \n\n     Russia's incursions in the south and in the east strike at the heart of Ukraine's most productive wheat-growing regions, which stretch across the country's southern half, from Kharkiv on the eastern border with Russia to Odessa on the country's Black Sea coastline. \n\n     The fighting shouldn't have much impact on the planting or harvesting of crops, according to Mike Lee, owner of Green Square Agro Consulting, a crop forecasting company that specializes in the Black Sea region. Wheat, for instance, is planted in September and October and harvested in July and the following months. \n\n     \"Whatever happens, there is a crop in the ground,\" he said. \n\n     Still, if the situation on the ground escalates to a position where farmers can't apply pesticides or fertilizers to their wheat, which will start in March, that could reduce the yield by up to a third, presuming they can harvest in July, Mr. Lee said. \n\n     While a large portion of crops are exported around the time they are harvested, cargoes will leave Ukraine throughout the year, he said. Over 700,000 metric tons of wheat are exported during each of the months of February, March and April, according to government statistics. That is well below the 3.64 million and 4.5 million tons exported in August and September respectively, but enough to disturb crop supply chains. Damaged infrastructure and port congestion could also affect trading well into the year. \n\n     Shipping in the Azov Sea -- an extension of the Black Sea to the east of Crimea -- has stopped. Ships are banned from passing through the narrow Kerch Strait into the shallow sea, and ship-tracking data showed dozens of ships, including the bulk carriers that transport grains, had anchored in the strait. \n\n     Russian and Ukrainian ports on the Azov Sea export up to 18 million tons of grains each year, said Andrey Sizov, managing director of SovEcon, a Russian research firm focusing on Black Sea grains. \n\n     Damage to port infrastructure or a Russian naval blockade would also threaten the much larger Ukrainian ports around Odessa and Mykolaiv. Ports around the two cities handle upward of 50 million metric tons of grain each year and are crucial to Ukraine's agricultural industry, said Mr. Sizov. \n\n     Simon Arnold, co-founder of Dubai-based Aria Commodities, said his trading firm would hold off from trading grains in Ukraine for at least a month or until the situation appears resolved. \n\n     Disruptions to Ukraine's grain trade will also be difficult for its main customers, as the world already swallows food-price inflation. \n\n     Beijing has made Ukraine a centerpiece of its efforts to diversify grain supplies and increase food security. Chinese demand for corn is at a record high after Beijing encouraged domestic producers to pile into hog production. \n\n     Ukraine exported a record 8.2 million tons of corn to China in 2021, making up nearly 30% of total Chinese corn imports. Ukraine accounted for as much as 86% of Chinese corn imports in 2019. Ukraine also exports barley and sunflower oil to China. \n\n     Disruptions to Ukrainian corn exports come at an especially difficult time for Chinese pork producers, who have been losing money as hog prices drop. \n\n     Egypt and Indonesia are the largest buyers of Ukrainian wheat, each accounting for more than 15% of Ukraine's wheat imports, or more than 3 million tons, according to data from Trade Data Monitor. Other major buyers are Turkey and Pakistan, which each imported 1.7 million and 1.3 million tons of wheat, respectively, from Ukraine in 2021. \n\n     For Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer, access to affordable wheat is a question of political stability. Rallying prices have led to street protests, including ones in 2011 during the Arab Spring, which toppled the government of Hosni Mubarak. \n\n     On Thursday, Egypt canceled an international tender to buy wheat after receiving just one bid amid the uncertainty surrounding Black Sea grains supplies. Egypt's import agency typically receives between 10 and 20 bids in its closely watched tenders. \n\n     For Ukraine itself, the agricultural sector is one of the key bright spots of its economy. The yellow in the country's flag symbolizes its crop fields. \n\n     Any disruption to its grains trade will be painful. With more than 41 million hectares of agricultural land, covering 70% of the country, agriculture is Ukraine's largest export and the largest part of its economy, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year, according to the country's statistics service. \n\n     Last year the Ukrainian government changed its laws to allow hundreds of thousands of small and medium-size farmers to buy and sell land. That allowed them to borrow money on the land they had, and invest those proceeds. \n\n     The U.S. and European governments had already zeroed in on agriculture as a way to develop the Ukrainian economy. The U.S. Agency for International Development, for instance, says it has provided around $13 million since late 2019 to support the passage of these laws and educate farmers in how to take advantage of the changes. \n\n     Even before the invasion, geopolitical tensions were putting pressure on Ukrainian farmers. \n\n     Larissa Boden, whose business Agro-focus Ltd was planting its next crop of asparagus last week, has seen a 30% increase in the price of fuel. A bank that Agro-focus, the country's largest asparagus farmer, had been negotiating a loan with has now put those talks on hold. Ms. Boden, who farms in the south close to Crimea, was also concerned that war would mean the seasonal workers farms depend upon would leave to work in more stable countries. \n\n     On Thursday, after hearing explosions in the early morning, she said she stayed indoors and off her fields. \n\n     Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com, Alistair MacDonald at Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com

Like other farmers across Ukraine, his crop for this year is also imperiled. \n\n     Global concerns that Russia's invasion would curtail Ukraine's 2022 harvest have come to fruition. The crop shortfall will extend to the many countries that rely on Ukraine for wheat, corn and cooking oil. \n\n     With wheat already in the ground, and only a few weeks left to plant corn, farmers in Ukraine can't get needed fertilizers and chemicals. They are low on fuel for tractors and other farm equipment. Workers are quitting to join the fight or to leave the country, leaving farms short-handed. \n\n     Mr. Borisov said he and other farmers need to start their corn, sunflower and barley crops in April and May. That is now in doubt, and the impact on food supplies and prices will be felt world-wide. \n\n     \"We hope we will plant, and we want to plant, but the situation is totally unpredictable,\" Mr. Borisov said. \"You cannot build a forecast on Vladimir Putin.\" \n\n     Ukraine's nutrient-rich soils yield 10% of global wheat exports, 14% of corn exports and about half of the world's sunflower oil, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In just three weeks, war disrupted Ukraine agriculture, triggering higher prices as well as the threat of global shortages. Much of the exports go to developing economies already struggling with food-cost inflation. \n\n     Mr. Borisov's farm is close to the border with Russia, in an area that was overrun on the first day of fighting. He had been away when the Russians invaded. His parents, who live close to his farm, called him to say hundreds of tanks were moving past the fields. \n\n     Russia's naval blockade and fighting around Ukraine ports has all but stopped maritime shipping and left limited means for transporting goods. Wheat prices have hit record levels over the effect on Ukrainian and Russian shipments. \n\n     Like Ukraine's military efforts, the country's agriculture sector is rallying. Exports are being rerouted, and Ukraine is asking the U.S., Poland, France and others for supplies, said Taras Vysotskyi, Ukraine's deputy minister of agrarian policy and food. In the best case scenario, the country's agricultural exports will fall by a fifth this year compared with 2021, he said, but a much bigger drop is more likely. \n\n     Should Russian forces leave immediately, Dmitry Skorniakov said, his four farms would still struggle to resume work. Tractors, chemical sprayers and a grain silo were destroyed on one farm located close to the besieged city of Mariupol, he said. Some of his workers have left to join the country's defense. \n\n     Further along the Black Sea coast, Larissa Boden's asparagus farm, Ukraine's largest, is in territory now held by Russia. Neighboring farms in what is one of Ukraine's most important growing regions have had fields chewed up by tanks and artillery fire, she said. \n\n     Ms. Boden planned to take delivery of 340,000 asparagus crowns from the Netherlands to plant more crops by April. She made a down payment of EUR78,000, about $85,500. After the invasion, she canceled the order and asked the supplier to try to sell them elsewhere. \n\n     Like Mr. Skorniakov, she fears she won't have enough workers. \"We don't have people,\" Ms. Boden said, \"we have tanks.\" \n\n     The government of Ukraine, whose flag is said to depict a blue sky over a yellow field, has made farmworkers largely exempt from conscripted military service. Many are joining anyway. \n\n     Even on Mr. Skorniakov's farm near the comparatively peaceful border with Poland, his remaining farm hands are able to do less than 60% of the work, he said. Fertilizers and chemicals haven't been delivered, Mr. Skorniakov said. Fuel he typically buys from Russia and Belarus is unattainable. \n\n     \"It's a disaster,\" he said. \n\n     On track \n\n     Ukraine is the world's fourth and fifth largest exporter of corn and wheat, respectively, according to the USDA, and 85% of its crop exports travel by sea, said Mr. Vysotskyi, the government minister. \n\n     With ports closed, the country is trying to shift some exports through its Western borders. Around 25% to 30% are now heading to Romania, Poland and Slovakia by train and on to other ports, Mr. Vysotskyi said. \n\n     It is an imperfect solution. Ukraine's railways don't accommodate as high a volume of crops as ports can, and grains must be transferred to different train cars at the border because Ukraine's Soviet-era railways use a different gauge than those in the European Union. The shipping detours will add 10% to 15% to the cost of crops, Mr. Vysotskyi said. \n\n     The war in Ukraine is inflating global food prices that are already at decade highs, largely from the pandemic's lingering supply-chain troubles. Wheat futures are up 42% so far this year; the price of corn has risen 27%. \n\n     Worsening food supply prospects, Russia, also a major grain exporter, is struggling to get its crops out of the Black Sea. JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimated a decline of 60% in Russian grain shipments in the second week of March compared with the typical volume for that period in past years. \n\n     Grain is used for animal feed, and the supply interruptions have already hit the meat industry. \"We are seeing massive increases in the price of milk and meat, and this is not short-term,\" said Chris Elliott, a professor and expert on international food supply chains at Queens University, Belfast. \n\n     New bounty \n\n     Over the past two decades, the world's wheat trade has almost doubled, in large part because of stepped-up exports from Ukraine and Russia, according to the Agricultural Market Information System, a Group of 20 global food policy initiative. As recently as 15 years ago, Ukraine's grain exports were less than 7% of the country's 2020 total, according to government statistics. \n\n     An estimated 25 countries source at least half of their supplies from the two countries, according to AMIS. \"It is obviously disconcerting that some countries rely so strongly on Russia and or Ukraine for their wheat supplies,\" said Denis Drechsler, a project manager for the group. \n\n     Today, more than 41 million hectares of agricultural land cover 70% of Ukraine. Agriculture is the largest part of the Ukrainian economy, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year. \n\n     It wasn't always that way. When Kees Huizinga arrived in Ukraine 20 years ago, straight from Dutch agriculture college, he saw potential in the country's many abandoned fields. \n\n     Mr. Huizinga farms wheat, barley and sugar beet, and raises livestock in central Ukraine. Three weeks ago, he paid the equivalent of 80 cents for a liter of gas. Now, it is $1.65, he said, \"If you can even get your hands on it.\" \n\n     Mr. Huizinga said he needs to plant his corn within three weeks. His farm has enough fuel for maybe three-quarters of a regular crop. The shortage of chemicals and fertilizers also will diminish crop yields, he said. \n\n     Farmers reported having, on average, only 20% of the fuel they needed, according to an online government poll of 1,700 farmers, who represented 15% of Ukraine's arable land. \n\n     At around 5 a.m. on Feb. 24, the first day of the Russian invasion, Mr. Huizinga said he heard what sounded like a jet fighter flying high above his farm. Then he felt the windows and doors shudder. A Russian missile struck an ammunition dump. \n\n     \"Soon, what is a disaster for farmers here will become one for elsewhere in the world,\" Mr. Huizinga said, \"when they can't get our food.\" \n\n     --Will Horner, Amira El-Fekki and Adnan Ghassan contributed to this article. \n\n  Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  March 20, 2022 13:09 ET (17:09 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.900181Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T18:36:28.472748Z", "inner_id": 90, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7723, "annotations": [{"id": 6834, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 0, "end": 19, "text": "European Currencies", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "875158", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 111, "end": 130, "text": "European currencies", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "381544", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 467, "end": 486, "text": "war against Ukraine", "labels": ["War"]}, "id": "255842", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1336, "end": 1341, "text": "zloty", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "548760", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1574, "end": 1581, "text": "imports", "labels": ["Trade Balance"]}, "id": "162974", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1624, "end": 1633, "text": "inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "641683", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1527, "end": 1552, "text": "Steep falls in a currency", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "nDuUYgtHm3", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "manual"}, {"from_id": "nDuUYgtHm3", "to_id": "162974", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}, {"from_id": "162974", "to_id": "641683", "type": "relation", "direction": "right", "labels": ["Increases"]}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-27T18:26:36.912166Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T18:26:36.912192Z", "draft_created_at": "2025-03-27T18:25:04.490660Z", "lead_time": 249.908, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 8, "unique_id": "3cf5f625-2f6e-4980-8e65-eefc3d652861", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7723, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2150, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2150], "data": {"inner_id": 434, "text": "European Currencies Hit Multiyear Lows As Energy Concerns Prompt Flight to Dollar\n\n  By Caitlin Ostroff \n\n \n\n  European currencies fell against the dollar Monday as investors worried that a potential crackdown on Russian energy imports by the U.S. and its allies would hurt economic growth in the region. \n\n  The euro fell 0.6% to $1.0866, its lowest level since May 2020, according to FactSet.

of job openings continued to dwarf the number of people looking for employment last month, according to private-sector estimates. \n\n     Employers had 11.2 million job openings on March 18, according to estimates from jobs site Indeed. That is a slight decline from the number the government reported in January but remains a historically high figure. \n\n     Strong demand for workers is a key factor pushing up wages and inflation in the current U.S. labor market, despite economic uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \n\n     The Labor Department is set to release estimates on Tuesday at 10 a.m. of February job openings and the number of people who left their positions voluntarily. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the figures inched lower last month. The government data lag behind private-sector data by about a month. \n\n     Job openings soared in 2021 to a record 11.4 million in December, according to the Labor Department. Meanwhile, the number of times workers quit their jobs also soared, reaching a peak toward the end of last year. \n\n     The gap between the level of openings and the number of people who are unemployed and actively seeking work has persisted for several months. \n\n     \"Demand for labor is still incredibly high, but there's also progress happening, and we are on track to getting back to a pre-pandemic labor market based on many metrics by this year, potentially,\" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed. \n\n     Mr. Bunker said that the tightness in the labor market has already reduced in some sectors of the economy such as leisure and hospitality. He said this can be seen through quits trending down and wage growth cooling. \n\n     The average hourly pay for private-sector workers rose by just a penny in February, after growing by at least a dime a month over the last several months, and quits have been declining since peaking in November. \n\n     Hiring might get easier this year as more people seek jobs, said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. \n\n     \"A lot of government support that was helping people out is over -- the government cheese isn't coming anymore. They'll need to work in order to support themselves,\" Mr. Shapiro said. \"And kids are back in school, so parents don't have to worry about what to do with their kids.\" \n\n     The U.S. labor market still faces the challenge of elevated inflation, which rose 7.9% year-over-year in February, the highest in 40 years. \n\n     \"Everybody's reading about a high rate of inflation. They are seeing it at the gas pump, they are seeing it in the grocery stores, so that can cause employee demand for higher wage increases to kick up,\" said Patricia Buckley, managing director for economics at professional-services company Deloitte. \n\n     While consumers' expectations for inflation can affect wages, higher inflation can also lower demand for certain goods and services -- potentially also reducing some employers' demand for workers, Ms. Buckley said. \n\n     Because of higher costs, Michelle Pusateri, owner of Nana Joes Granola, a granola company in San Francisco, said she has tried to find ways to meet consumer demand without having to add more workers as she looks to minimize costs. \n\n     \"We have been looking at increasing efficiencies through automation, which would mean not having to hire more people,\" Ms. Pusateri said, citing the packaging process as one area of focus. \n\n     Write to Bryan Mena at bryan.mena@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END)

Rubin \n\n     FRANKFURT -- Economic growth is slowing in large parts of the globe as businesses struggle to navigate the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, pandemic-prompted lockdowns in China and high inflation. \n\n     Surveys of purchasing managers conducted over recent weeks indicate a loss of steam in major economies such as Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. in April. \n\n     While service businesses are benefiting as Covid-19 restrictions are removed and households spend some of the savings they amassed during the pandemic, manufacturing firms in many places are wrestling with higher costs and supply-chain disruptions, according to surveys by S&P Global released Friday. Around the world, businesses worry that the surge in living costs is dampening people's willingness to spend. \n\n     The war in Ukraine suddenly boosted prices and dampened demand in many countries, disrupting a generally strong global economy rebound from the shock of the pandemic. The recovery, bolstered by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, has driven down unemployment in advanced economies while adding to pressure on global supply chains strained by intermittent Covid-19 outbreaks. All that has pushed inflation to the highest levels in several decades on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n     In Germany, Europe's largest economy and a manufacturing powerhouse, the pace of growth in business activity slowed to a three-month low in April. S&P Global said its composite purchasing managers index for Germany slid to 54.5 from 55.1 in March. A reading above 50 indicates growth, while a level below 50 signals contraction. \n\n     The first fall in German manufacturing output since June 2020 was offset by a pickup of service-sector growth to the fastest pace since August. The autos sector was particularly hard hit, recording a steepening and marked loss of output, the surveys found. \n\n     Germany's Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said that its global sales declined by about 6% in the first quarter versus the same period a year earlier. BMW blamed \"the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the Covid lockdowns in China.\" \n\n     Rolf Breidenbach, chief executive of German auto supplier Hella GmbH Co. KGaA, said in an April 7 earnings statement, \"There are still massive supply shortages for certain electronic components and materials and the development of the coronavirus pandemic also continues to give rise to significant risks, especially in the Chinese market.\" \n\n     \"It can be assumed that the rise in prices, especially for raw and other materials, energy and logistics, will be ongoing,\" he added. \n\n     Germany's Bundesbank warned Friday that an embargo on Russian energy imports would reduce the nation's economic output by about 5% this year, triggering a recession and a further rise in inflation. European officials are currently discussing plans to phase out Russian oil imports. Germany buys more than half its natural-gas imports from Russia. \n\n     U.S. firms reported that business activity rose in April, but at a slower pace than in March, in part because higher inflation curbed the growth in spending on services, the S&P Global survey said. The composite purchasing managers index for the U.S. economy was 55.1, down from 57.7 in March and the lowest in three months. \n\n     \"Many businesses continue to report a tailwind of pent up demand from the pandemic, but companies are also facing mounting challenges from rising inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze, as well as persistent supply chain delays and labor constraints,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. \n\n     The PMI for U.S. services providers fell to 54.7 so far in April, from 58 in March and the lowest in three months. Manufacturers reported an upswing in April activity, with the PMI coming in at 59.7, the highest in seven months and up from 58.8 in February. \n\n     In the U.S., services providers raised their prices at the fastest rate on record, according to S&P Global, as firms passed on higher costs to customers. Manufacturers reported they are expanding their workforce numbers at the fastest rate since July 2021 as they try to relieve a backlog of orders. \n\n     The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday reduced its forecast for global economic growth this year by nearly a percentage point to 3.6%, down from 6.1% last year, warning that the war in Ukraine was adding to the economic strains wrought by the pandemic. The institution warned that recent lockdowns in key manufacturing and trade hubs in China would likely compound supply disruptions elsewhere. \n\n     China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 is battering consumer spending and hurting industrial production in an economy grappling with a real estate crunch and a regulatory crackdown on industries including technology and education. \n\n     \"What we see in China is that consumption is falling short; it is not recovering as strongly as necessary,\" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Wednesday. \n\n     In the U.K., the S&P Global surveys pointed to a marked cooling in the pace of economic growth in April. The composite PMI for the U.K. declined to 57.6 from 60.9 in March, reaching a three-month low. Businesses said rising living costs and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine had impacted client demand. Business optimism declined to the lowest since October 2020. \n\n     \"Firms are taking a more cautious approach to hiring and spending as demand cools and the outlook becomes gloomier, to suggest that the slowdown in the economy has further to run,\" Mr. Williamson said. \n\n     U.K. retail sales fell by an unexpected 1.4% in March, according to official data published Friday, while consumer confidence sank to the second-lowest on record in April. \n\n     \"The U.K. is teetering on the edge of a recession and that's before inflation hits 8% or higher later this year,\" said Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International. \n\n     The surveys indicated an acceleration in growth overall in the 19-nation eurozone, whose composite PMI rose to 55.8 in April from 54.9 in March. Business activity among service providers rose at the fastest rate since August, led by a boom in tourism and recreation activity. The pickup could encourage the European Central Bank to move ahead with aggressive interest-rate increases aimed at containing skyrocketing inflation, economists said. ECB officials have signaled that they could start to increase rates as soon as July. \n\n     Such moves add to headwinds that are ricocheting through global financial markets and weighing on asset prices. Borrowing costs are already rising sharply around the world as investors anticipate more rate rises from the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. \n\n     One bright spot in Europe is France, where growth picked up in recent weeks to the strongest level since January 2018, as a modest uptick in factory output was accompanied by the largest surge in services activity since the start of that year, S&P Global said. France's economy is less reliant than Germany's on manufacturing and on Russian energy. \n\n     Despite the record drop in inflation-adjusted wages, \"consumers still seem eager to spend some of their savings built up during the lockdowns now that restrictions have eased,\" said Bert Colijn, an economist with ING Bank. \n\n     Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Gabriel T.

losses on Tuesday as uncertainty over inflation, interest rates and the economy continued to weigh on the market. \n\n     All three major indexes opened higher, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite up 2.8% at one point. By late morning, stocks had mostly erased those gains and appeared on track to extend a brutal three-day slide. But as the afternoon wore on, investors turned their attention to Wednesday's report on consumer prices and the possibility that inflation may be peaking -- and stocks rebounded again. \n\n     The S&P 500 closed up 9.81 points, 0.2%, at 4001.05, a day after the broad index slumped 3.2% to its lowest level for the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 114.42 points, or 1%, to 11737.67. \n\n     \"The market was taking too negative of a read on the consumer-price index, leading to the afternoon recovery,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \n\n     The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight trading session, hitting a 52-week low. It closed down 84.96 points, or 0.3%, at 32160.74. \n\n     A cocktail of geopolitical risks and economic headwinds is posing the biggest threat to global growth in years and rattling markets. In the U.S., soaring inflation has prompted the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates and investors fear the move could tip the economy into recession. \n\n     Global markets are looking equally troubled. In China, resurgent Covid-19 outbreaks and Beijing's strict approach to fighting them threaten to revive the supply chain bottlenecks that first drove inflation higher. In Europe, the war in Ukraine threatens to keep energy prices elevated and is weighing on the region's growth. \n\n     \"People came in this morning expecting a relief rally after being hammered the last few days,\" said Joe Quinlan, head of CIO Market Strategy for Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. \"But with inflation in the U.S., the Covid challenges in China and the war in Ukraine, rarely have we seen three major market-moving catalysts converge.\" \n\n     Early Tuesday, some investors snapped up shares that had been battered by those headwinds. \n\n     \"Everyone at this point is looking to see if we've bottomed,\" said Quincy Krosby, Chief Equity Strategist for LPL Financial. \"The instincts are that we haven't bottomed yet.\" \n\n     Wednesday's report on fresh consumer-price index data is expected to show inflation rose at a slower pace in April than the previous month, Ms. Krosby said. \n\n     Investor sentiment can turn on a dime, she added. In January 2019, a speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank would be patient with rate increases -- reversing a steep market selloff. \n\n     The market has entered a new era, Mr. Quinlan said, and investors are more inclined to wait for solid evidence that those challenges have subsided before betting the stocks have reached a bottom. \n\n     \"Investors are very skeptical now,\" he said. \"They want to see the data. They don't want to listen to policy makers. Any improvements build the scaffolding for the bottom. But we're not there yet.\" \n\n     Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said Tuesday that he believes the Fed can achieve a \"softish landing\" for the U.S. economy while raising rates, though the unemployment rate could rise. \n\n     \"By 2023 you are very likely to see growth slowing very significantly, and the specter of recessions is really starting to loom,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"What we are seeing is the realization that it is going to be very tough for the Fed to get that soft landing just right.\" \n\n     Investors on Tuesday were welcoming signs that the conflict in Ukraine wasn't escalating and a planned EU embargo on Russian oil could face delays, Ms. Shah said. \n\n     Peloton Interactive fell $1.23, or 8.7%, to $12.90 after reporting declining sales and mounting losses as the stationary-bike maker struggles with the return to prepandemic consumer habits. \n\n     Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. surged by $56.86, or 68%, to $140 after Pfizer said it would buy the rest of the company for around $11.6 billion. \n\n     Duke Realty rose $1.87, or 3.9%, to $49.58 after Prologis said it had made an offer to buy the real-estate investment trust for about $23.7 billion. Prologis fell $6.96, or 5.3%, to $125.41. \n\n     The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.990% from 3.080% on Monday. \n\n     Brent crude oil fell $3.48, or 3.3%, to $102.46 a barrel. Oil prices had been rising for the past few months, but concerns that China's lockdowns will sap demand for commodities have taken some steam off the rally. \n\n     Demand for oil in China is likely to rebound sharply when restrictions start to ease, though the European Union's proposed ban on imports of Russian oil remains an overhang, said Daniel Hynes, a senior commodity strategist at ANZ in Sydney. \n\n     \"The fundamentals are still very tilted toward an extremely tight market with certainly risks skewed to further declines in supply over the next three to six months,\" Mr. Hynes said. \n\n     Bitcoin prices edged lower after a steep selloff. The world's largest cryptocurrency on Tuesday traded at $30,959.99 as of 5 p.m. ET, down 0.4% from $31,075.70 at the same time a day earlier. \n\n     Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.6% lower, the Shanghai Composite rose 1.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 1.8%. \n\n     Write to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com, Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com \n\n     Corrections & Amplifications \n\n     The S&P 500 was previously up 0.7%.

The strategists expect the \"hawks\" to become worried about recession closing the window for raising rates. \n\n  U.S. Markets: \n\n  Stock futures traded modestly lower on Powell's hawkish pivot. \n\n  Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that while Powell's sentiment was not \"necessarily new, his explicit comment that neutral rates are 'not a stopping point' garnered focus\" on Wall Street. \n\n  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.964% from 2.969% Tuesday. \n\n  Shares on the move premarket: \n\n  Lowe's was up slightly ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report. Home-improvement rival Home Depot finished with a gain of 1.7% Tuesday after earnings topped analysts' expectations and it raised guidance for 2022. \n\n  --- \n\n  Target gained 0.4%. It reports earnings Wednesday. Shares of the retailer fell 1.4% Tuesday after Walmart missed first-quarter earnings expectations and forecast a decline in full-year per-share earnings. \n\n  Forex: \n\n  The scope for the euro to rise against the dollar looks limited as the market's expectations for interest-rate rises from the ECB seem too aggressive, said ING. \n\n  Markets are pricing in too much tightening for the ECB but not for the Fed, while the U.S.-eurozone growth divergence will become more relevant into the summer, exacerbated by the EU-Russia standoff on commodities, said ING. \n\n  \"With this in mind, we suspect that any further rally in EUR/USD may start to lose steam around the 1.0650-1.0700 area, with risks of a return below 1.0500 in the near term being quite material.\" \n\n  --- \n\n  Sterling fell after data showed U.K. inflation accelerated further in April, hitting 9%, and adding pressure on already strained household incomes. Economists polled by the WSJ expected inflation to reach 9.1%. \n\n  \"Inflation in the U.K. is completely out of control, and there is no doubt that soaring inflation is having a negative influence on disposable incomes,\" said AvaTrade analyst Naeem Aslam. \n\n  The Bank of England is under pressure to do more to control inflation but it is walking a fine line and can only do so much, he said. \n\n  Bonds: \n\n  Eurozone government bonds steadied in early European trading following a selloff Tuesday triggered by a risk-on mood in global markets. \n\n  --- \n\n  Citi estimates the fair value of France's new 0.75% February 2028 government bond 8 basis points above the yield of the 0% February 2027 OAT. \n\n  The French Treasury Agency will launch the new bond as part of a EUR10 billion-EUR11.5 billion auction Thursday where it will also reopen the 0% February 2025 OAT and the 0% February 2026 OAT. Citi said they see relative value in the February 2025 and February 2026 OAT on the French bond curve. \n\n  --- \n\n  The green premium on Denmark's 0% November 2031 green bond, which will be reopened at auction on Wednesday, has narrowed to 1 basis point versus its conventional twin bond from around 5 bps at the launching auction in January, said Danske Bank. However, the green premium rarely goes below 1 bp and thus the 10-year Danish green bond looks cheap relative to EU peers such as Germany and the Netherlands. \n\n  The green premium, or \"greenium\", on the Danish green government bond is exactly measurable because the Danish debt management office issues green bonds in a twin-bond structure, first applied by Germany, with conventional and green bonds having identical maturity and coupons. \n\n  Energy: \n\n  Oil futures were more than 1% higher on easing Covid curbs in China and expectations for new sanctions on Russia, with DNB Markets forecasting prices will rise as high as $130 by the end of the year before easing to $115 next year. \n\n  A combination of increased demand as China eases its Covid-19 lockdowns and declining Russian oil production is likely to completely exhaust global capacity by the end of the year, said DNB Markets. \n\n  Macquarie said that while the near-term outlook for oil is strong, it expects prices to fade in the second half. \n\n  Brent crude has averaged $107 in the second quarter so far but a likely increase in supply from OPEC and other countries, potentially including Iran, should weigh on prices in the second half, Macquarie said. \n\n  \"We maintain our long-term assumption of $65 but defer this to the first quarter of 2024 [from 1Q of 2023],\" Macquarie said. \n\n  Metals: \n\n  Industrial metals weakened on gloomy signs for the global economy following Powell's comments Tuesday.

Apologizes Over Inflation Comment -- WSJ\n\n  By Megumi Fujikawa \n\n \n\n     TOKYO -- The Japanese central bank's governor apologized Wednesday for a comment suggesting he liked the way consumers were going along with higher prices, highlighting the political sensitivities of the yen's fall to a 20-year low. \n\n     The yen touched 134 yen to the dollar Wednesday, the lowest level since February 2002. The yen's value in dollar terms has fallen 16% since the beginning of the year, accelerating inflationary pressures because it takes more yen to buy imported goods denominated in dollars. Energy is a particular concern because Japan imports almost all of its oil and gas and needs dollars to pay for it. \n\n     In a speech Monday, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda pointed to data suggesting Japanese consumers have developed more tolerance for price rises. He seemed to welcome the trend as a sign the nation was getting away from a decadeslong deflationary mind-set that the central bank has blamed for keeping the economy in the doldrums. \n\n     But with parliamentary elections coming up in July, opposition parties seized on the comments to accuse Mr. Kuroda of cheering on high inflation. A Twitter hashtag that translates as \"we do not accept higher prices\" was trending. \n\n     Summoned to a parliamentary committee, Mr. Kuroda issued an apology. \n\n     \"The expression that households are tolerating price increases was completely inappropriate, and I take it back,\" Mr. Kuroda said. He said he recognized that paying more at the store was a painful choice for consumers and not something they welcomed. \n\n     Japan's consumer prices are rising at the fastest pace in three decades, although the inflation rate of 2.5% in April was well below 8.3% in the U.S. \n\n     The development is awkward for the Bank of Japan because it has long sought to achieve inflation of around 2%, but not in the way it is happening now. In the central bank's preferred scenario, modest price rises would come in tandem with wage increases and help generate a virtuous cycle of corporate investment and economic growth. Japan's ultralow interest rates would provide greater stimulus if wages and prices were rising steadily. \n\n     The only part of the scenario coming to fruition, at least for now, is the rise in prices. \n\n     Mr. Kuroda tried to make the best of the situation in his Monday remarks, saying more-entrenched inflation could \"lead to a full-fledged rise in wages\" next year. \n\n     He referred in the speech to a recent survey by Tsutomu Watanabe, a University of Tokyo professor and former Bank of Japan official, that asked consumers in several countries how they would react if the price of a product they always buy in the supermarket went up by 10%. \n\n     The survey found 56% of Japanese consumers would stick to their buying habits, compared with 43% in August 2021 -- a shift Mr. Kuroda called an improvement. The latest figure in the U.S. was 64%. \n\n     Social-media commentators said they didn't see anything improving. A Twitter user said people had no choice when buying daily essentials. \"Everyone is in trouble. We do not accept it. Don't be foolish,\" she wrote. \n\n     Fast Retailing Co., which operates Uniqlo clothing stores, said this week it planned to raise prices in Japan on some items in its autumn and winter collection, such as a fleece jacket that will cost Yen2,990, equivalent to $22, up from Yen1,990 previously. It named the weak yen as one reason. \n\n     Opposition parties are seizing on such cases to attack Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose ruling party is expected to cruise to victory in elections for Parliament's less-powerful upper chamber in July. Polls show Mr. Kishida enjoys widespread support, but inflation is one of his few weak points. \n\n     The opposition Constitutional Democratic Party has named inflation as its top campaign issue. It accused the Bank of Japan of ignoring the yen's fall and suggested it would look at raising interest rates to prop up the yen. \n\n     Mr. Kuroda has repeatedly rejected that idea, saying the economy still needs the stimulus provided by low interest rates. By contrast, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates quickly to fight inflation, helping push up the dollar. \n\n     Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow

prices near their highest levels in almost a decade this past quarter. Slowing growth may be the biggest threat to the rally. \n\n     Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, finished June not far from where it came into April, rising 7.7% to $116.26 since the start of the quarter through Wednesday. That was little consolation to drivers at the gas station or truckers and airlines buying diesel and jet fuel as they adjusted to record prices during the first lasting stretch of over-$100-a-barrel crude in almost 10 years. Not since 2013 has a quarter brought a higher average daily closing price for Brent-crude contracts, according to Dow Jones data. \n\n     Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, anxiety about global oil supplies ha s collided with growing demand as the world emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. That tension accelerated in early June after China eased its latest round of lockdowns, boosting demand and helping send Brent futures briefly spiking above $120 a barrel. \n\n     Meanwhile, oil producers have responded with only limited new investments in pumping more oil, chastened by environmentalist scrutiny of fossil fuels and by their record of overinvestment during previous price surges. That has kept supply forecasts tight. \n\n     \"The big picture is that global demand for oil is back to, if not exceeding, pre-Covid levels, but global supply is not,\" said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Kansas-based investment firm TortoiseEcofin. \"We're continuing to have this persistently undersupplied oil market.\" \n\n     Pricier crude hits U.S. consumers in the form of higher gasoline prices, which reached an average of $5 a gallon nationally for the first time this month. By raising costs for companies, higher fuel prices also contribute to faster inflation in a broad set of goods and services. \n\n     Meanwhile, prices for diesel, the fuel of choice for many commercial vehicles, are up about 78% from last year at $5.780 a gallon, according to AAA, further raising companies' fuel costs. Jet fuel prices have also rocketed higher. \n\n     That has made crude oil a key driver of the soaring inflation that has rattled financial markets this spring. Central banks' mounting response, which this month brought the biggest Federal Reserve interest-rate increase since 1994, have fueled fears of a potential recession. \n\n     Those concerns, investors say, are one of the few factors working to keep a lid on oil prices. As growth fears have mounted, crude prices through Wednesday were on track in June to record their first down month since November 2021. \n\n     \"There is a growth slowdown happening, and if you enter into that situation, there's going to be a demand drop for oil,\" said Maneesh Deshpande, a Barclays analyst. \"That's part of the reason why oil has sold off a bit.\" \n\n     Mr. Deshpande's analysis notes that energy-company stocks -- still the only S&P 500 sector that has posted a gain so far this year -- have also fallen sharply in recent weeks. That could be a sign traders are concerned about how a future recession might hit demand. \n\n     The same trend shows up in futures markets, where far-off contracts are trading at a discount to near-term deliveries. Brent crude for delivery at the end of December costs $101.27 a barrel, somewhat lower than the near-term price, according to FactSet. The price drops to less than $93 a barrel for December 2023 deliveries. \n\n     As geopolitics roil commodity markets, governments have stepped in to try to ease conditions for drivers and other energy consumers. Western leaders are struggling to balance two goals: inflicting economic pain on Russia, a major exporter, while stanching the runaway fuel prices that have battered their citizens' wallets. \n\n     This week, the Group of Seven club of wealthy democracies was working toward a global price cap on Russian oil, aimed at cutting revenue for Russian producers while keeping the country's crude exports flowing to willing buyers in Asia. The European Union earlier moved to ban seaborne imports of Russian oil by December. \n\n     Meanwhile, the Biden administration and allies of the U.S. have laid out plans to release hundreds of millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves this year to boost supply and ease prices. \n\n     Even so, moves like those haven't brought relief to fuel prices, in part because many refiners don't have the spare capacity to turn more oil into gasoline. Instead, U.S. producers are sending more crude abroad than ever before. Oil exports from the Gulf Coast likely hit a record 3.3 million barrels a day in the three months through June, research firm Rystad Energy estimated. \n\n     As supply concerns persist, there is little sign of easing prices for fuel consumers barring a recession that would ease demand for crude, Pimco analysts wrote in a note to investors this week. \n\n     \"Many commodity markets face a very fine balance this summer,\" the Pimco team said. \"Our concern now is that additional energy supply disruptions...will require demand rationing, since there is so little capacity to increase supply in the short term.\" \n\n     Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  June 30, 2022 08:24 ET (12:24 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at":

Feelgood (Sweden) has been consolidated from 1 July \n2021 onwards.  Estonia and the Netherlands did not have a significant \neffect on revenue during the reporting period. \n \n2) Adjustments are material items outside the ordinary course of \nbusiness, associated with acquisition-related expenses, restructuring \n-related expenses, net gains and losses on the sale of assets, strategic \nprojects and other items affecting comparability. \n \nVille Iho, CEO: Demand is strong, but supply challenges limit growth and \nweigh on profitability \n \nStrong continuous demand supported Terveystalo's growth in the second \nquarter of the year. Revenue increased by almost 16 % year-on-year, of \nwhich Sweden's share was approximately 9%-points. Acquisitions \ncontributed about a half of the revenue growth in Finland. Booking rates \nfor health services remained very high and supply limited organic sales \ngrowth in most services. The supply that fell short of the targets, the \nweakened sales mix and the personnel costs raised by acquisitions, among \nother things, weighed on profitability despite strong demand and growth. \nAdjusted EBITA decreased by 18.2 percent to 24.1 million euros and was \n7.6 percent of the revenue. \n \nThe supply grew modestly compared to a year ago, still focusing on \ndigital services. However, we succeeded in recruiting new professionals \nduring the period and the number of private practitioners increased by \nmore than 10 percent. This positive development will be reflected in the \nactual supply figures with a delay. To strengthen the supply, we are \nmoving even more of our development efforts into solutions that help our \nprofessionals work more efficiently. Job satisfaction at Terveystalo \ncontinues at high level with Employee Net Promoter Score, eNPS reaching \n30 in the latest survey. \n \nThe number of Covid-19 tests decreased according to our assumptions, \nwhile other diagnostics are yet to return to the pre-pandemic levels. \nThe sales mix was also negatively affected by the supply falling short \nof the targets, as the appointments of contracted customers took \ncapacity from higher-margin private customer care chains. Personnel \ncosts increased because of acquisitions, growth investments in new \nbusinesses, and proactive recruitment. \n \nThe Swedish business continued to develop according to our plans. In the \nsecond quarter, we continued with complementary acquisitions and \nexpanded the range of services for new payer groups. \n \nThe number of digital appointments continued to grow strongly, 28 \npercent year-on-year. Outside of our own services, Terveystalo's digital \nsolutions are being piloted for the first time by public sector \ncustomers. Our goal is to continue to lead the renewal of our industry \nin Finland, Sweden and in the future in new markets. With more efficient \nuse of health data, better care management and the use of digital \nappointments it is possible to improve access to care, job satisfaction, \nas well as productivity . During the fall, in addition to developing \ndigital partnerships in the public healthcare, we will take the \noccupational health digital suite to Sweden. \n \nTerveystalo's market position and competitiveness are strong. We have \ngrown rapidly, especially in digital services, new businesses, and the \nSwedish market, and have exceeded our growth targets many times over. In \na strong demand environment, our focus has been on growth and customer \nexperience, which is also reflected in relatively faster growing \npersonnel costs. In an environment where inflationary pressures are \ncombined with a tight labor market and general economic uncertainty, we \nwill emphasize profitability in relation to growth. We continue to \ninvest in the long-term competitiveness of our business, but the \nchanging environment will be reflected in investment priorities, \ncriteria for acquisitions in new business areas and timing of \nrecruitments. We also need to review the pricing of our services so that \nit is in line with the general cost level increase. \n \nThe megatrends driving demand for health services have intensified \nduring the pandemic, and despite economic uncertainty, demand is very \nhigh. Our mission to fight for a healthier life is more relevant than \never, and as the leading private healthcare service provider in our core \nmarket, we play a key role in the lives of people and work communities. \nWe are committed to our vision of creating a world with fewer sick days \nand more healthy, happy years. \n \nTowards a better tomorrow, \n \nVille Iho \n \nOutlook \n \n  \u00b7 Demand for health services is very strong and broad based. However, \ngrowth is restricted by supply. Tight labour market and rising inflation \ncreate growing pressure on operating costs, including wages. \n  \u00b7 The demand for services related to COVID-19 is expected to decrease. \nHowever, predicting the volume is difficult. The overall demand for \nhealth services is expected to remain at a high level. The demand for \ndigital services is expected to continue to grow. \n  \u00b7 Demand from corporate customers for preventive and statutory \noccupational health services is expected to develop favourably. Demand \nfor medical care is expected to continue strong. Significant changes in \nthe employment rate may be reflected in the underlying demand. \n  \u00b7 Overall demand is expected to remain strong in the private customer \nsegment. Significant decline in general consumer confidence may, \nhowever, be reflected in the demand. \n  \u00b7 Demand from the public sector is expected to remain strong in \noccupational health, service sales, and staffing services. Revenue from \nthe outsourcing business is expected to remain stable. Tight labour \nmarket creates pressure especially on the salary costs of new and \nreplacement recruitments in staffing and outsourcing services. \n  \u00b7 Demand in the Swedish occupational health market is expected to \ndevelop favourably due to pent-up demand in the wake of the pandemic. \n \nThese views are based on the expected development of demand for \nTerveystalo' s services within the next six months, compared with the \npast six months. \n \nThe impacts of COVID-19 and the measures taken by Terveystalo \n \nDuring the second quarter of 2022, in Terveystalo' s service production \nthe share of various COVID-19-related services decreased year-on-year. \nWell-being and digital services continued to grow. \n \nThe impacts of the war in Ukraine \n \nThe indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine on Terveystalo are assessed \nto be minimal, as Terveystalo does not have business operations in, or \nwith, countries that are subject to sanctions. Indirect impacts of the \nwar may arise from supply chain disruptions, rising inflation, or \npotential disruptions in the financial markets. The war may also have a \ndelayed economic impact through declining consumer purchasing power and \nemployment. If the situation were to be prolonged, this could have a \nnegative impact on the demand for Terveystalo's services. In \nprocurement, higher prices have been reflected in the prices of certain \nsupplies (material purchasing accounts for approximately 3% of operating \nexpenditure), but the most significant purchasing agreements for 2022 \nhave already been concluded.  The rising price of electricity affects \noperating expenditure, but its impact at the Group level is relatively \nminor. Delivery times have become longer in certain categories of \nproducts and materials, such as healthcare equipment, due to component \nshortages. \n \nRising inflation creates growing pressure to increase wages. Wage \nincreases are determined by collective bargaining in the Finnish \nhealthcare industry regarding nurses, for example (approximately 43% of \nemployees). Wage inflation is also visible in other professionals' \nrecruitments. Most of the physicians who work for Terveystalo are \nprivate practitioners (approximately 96%). The financial risk associated \nwith inflation is mitigated by Terveystalo's ability to price its \nservices. \n \nKey figures \n \n+-------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----- \n--+-------+ \n\n  (MORE TO FOLLOW) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  July 19, 2022 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.900983Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T15:18:14.630409Z", "inner_id": 99, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}, {"id": 7732, "annotations": [{"id": 6818, "completed_by": 5, "result": [{"value": {"start": 219, "end": 235, "text": "currency effects", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "400015", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 660, "end": 668, "text": "Net debt", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "569567", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 995, "end": 1007, "text": "supply chain", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "234303", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 1296, "end": 1312, "text": "currency effects", "labels": ["Supply Chain Issues"]}, "id": "233961", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4064, "end": 4072, "text": "invasion", "labels": ["War"]}, "id": "605708", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4102, "end": 4121, "text": "humanitarian crisis", "labels": ["Pandemic"]}, "id": "212352", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4246, "end": 4267, "text": "currency fluctuations", "labels": ["Exchange Rates"]}, "id": "192690", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4273, "end": 4289, "text": "rising inflation", "labels": ["Inflation"]}, "id": "249399", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 4327, "end": 4338, "text": "fuel prices", "labels": ["Energy Prices"]}, "id": "824430", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}, {"value": {"start": 6521, "end": 6529, "text": "IFRS \n16", "labels": ["Monetary Policy"]}, "id": "968706", "from_name": "cause_span", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels", "origin": "prediction"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": false, "created_at": "2025-03-27T13:45:41.956144Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T13:45:41.956158Z", "draft_created_at": null, "lead_time": 369.155, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 10, "unique_id": "82345911-01a0-4a8d-8fd4-88e37397a2bd", "import_id": null, "last_action": null, "task": 7732, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "parent_prediction": 2159, "parent_annotation": null, "last_created_by": null}], "file_upload": "d567f85c-task2_df.csv", "drafts": [], "predictions": [2159], "data": {"inner_id": 458, "text": "Mekonomen: Interim report January - June 2022\n\nApril 1 - June 30, 2022 \n \n  \u00b7 Net sales increased 5 percent to SEK 3,357 M (3,210).

It is also very satisfying that, during the \nquarter, we took an important step and strengthened our position through \nthe acquisition of Koivunen, affording us a market-leading position in \nFinland and Estonia. The acquisition also expands our operations to \nLatvia and Lithuania. At the same time, generally rising inflation has \ncreated a cautious trend in several of our markets, which, combined with \nunfavorable currency fluctuations, impacted our profitability during the \nquarter. We now put full focus on using our insights, by acting \ndecisively and methodically to ensure continued profitable growth. \n \nAcquisition of Koivunen - a key step \nFor many years, MEKO has had a successful strategy for creating value \nthrough carefully selected acquisitions. On July 1 when Koivunen became \na part of MEKO, we have established ourselves as the leading player in \nFinland, where we previously had limited operations, and in Estonia, \nwhere we were not represented at all. The acquisition also expands our \noperations to Latvia and Lithuania. The company had 1,740 MSEK in net \nsales and an EBIT margin of 5.6 percent in 2021. The distribution \nchannels include concept-affiliated and independent workshops \nanddistributors, industrial customers and export. Koivunen is a \nprosperous company with strong brands that will continue to be developed \nin their existing form as a separate business area. This important step \neastward means that we are closing in on our goal of becoming the best \nand most comprehensive partner for everyone that services and maintains \nvehicles in Northern Europe. \n \nCautious trend in several markets while Poland reports strong growth \nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a humanitarian crisis with \nmany other knock-on effects, such as challenges related to sourcing of \nmaterials and increased prices, combined with currency fluctuations and \nrising inflation. This, combined with high energy and fuel prices, \nresulted in reduced consumer purchasing power and, consequently as \ncautious trend in several of our markets during the quarter. The \nNorwegian and, to a certain extent, the Danish market were affected to a \ngreater extent. For the Group as a whole, net sales increased by 5 \npercent to SEK 3,357 M (3,210) during the second quarter, which is \nconfirmation of the stability of our underlying business. Organic growth \namounted to slightly more than 2 percent, with Inter-Team in Poland \nstanding out in a positive sense with its organic growth of more than 8 \npercent. \n \nCurrency fluctuations and cost increases impacted profitability \nProfitability for the second quarter was impacted by the changes in the \nmarket. EBIT amounted to SEK 185 M (280) and the EBIT margin to 5 \npercent (9). A total of SEK -26 M (-) in items affecting comparability \nrelated to the acquisition of Koivunen was charged to earnings for the \nquarter. Adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 240 M (314) and the adjusted EBIT \nmargin to 7 percent (10). The gross margin rose to 46.3 percent (45.5), \nlargely thanks to previously implemented price adjustments. The change \nin earnings compared with the corresponding quarter of the preceding \nyear was due in full to cost increases resulting from generally higher \ninflationary pressure combined with unfavorable currency fluctuations. \nThe situation is being managed resolutely and methodically, and we are \ndrawing on our tried-and-tested ability to transform. We launched \nseveral targeted activities in various parts of the operations to reduce \nour cost base and secure long-term profitable growth. Our flexibility, \ntogether with our underlying stable business, makes me confident that \nthe efforts are having the intended effect. \n \nSolid financial position enables accessibility and continued growth \nOur financial position remains solid. After the end of the quarter, we \nsigned a new credit facility agreement of SEK 1,965 M, which replaces \nearlier financing of EUR 178 M. This provides us with both flexibility \nand strong resilience. Net debt amounted to SEK 2,649 M (2,549) at the \nend of the second quarter and net debt/EBITDA excluding effects of IFRS \n16 amounted to 2.4 times (2.0), which is in the lower end of our target \nrange. Cash flow from operating activities was positive during the \nquarter and amounted to SEK 387 M (406). We can see major opportunities \nto increase sales and market shares going forward through responsible \ninvestment in increased availability for our customers. Our strategic \ndecision to strengthen our stocks of attractive components and spare \nparts stands firm and we are now at approximately the same levels as at \nthe close of the first quarter. \n \nWell equipped to continue our journey \nI can confirm that we have a fundamentally stable business and that we \nhave demonstrated that we can manage difficulties and challenging market \nconditions. Today, MEKO has many established brands, covering various \nwishes and needs, which together with our proven ability to balance our \ncost base and extract synergies, will enable continued long-term, \nsustainable growth and profitability. We stand well equipped to now \nfurther strengthen our position in all of our markets through \ntransformation toward an even more sustainable and profitable company. \nWe aim to be the best and most complete partner for everyone that \nservices and maintains vehicles in our markets - today and in the \nfuture. \n \nPehr Oscarson \nPresident and CEO \n \nThis information is such information that MEKO AB (publ) is obliged to \nmake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the \nSecurities Market Act.

{"inner_id": 470, "text": "OPEC+ to Weigh Production Cut to Bolster Oil Prices -- Update\n\n  By Benoit Faucon and Summer Said \n\n \n\n     OPEC+ is set to consider Wednesday its most drastic reduction of production since the pandemic began in order to help prop up falling oil prices, a move that could put pressure on global economic growth. \n\n     The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Moscow-led allies, collectively known as OPEC+, is considering a cut of more than 1 million barrels a day, delegates in the group said. \n\n     Concerns about a slowing global economy have dragged oil prices down at their fastest pace since the Covid-19 outbreak began in early 2020, prompting OPEC+ to consider ways to prop up the price of oil. Any move by OPEC+ to raise oil prices could put further pressure on Western consumers already hurting from high energy costs while also helping Russia -- one of the biggest energy producers in the world -- fill its state coffers as it wages war against Ukraine. \n\n     Oil prices had shot up over $100 a barrel and stayed there for months but Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, is now down 23% this quarter, falling to $87.96 a barrel last week, and its swiftest decline since 2020. \n\n     Falling oil prices are often a pressure-release valve for the global economy, reducing costs as demand falls in a cycle that repeats itself. OPEC+ often holds itself out as a regulator of the oil market, aiming to keep supply and demand balanced, but a production cut would support prices at a time when they are at historically high levels. \n\n     Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions caused energy prices to soar, raising the price of gasoline in the U.S. and around the world. While prices have started coming down, a cut to production comes amid rising inflation, slowing growth and fears of recession. \n\n     Adel Hamaizia, a visiting fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University, said the move could play a role in making recessions worse in some countries. He explained that the production cut could push inflation higher and hurt oil demand further. \n\n     The U.S. has asked OPEC+ to pump more oil to help bring down the price of gasoline. OPEC+ accelerated some production increases over the summer ahead of President Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia and made a small increase in August but has since worked to reverse those moves. \n\n     In the past months, the U.S. has responded to rising oil prices by tapping into its strategic stockpiles. Christyan Malek, global head of energy strategy at JP Morgan, said Saudi Arabia's support for a cut to production could partly be a response to the U.S. decision to release stockpiled oil, which has helped lower the price of gas for American consumers. \n\n     The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\n     The production cut could also accelerate the world's changing flows of oil sales since the Ukraine invasion. China, which is seeing slowing economic growth, is turning to Russia for cheaper oil. At the same time, Europe is being forced to buy more expensive oil from Middle Eastern countries since it stopped buying oil from Russia over the Ukraine invasion. \n\n     Oil prices have been falling in part due to slowing growth in China, which has been hit by persistent Covid-prevention measures. The World Bank has said it expects China's economy to expand 2.8% in 2022, down from a 4.3% forecast in June. \n\n     Because the ultimate decision about a production cut will be hotly debated, the group decided to meet in person in Vienna on Wednesday for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, the delegates said. Other options being considered include a smaller reduction of 500,000 barrels a day or as much as 1.5 million barrels a day, the delegates said. \n\n     Russia and Saudi energy ministries didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. \n\n     The option to cut more than 1 million barrels a day is backed by Russia, the group's biggest non-OPEC partner. \n\n     A costly war, lower energy prices and a new round of Western sanctions threaten to bear down on Russia's already embattled economy. The country is trying to maximize its windfall from soaring energy prices -- Russia's main economic strength -- after the government's budget reported a deficit due to diminished energy revenue. \n\n     \"Cuts and higher prices would certainly be at least a short term win for Russia as we approach winter,\" said Mr. Hamaizia. \n\n     But the cartel's biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, has some reservations on the size of the cut, the delegates said. \n\n     OPEC+ agreed last month to cut oil production for the first time in over a year, saying it would cut about 100,000 barrels a day amid fears of a global recession. \n\n     The move ended an 18-month era of production increases for OPEC+. The group slowly brought crude back onto the market after a dramatic cut during the pandemic when demand plunged. \n\n     The Saudis have pursued a more aggressive oil policy this year as oil prices rose during the Ukraine war. Higher oil prices have helped Saudi Arabia become one of the world's fastest-growing economies this year and infused with cash an ambitious economic overhaul launched by the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \n\n     In one way, an OPEC+ cut won't make much meaningful difference in the day-to-day oil market. The group has been undershooting its targets by more than 3 million barrels a day for much of the year, with Russian production falling and big producers like Nigeria and Angola struggling to invest enough to raise output. \n\n     Write to Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  Corrections & Amplifications\n\n  This story was corrected on October 2, 2022.

Nearly 90% of the items in the inflation basket now have an inflation rate above 2%, and more than a quarter have one above 10%, according to the economist. Furthermore, unlike in the U.S. and U.K., core goods inflation doesn't seem to have topped out yet, Allen-Reynolds says. The easing of global supply-chain problems seems likely to bring goods inflation down next year, the economist says. However, Capital Economics suspects that wage growth will accelerate, preventing core inflation from falling sharply. The economic research firm forecasts the eurozone core inflation rate will remain above 2% for the next couple of years.

This year sterling was hurt by interest-rate differentials in favor of the dollar, a deterioration of the U.K.'s post-Brexit current account and a spike in fiscal policy uncertainty but the currency should remain a major investment vehicle over the longer term, she says. If sterling does stabilize, companies that will benefit include domestic earners with a high degree of operating leverage such as housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, kitchen supplier Howden Joinery Group and retailer Next, she says. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0926 GMT - Inflation is set to remain elevated in 2023, albeit likely peaking in the first half of next year, says Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse. Inflation is now \"obviously materially too high,\" he says in a webinar. Credit Suisse expects inflation to decline after the anticipated peak in 1H 2023 but not to previous levels, Strobaek says. Credit Suisse sees a return to 2% inflation--that central banks are targeting--as unlikely anytime soon. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0921 GMT - Core bonds will play a more relevant role in bond portfolios in 2023, says Philipp Lisibach, chief global strategist and head of global investment strategy at Credit Suisse, in a webinar. \"Yields have now reached levels that offer some protection against adverse market effects that are likely to occur as we enter a period of substantial economic uncertainty,\" he says in an outlook for next year. The current higher yield levels will allow portfolio diversification benefits to return and contribution from bonds to portfolio returns to start to rise, he says. \"Yields have made a comeback and offer investors an anchor in portfolios,\" Lisibach says. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0910 GMT - Investors anticipating central banks to start cutting interest rates in 2023 might be disappointed, Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, says. \"We don't expect central banks to start to cut [interest rates] in 2023,\" he says in a webinar on 2023 outlook. This is very unlikely to happen, he says. Credit Suisse expects central banks to continue to tighten monetary policy in the first half of 2023 with inflation also peaking in 1H before starting to decline.

Three-month copper is up 0.5% to $7,937.50 a metric ton while aluminum is down 0.2% to $2,375.50 a ton. Meanwhile, gold is 0.3% higher $1,743.90 a troy ounce. \"It is looking increasingly likely the [Federal Reserve] will increase the funds rate by 50 basis points next month compared to the 75 basis-point increases delivered in the past four meetings,\" Joseph Capurso, analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note. A slower rate of hikes would be bullish for risk assets such as metals, as investors steer clear of the dollar. (yusuf.khan@wsj.com) \n\n  0839 GMT - Fixed-income assets will prove more attractive as monetary-policy tightening likely to slow in 2023, according to Credit Suisse's latest investment outlook. The Swiss bank sees recessions in the eurozone and U.K. and a slump in growth in the U.S. and China in 2023 after a 2022 that saw aggressive rate hikes from central banks and slowing economic growth. But with inflation likely to normalize in 2023, and interest-rate cuts unlikely, fixed-income assets should become more attractive to hold and offer renewed diversification benefits in portfolios, the research says. Long U.S. vs eurozone duration government bonds, emerging-market currency debt and investment-grade credit should offer interesting opportunities in 2023, the outlook says.

Even if the Fed slows the pace of rate rises, the European Central Bank and other central banks are likely to follow suit, Commerzbank currency analyst Esther Reichelt says in a note. \"Sentiment towards the dollar is only likely to shift on a sustainable basis if we see clearer signs of a recession of the U.S. economy,\" she says. \"At that point Fed rate cuts will be back on the agenda very quickly.\" The DXY dollar index falls 0.3% to 107.562. (renae.dyer@wsj.com) \n\n  0743 GMT - The global economic expansion is expected to slow in 2023 as financial conditions tighten and the upcoming winter aggravates China's Covid-19 outbreaks and Europe's natural gas problems, JPMorgan economists say in a note. The global economy isn't at imminent risk of sliding into recession, as adverse supply-side shocks are fading fast and this is reflected in a slide in global inflation toward3.5% in early 2023, the U.S. bank says. \"We think it is a mistake to rule out a soft-landing scenario (20% probability) in which recession is avoided,\" JPM says. In this scenario, sluggish growth and the removal of supply-side constraints are sufficient to push inflation down toward 2% without a sharp deterioration in labor markets. (xavier.fontdegloria@wsj.com) \n\n  0730 GMT - Germany's 1.30% October 2027 Bobl, which will be reopened for EUR3 billion at auction on Tuesday, is \"rich\"--or expensive--on the domestic curve, say Citi's rates strategists in a note. However, this Bobl has cheapened 34 basis points versus swaps over the past six weeks, they add. The October 2027 Bobl is trading at a yield of 1.975%, according to Tradeweb, while the average yield came in at 2.11% at the previous auction on Oct. 25. The upcoming sale will be Germany's last five-year debt auction this year. (emese.bartha@wsj.com) \n\n  0739 GMT - Ethiopia's inflation rate will likely trend lower over the coming months, aided by the arrival of new harvests across one of Africa's top corn and wheat growers, says Oxford Economics Africa. Oxford expects Ethiopia's inflation rate, already at multi-year highs to slow to 31.2% on year in the final quarter of 2022 from 32.1% on year in the third quarter, amid improved food supplies. \"Authorities are seeking to combat food price inflation through initiatives aimed at increasing food supply, such as wheat irrigation schemes and the improvement of agricultural productivity,\" Oxford says in a note. \"Headline inflation is projected to ease from 33.2% in 2022 to 28.7% in 2023 as strong annual base effects suppress m-o-m figures.\" (nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com; @Nicholasbariyo)

and the Markets Disagree on Wages and Inflation. That&apos;s a Problem. -- Barrons.com\n\nBy Megan Cassella \n\n     The economic data released this past week appeared to tell a clear story: Consumer demand was falling, as evidenced by slower retail sales. Wholesale prices were cooling, suggesting that further inflation relief was on the horizon. The message seemed to be that the Federal Reserve's policy tightening efforts were working, and equity markets initially climbed on the data. \n\n     But then, Fed officials hit the airwaves singing a different tune. Despite abundant signs of economic slowing, they would remain steadfast in their pledge to hike interest rates in coming months. \"We still have some ways to go,\" said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell. Declines extended through Friday. \n\n     The episode was perhaps the most obvious example yet of the growing disconnect between Wall Street and the Fed over the most likely path forward for monetary policy. Markets have been watching inflation slow over the past several months and anxiously waiting for the central bank to pivot, worried that continued tightening means near-certain recession. But for the Fed, the welcome progress on inflation so far is simply in line with their forecasts -- and their forecasts also say that they still need to raise interest rates above 5%. \n\n     \"Financial markets are like, 'It's cool, but it's not cold.' And the Fed's like, 'It's not even tepid yet,' \" says Diane Swonk, chief economist with KPMG US. \"They're speaking different languages, even though they're both talking about inflation.\" \n\n     That divide is likely to persist, or even deepen, as long as the labor market stays tight and wage growth remains strong. While inflation has clearly peaked and parts of the economy have begun to slow -- two factors boosting market optimism -- Fed officials are laser-focused on ensuring that price growth in nonhousing core services sectors is falling, as well, before they'll be satisfied that their efforts are working. \n\n     The Fed's concern is that even as goods prices deflate and housing costs slow, inflation will hit a floor well above its 2% target, due to persistent strength in those \"supercore\" services. And because of the way that labor costs affect service prices, Fed officials have zeroed in on wages as a way to gauge whether their fears are coming true. \n\n     Some market participants have questioned that approach, arguing that wages were pushed higher by Covid price shocks and will resolve on their own without the Fed forcing a rise in unemployment. Others took recent progress in average hourly earnings in December's jobs report as a sign that, alongside broader economic cooling, the labor problem was easing. \n\n     The Fed isn't convinced. Other signs of progress in the inflation fight are just window dressing until labor demand and supply fall back into line. \"It's one piece of the inflation puzzle that hasn't really fallen into place fully yet,\" says Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \n\n     The longer the market discounts the importance that the Fed places on wages, the harder the bank's job becomes. By its own standards, the Fed has been fairly forthcoming about this, warning that any \"unwarranted easing\" in financial markets in response to policy changes would complicate the path forward. If souring economic data spark a rally due to widespread anticipation that the end of rate hikes is near, it could force a somewhat backward outcome: further tightening and, in turn, a higher risk of a harder landing. \n\n     \"The Fed can't afford for the financial markets to get too far ahead of them right now,\" Swonk says, adding that such a dynamic heightens the possibility of prematurely reflating the economy. \"They know what history tells them, and that's not a risk they're willing to take.\" \n\n     The old mantra of \"don't fight the Fed\" still rings true. But this time, it's because failing to recognize the central bank's path forward risks worse fallout for everyone. \n\n     Write to Megan Cassella at megan.cassella@dowjones.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow

double-digit boost to its fourth-quarter sales, helped by higher prices for its cookies and candies, as well as added revenue from recent acquisitions. \n\n     The Chicago-based maker of Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers said Tuesday that sales climbed 14% in the recent period to $8.7 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $8.33 billion, according to FactSet. \n\n     Mondelez, which also makes Sour Patch Kids candy, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Toblerone, raised prices in the U.S. again in December as it battled higher costs. Executives said consumers haven't shied away from its snacks and cookies so far. \n\n     Chief Financial Officer Luca Zaramella said during an earnings call that the company expects another year of double-digit inflation, driven by higher costs for labor, energy and packaging. \n\n     Shares rose 1.6% to $66.50 in after-hours trading. \n\n     Other packaged-food giants, including Kellogg Co., Kraft Heinz Co. and Conagra Brands Inc., have also hiked prices, saying the moves are necessary to offset their own climbing costs for ingredients, transportation and labor. Conagra, which makes Hunt's ketchup and Slim Jim meat sticks, recently said it doesn't plan on taking more significant pricing actions this fiscal year, assuming inflation doesn't rise further. \n\n     Mondelez's quarterly sales were also led higher by incremental revenue from recent acquisitions, said Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put. That includes the purchases of energy bar maker Clif Bar & Co. and baked goods company Chipita Global SA, deals valued at $2.9 billion and $2 billion, respectively. \n\n     Profit declined to $583 million, or 42 cents per share, from $1 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year ago, led lower by factors such as higher acquisition integration costs and unfavorable impacts from currency and commodity derivatives. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 73 cents, above the 70 cents analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. \n\n     For 2023, the company guided for organic net revenue growth of 5% to 7% and for high single-digit growth to its adjusted earnings per share, without factoring in currency fluctuations. \n\n     The company estimates the impact of foreign exchange will weigh on revenue growth by about 1%, and adjusted per-share earnings will be hit by about 4 cents. \n\n     Mr. Van de Put says the company is making progress in its strategy to focus on its chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories. The company recently agreed to sell Trident, Dentyne and other gum brands in developed markets for $1.35 billion. \n\n     Write to Kathryn Hardison at kathryn.hardison@wsj.com \n\n \n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n  January 31, 2023 19:17 ET (00:17 GMT)\n"}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2025-03-08T16:21:59.901434Z", "updated_at": "2025-03-27T11:05:21.085930Z", "inner_id": 104, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 1, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 14, "updated_by": 5, "comment_authors": []}]
